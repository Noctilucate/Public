<p>Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Hi!!</p><p>Welcome to my new 100% self-indulgent fic. I LOVE found families and the concept of Shen brothers, so I came up with this story with a slow burn enemies to brothers (and enemies to lovers with a confused Liu Qingge). Luo Binghe is a kid at the beginning of the fic, so when he grows up maybe the tags of the ships will be updated or maybe not &gt;:3</p><p>This will be a story with a slow evolution of the characters' relationship and themselves. I warn you that Shen Yuan at first is blinded by his opinions of the book and Shen Jiu is a lonely creature who absolutely mistrusts everyone.</p><p> </p><p> <i>English it's not my first language.

<h2 class="heading">Shen Yuan can’t trust the scum villain</h2>
</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Shen Yuan didn’t want to die or reincarnate in Shen Qingqiu. Of course, he also doesn’t want to be dismembered by the protagonist of the absurd novel in which he is trapped.</p><p>His situation is frustrating and if it weren't for the system, he would have already tried to run away. But he is stuck and it doesn’t matter if he is afraid or tired of parasitizing one life that doesn’t belong to him or wants to cry for the family and friends that he has lost forever. Shen Yuan has no choice but to move on and fight to survive.</p><p>And he is exhausted. In a very short time, he has had to confront the skinner, then rescued Liu Qingge from a qi deviation, and now, when he finally believes that he can rest, Xiu Ya points at his neck.</p><p>For an incomprehensible reason, the real Shen Qingqiu stands before him. Although now both share the same body, the gaze of the original is icier and threatening. He has cruel eyes and his pulse doesn’t waver at attacking someone identical to him.</p><p>“Who are you?” He demands. His voice, posture, and movements are arrogant. Shen Yuan discovers that the scum villain is obviously just as dangerous as the protagonist. Maybe worse. The person who threatens him is unjustly cruel, has abused children, and would have let Liu Qingge die.</p><p>Shen Yuan is paralyzed with terror.</p><p>“Who are you?” He insists. “How dare you appropriate my body, demon?”</p><p>Shen Yuan doesn’t understand what happened, why before they were one and now two, but he knows that he is still as human as Shen Qingqiu himself.</p><p>The sword grazes his neck, scratching him, and Shen Yuan finally reacts.</p><p>“I’m not a demon!” He yells, almost crying. “We are in the Lingxi Caves, demons cannot hide their presence here.”</p><p>There are many things in the world of PIDW that don't make any sense and perhaps their unfolding is one of those inexplicable plots, but Shen Yuan knows the rest of logical worldbuilding. Trembling, he raises his hands in peace and tries to look into Shen Qingqiu's cold eyes.</p><p>“I don't know what happened either...”</p><p>“I felt your soul,” he cuts him off with an angry hiss. “You tried to steal my body. Kill me. Take away everything that belongs to me.”</p><p>The scum villain hates him with an intensity worse than Luo Binghe's and Shen Yuan understands that he will probably die again. And this time, no one will miss him. Because he is a thief, a usurper, he shouldn't have been there or interfered in Shen Qingqiu's life.</p><p>Yet his will clings to life. He has already died once and it is painful and pitiful and frustrating. The system has granted him a second chance which has been a farce. It is unfair.</p><p>He wants to live. He desperately wants to live.</p><p>“I didn’t want to! They gave me no choice!”</p><p>The system beeps in his head, warning him of the consequences of revealing the truth. Shen Yuan grimaces. He wishes the system had disappeared when their bodies doubled and Shen Qingqiu snatched Xiu Ya from him to corner him against a wall. Or that the system had stayed in Shen Qingqiu's head.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu narrows his eyes.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“I will die if I tell you.”</p><p>His answer makes Shen Qingqiu's expression darkened even more.</p><p>“Then there is no point in letting you live.”</p><p>“Wait!” He screams before the sword cuts his throat. Shen Yuan's heart beats so fast that his chest aches. He takes a deep breath as he carefully chooses his words. “Right now I can't tell you the truth. Something prevents me from doing that.”  He speaks slowly, watching the scum villain's reaction and the system's warnings. “But I can find other ways to explain myself.”</p><p>“Try,” he demands. “Give me a reason why I should let you live.” </p><p>“I know the future.”</p><p>The system beeps again and Shen Yuan raises a hand to his head. <em> Wait! </em> He demands before the system begins to deduct points. <em> I have a plan. </em></p><p>It seems that he has finally caught Shen Qingqiu's attention, as there is a gleam of curiosity in his eyes. Xiu Ya, however, continues to rub his neck.</p><p>“Probe that.”</p><p>“When you leave Lingxi Caves, you will discover that Cang Qiong Sect is undergoing a demonic invasion. It is led by Sha Hualing, a demonic saintess. She will challenge you to three duels. You will win the first, she will win the second, and Luo Binghe the third.”</p><p>“Luo Binghe?” He repeats with surprise. “My useless disciple?”</p><p>His words make Shen Yuan angry, but he hides his emotions. He needs to convince the scum villain to follow the plot.</p><p>“Yes. It could be said that it is his destiny.”</p><p>For some incomprehensible reason, Shen Qingqiu purses his lips in a wry smile.</p><p>“Of course, that stupid child has a glorious destiny.”</p><p>Shen Yuan doesn't care what Shen Qingqiu is thinking or why he hates Luo Binghe so much. He only has one chance to survive and he clings to it desperately.</p><p>“Let's make a deal,” he proposes to him. “Come out and stop the demonic invasion just like I told you. And you will see that I am telling the truth.” He inhales before making a crucial decision. “If Luo Binghe doesn't fight, I will die.”</p><p>“Why are you telling me such an obvious weakness?”</p><p>“Because if I said the truth and the three fights happen as I have told you, you will save the sect. And it also means that I know the future. And honestly, your future sucks and you need me to survive.”</p><p>Shen Qingqiu huffs.</p><p>“You lie. Do you think I'm stupid? You have said that you will die if Luo Binghe doesn’t fulfill his fate and now you are trying to convince me that you can change mine. It is contradictory.”</p><p>“It’s not! Some events have to happen or I will die. And others that I can change. For example, I have prevented Liu Qingge from dying in a qi deviation. You can ask him.”</p><p>Shen Yuan waits, terrified and trembling, for Shen Qingqiu's verdict. The villain watches over him with slightly higher interest than an insect. His decision lingers for minutes until he finally pulls the sword away and Shen Yuan breathes in relief. He is no longer so terrified when Shen Qingqiu grabs his arm and drags him through the caverns.</p><p>Outside, a chaos of screams, the smell of blood, and the clash of swords await them. Shen Qingqiu nods indifferently and a gleam of interest in his ruthless eyes.</p><p>“At least this part of what you said is true,” he comments before dragging him along.</p><p>Instead of joining the battle and helping his disciples, Shen Qingqiu chooses a secondary path to Qing Jing Peak. Shen Yuan doesn’t dare to reproach him about anything. He is terrified of the calm and impudence with which he ignores that threat. In silence, Shen Qingqiu leads him to his bamboo house. Once inside, he ties his wrists with immortal cables and pushes him into a secondary room.</p><p>“If you tried to deceive me, I will kill you,” he promises before locking him up.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>It seems that the usurper hasn’t lied to him, but Shen Jiu distrusts his words and prophecies.</p><p>At least the beginning turns out to be true. There is a demonic invasion and a demoness that presents herself as Sha Hualing challenges him to three duels. Not very surprising, the usurper might know if he is allied with demons. It is also no surprise that he wins the first duel (Shen Jiu is, after all, the legendary sword Xiu Ya and an immortal master), nor that the cowardly Sha Hualing defeats a disciple.</p><p>Of course, Shen Jiu finds some pleasure in seeing the unbearable Liu Qingge's sister defeated, who arrives just in time to see her beloved sister fall.</p><p>Shen Jiu brushes his lips with his fan. The third duel is the most difficult of the three. His enemy is the most dangerous demon, though Liu Qingge offers without hesitation. Shen Jiu frowns as he considers whether to follow the usurper's directions. He may be lying. He likely lied. Luo Binghe will lose and with him, the sect will also lose. But if Luo Binghe wins, that is a surreal event and completely impossible to predict. It will mean that the usurper was telling the truth and knows the future.</p><p>And manipulating the future is very tempting.</p><p>“Wait,” he hits Liu Qingge’s chest with his fan, stopping him. “Luo Binghe will fight.”</p><p>Everyone screams in amazement and surprise, his disciple opens his eyes in ridiculous joy, and Liu Qingge frowns.</p><p>“Who?” He turns around to discover Luo Binghe. “HIM? Are you crazy, Shen Qingqiu? You are going to kill that child.”</p><p>The boy in question steps forward despite Ning Yingying’s efforts to stop him with a tearful hug.</p><p>“I can do it! Shizun, I will show you what I am capable of!”</p><p>His confidence is so ridiculous that Shen Jiu rolls his eyes and Liu Qingge shakes his head.</p><p>“No. I’ll do it. As the lord of Bai Zhan Peak, I must defeat these demons.”</p><p>“You are late, shidi.” Shen Jiu approaches his martial brother and touches him twice with his fan. And then he leans in to whisper into his ear. “Don’t be stupid. You just survived a qi deviation. It would be very embarrassing if our War God lost miserably to these demons.”</p><p>When he pulls away, Shen Jiu discovers that Liu Qingge is blushing. Probably out of embarrassment.</p><p>“And you disciple can?” He growls, stubborn and proud.</p><p><em> No, </em>he thinks while looking at that annoying kid with such talent.</p><p>“I trust him,” he lies, hiding his face behind his fan.</p><p>Liu Qingge crosses his arms but doesn't insist. That unexpected show of confidence makes him suspect that his martial brother still hasn't recovered from the qi deviation. <em> Perhaps the usurper is not an enemy if he has truly saved one of our strongest warriors </em>, he values. But Shen Jiu needs more evidence to understand the intentions of someone who has tried to impersonate him. And he had almost succeeded.</p><p>Luo Binghe runs like a happy puppy to a duel that is surely deadly, confirming that he is as talented as an idiot. Shen Jiu watches him curiously, not moving his fan away so that his expression doesn’t betray him. The entire sect holds its breath as an eager teenager faces off a gigantic demon, covered in poisonous spikes.</p><p>He would be amused by Liu Qingge's tension and seeing Luo Binghe be miserably defeated if it weren’t that Shen Jiu may lose because of that decision.</p><p>Shen Jiu hates the usurper even more because now he is encouraging the child he envies.</p><p>He is relieved when the miracle happens: Luo Binghe wins. The child succeeds when all seems lost. And despite the threat, he does it without a scratch. The other disciples break into applause and Shen Jiu closes his fan so tightly that the wood almost breaks. He should feel relieved and satisfied, Luo Binghe's fame belongs to him, but then he remembers the usurper's words. And he notices a bitter taste in his throat.</p><p>The child who had a mother who adored him, who has the talent to cultivate a shining path to immortality, also has an almost divine destiny. And he is left with a destroyed childhood, corrupted cultivation, and a screwed-up future according to the usurper.</p><p>It's frustrating.</p><p>Luo Binghe approaches him with bright eyes, eager for an acknowledgment that Shen Jiu refuses to give him. He turns his back and orders the other disciples to take the injured to Qian Cao Peak and fix the damage. In that instant of confusion, the defeated demon tries to attack Luo Binghe, but Liu Qingge kills him with a swift slash.</p><p>“Not bad. Your kid did well,” he acknowledges while sheaths Cheng Luan. </p><p>He is a good target to take his anger out on.</p><p>“Surprised? You should trust me more.” Shen Qingqiu plays with his fan while giving him an arrogant look, accompanied by a smirk. “But you've always had to doubt me, even when I'm right. Like today. I hope you learn your lesson dear shidi.”</p><p>Liu Qingge blushes even more. He clenches his fists and turns his back on him, presumably to eradicate the straggling demons. Honestly, Shen Jiu doesn't care. He also ignores Luo Binghe. After making sure the situation is under control, he draws his sword and returns to Qing Jing Peak. His house is silent, nothing betrays he has a prisoner locked up and for a few seconds, he fears that he has escaped. However, inside he finds the usurper still tied up.</p><p>It's disturbing that your own face looks at you with concern and fear, without a hint of elegance. The usurper is a parodic copy that could not fool anyone.</p><p>Shen Jiu is terrified that he has managed to fool everybody.</p><p>“How did it end!?”</p><p>“Shouldn't you know already?” He hisses, closing the door.</p><p>“I was right,” he guesses and relief glows in his eyes. “Do you trust me already?”</p><p>“Never.”</p><p>Shen Jiu holds the sword in silent threat as he watches over that near-perfect copy of himself. </p><p>“Your name,” he demands.</p><p>“Shen Yuan.”</p><p>“What can you tell me about your presence?”</p><p>“I don’t want to be here. I have certain... knowledge about the future and it seems like my role is to make sure that specific events happen.”</p><p>“That doesn't explain why you tried to steal my body.”</p><p>“The same... entity that brought me here wanted me to impersonate you. You have a key role for the future.”</p><p>“Despite my horrible fate?” He raises an eyebrow, sarcastic. “Your words are full of contradictions, Shen Yuan.”</p><p>Shen Yuan frowns and for a few seconds it seems like he is going to say something, but he remains silent. He doesn’t seem stupid and it is evident that he has more information than he wants to tell. It doesn’t matter. Shen Jiu is patient and cunning. In the end, he will find a way to extract that information from him.</p><p>“Next event?” He demands, impatient.</p><p>Shen Yuan takes a few seconds to reply.</p><p>“Tonight. A dream demon will attack Luo Binghe and Ning Yingying. It is an irrelevant event, they will defeat him without problems.”</p><p>Shen Jiu doesn't like to hear that the second event also affects Luo Binghe. He is suspicious, as he doesn’t believe in coincidences. However, Shen Yuan doesn't add more and it might not be wise to press him so soon.</p><p>With a sigh, Shen Jiu sheaths his sword. Perhaps he should worry about an intruder looking like him before the distant future. One thing is clear: no one else must discover Shen Yuan's existence.</p><p>“I'll let you live... for now,” he decides and Shen Yuan breathes in relief. “You will follow my rules. If you try to trick me or escape, I will kill you. Did you understand?”</p><p>Shen Yuan nods and Shen Jiu, after considering it, decides to untie him.</p>

<p>Getting killed is less terrifying than being dismembered, but of course, Shen Yuan doesn't give the scum villain ideas. Instead, he stares quietly at how Shen Qingqiu puts talismans of silence on the walls. When he finishes, Shen Qingqiu crosses his arms and re-examines the room. It is a secondary room of the bamboo house. When Shen Yuan transmigrated, it was in disuse. Now it is his new prison.</p><p>The talismans will prevent them from being heard from outside, and Shen Qingqiu has also curtained the window. Shen Yuan recognizes that it is a better cell than the prison that awaits the scum villain in the future. He has a bed and a table, and a few forgotten books that Shen Qingqiu hasn't bothered to collect.</p><p>“You will stay here,” he orders. “You not only have my body, but also my cultivation level. You don't need to eat, congrats.”</p><p>A moment earlier, Shen Qingqiu had examined his spirit veins to determine his level. The verdict had been that they were both insultingly identical. The scum villain hadn't liked finding out.</p><p>Shen Yuan doesn't want to be locked in a tiny room for days or maybe months, but he doesn't protest. He intuits that Shen Qingqiu is in a horrible mood and is still better than the future written in the book. Shen Yuan clings to that idea to accept his situation with resignation.</p><p>Ironically, it is better to be a prisoner of the villain than of the protagonist. Thinking of PIDW, Shen Yuan feels fear scratching at his heart. He cannot tell the truth to Shen Qingqiu. The scum villain is a cruel and selfish person, a lot of people are going to die because of him! His disciples, his martial brothers... If Shen Qingqiu discovers it, he is capable of sacrificing him when Luo Binghe returns thirsty for revenge. After all, the two are identical.</p><p>Shen Yuan refuses to pay for someone else's crimes when he has been trying to save Luo Binghe all this time.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu finishes charming the room and stops in front of him. His gaze is sharp and Shen Yuan shrinks, uncomfortable.</p><p>“You’re a pathetic copy,” he says, clicking his tongue. “Did someone suspect you?”</p><p>Shen Yuan shallows.</p><p>“I tried to avoid the other Peak Lords,” he explains. “I haven't seen most of them. Liu Qingge, for example, I first met him at Lingxi Caves. Yue Qingyuan and Mu Qingfang were the only ones who were with me when I <em> qi deviated. </em>” Shen Yuan lifts two fingers, wagging invisible quotations.</p><p>“Did they suspect something?” He insists, his gaze is even darker.</p><p>“I think not...” Shen Yuan is insecure, but he needs to regain the scum villain's trust to gain enough power to alter the plot. “I kept my distance and tried to act like you. During all this time I was only with the disciples and then three years in seclusion. I have supplanted you for a very short time! And I successfully defeated a demon!”</p><p>However, something he has said has caused Shen Qingqiu to clench his teeth hard. Shen Yuan is speechless and terrified. Although Shen Qingqiu is quiet, he is surrounded by a murderous rage.</p><p>“Tell me everything you did when you were in my body. Absolutely all the details,” he demands and Shen Yuan doesn't dare lie to him.</p><p>He tells him that he woke up in his bed accompanied by Yue Qingyuan, how Mu Qingfang explained that it had been a deviation of qi and that perhaps his memories were blurred, how he rescued Luo Binghe from bullies and the skinners’ mission. How he decided to go into seclusion to get used to his body and how he saved Liu Qingge's life. What he cannot explain is why they then separated into two.</p><p>His words make Shen Qingqiu growl and hiss in disgust or roll his eyes.</p><p>Shen Yuan thinks he has done a good job, and yet Shen Qingqiu seems increasingly furious.</p><p>“Did you allow a lesser demon to trap you?” Shen Qingqiu looks at him with a menacing rage. “You would have destroyed my reputation if I hadn't...”</p><p>Fortunately for Shen Yuan, Shen Qingqiu falls silent upon hearing someone call the bamboo house. The scum villain frowns before giving him a silent warning and leaving the room. Shen Yuan nods. He is not stupid enough to challenge him. Curious, he approaches the door and hears the calm voice of Yue Qingyuan confronting the poisonous Shen Qingqiu. <em> Poor Yue Qingyuan, </em>he regrets. It is not his fault that Shen Qingqiu is pissed off and turns his worry into excuses to insult him. Shen Yuan clenches his fists.</p><p>Despite everything, he still wants to change the end of the book. He wants to protect those children whom he has grown attached to and Yue Qingyuan, too kind for such a horrifying ending.</p><p>It has been a tiring day and exhaustion traps Shen Yuan without being able to resist. He crawls into bed and is already asleep when he collapses.</p><p>Shen Yuan walks through the mists.</p><p>It is confusing at first. He doesn't know where he is or what happened. He walks through an unfocused landscape. For a few seconds, Shen Yuan wonders if Shen Qingqiu has drugged him. Until the system explains that he is in the arc of the dream demon.</p><p>That makes no sense. Where is Ning Yingying? For Shen Yuan to replace Luo Binghe's childhood friend is as absurd as having become Shen Qingqiu's clone. He definitely hates PIDW's pointless plots.</p><p>A confused and scared Luo Binghe appears out of nowhere and runs to hug him.</p><p>“Shizun!” He cries. “Where are we?”</p><p><em> In a ruined wife plot, </em> he sighs. <em> In one of the plots that will change your life forever. </em></p><p>Shen Yuan looks at the boy with the suspicion that Shen Qingqiu threw him into danger without congratulating him afterward. And now he has a chance to fix it. Shen Yuan smiles as he pets Luo Binghe's head.</p><p>“This teacher couldn't tell Binghe before how proud he is of him,” he says. “You did it very well.”</p><p>His disciple bows his head, his cheeks flushed, and his eyes bright with happiness.</p><p>“Thanks, shizun.”</p><p>“I’m sorry,” he adds. “I hope Binghe didn't feel ignored. This master had to leave early to check the sect's security.”</p><p>“This disciple understands it!”</p><p><em> Binghe, </em> he sighs, still smiling. <em> You are an adorable white lotus. </em></p><p>Shen Yuan doesn’t like to act so that Shen Qingqiu will later take the credit and also insult and scold him as if he were useless. And at the same time, this opportunity tastes like victory. He grins. It's too early to give up.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>That night Shen Jiu had no intention of sleeping.</p><p>He finds that sorting out the paperwork helps him to calm down. Because range bubbles in his chest until he is breathless. It’s painful. His emotions freeze his bones and heart, it clouds his mind. His hands shake when he picks up a manual. Shen Jiu takes a deep breath. But his discomfort doesn’t disappear.</p><p>Yue Qingyuan hasn't noticed. Yue Qingyuan, precisely Yue Qingyuan, didn‘t realize that he had been impersonated.</p><p>It hurts.</p><p>He can understand that Mu Qingfang and his other martial brothers didn’t suspect anything (he has always kept their distance from them) or that his disciples were fooled (they are little children), but Shen Jiu cannot accept that Yue Qingyan was misled.</p><p>His room is just as he remembered it, the usurper hasn’t sullied it. Shen Jiu sits in front of the table and considers possible strategies to extract the truth from him. Leaving him alive is dangerous, but Shen Yuan is not stupid and will surely keep secrets to ensure his safety.</p><p>Perhaps a poison could serve to interrogate him, however, Shen Jiu hasn’t forgotten the threat of death that surrounds Shen Yuan. He must first understand who he really is and how he got into his body. Then who forces him to meet certain events and why. Third, what about Luo Binghe. And, finally, his future.</p><p>Shen Jiu is thinking when the bamboo house door is opened without permission and the boy he hates goes into a panic attack.</p><p>“Shizun!” He yells with wet eyes.</p><p>“Luo Binghe,” he hisses, standing up. “What are you doing here?”</p><p>Realizing his mistake, Luo Binghe backs off. He is shaking when he bows.</p><p>“This disciple wanted to make sure that Shizun was fine.”</p><p>Shen Jiu raises an eyebrow as he crosses his arms.</p><p>“Do you doubt your master’s safety?” Although he interrogates him coldly, his thoughts fly away.</p><p>Shen Jiu deduces that Luo Binghe has just woken up from the dream induced by that demon Shen Yuan told him about. <em> Another unexpected victory </em>, he thinks bitterly. That brat is small and insignificant, and yet in a very short time, he has defeated two powerful demons. Shen Jiu wants to tear him apart and sink him into the same mud of misery that covers him. Shen Jiu wants to take advantage of his abilities for his benefit.</p><p>And he still doesn't know which of the two possibilities tempts him the most.</p><p>“Leave,” he growls. “And never again enter my house without permission or I will rip the skin off your back.”</p><p>“Yes, shizun,” he murmurs.</p><p>Finally alone, Shen Jiu sits down and sighs as he massages his temples. He is tired, angry, and frustrated.</p><p>That night he couldn't sleep.</p>

<p>
<span>After a sleepless night tainted with corrupted feelings, Shen Jiu is in a horrible mood. He sternly announces to his disciples that the next one who enters the bamboo house without warning will be punished. His gaze is fixed on Luo Binghe. He is too busy fixing three lost years and he doesn’t have time to punish him for his last night’s insolence, setting an example for the others.</span>
</p><p>
<span>However, Luo Binghe it’s not the first one who bothers him that morning, but Liu Qingge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The War Gor comes unannounced. Shen Jiu grits his teeth as he recognizes that arrogant white-clothed figure walking up to his peak as if it belonged to him. His self-confidence is irritating and he forgets his disciples to intercept him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you doing here?” He hisses, tapping the fan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge stops and stares at him like this is the first time. His silence is awkward. Shen Jiu glares at him, waiting for a delayed reply. Liu Qingge frowns when he extends an arm as if he is going to hit him. Shen Jiu is already prepared to defend himself when he sees that he is offering him a fan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” He sighs without hiding his irritation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“For you,” Liu Qingge mutters. He has looked away and is as rigid as if they were going to fight. But instead of a sword, he brandishes a white and green fan, with red decorations.</span>
</p><p>
<span>
<img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/8594b61d85c2f763f50131b4b763ff8b/ba6fb271f9e74067-f4/s2048x3072/4bc1ad9583d39a71b9e6297c7135e771cbbfeafc.jpg" alt width="848" height="619" />
</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu is not used to gifts and that’s why he doesn’t recognize one.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Restless, he leans over to examine that unfamiliar fan without understanding why he is offering it to him nor why Liu Qingge is getting more and more nervous. He seems about to break something, maybe the fan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not mine,” he says, hiding behind his. “Did you find it? Perhaps some idiot has lost it...”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>An idiot named Shen Yuan, </span>
</em>
<span>he thinks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Now it's yours!” Shen Jiu still doesn't understand him and Liu Qingge huffs, tense and uncomfortable. “For saving me!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu still hasn't accepted the fan, so Liu Qingge stretches out his arm until he has no choice but to pick it up. When he holds it in his hand, Liu Qingge turns and draws Cheng Luan. In an instant, he flies away and disappears over the horizon.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Shen Jiu stands still, confused, and with his first gift in his hand. He looks at the fan, hoping to find a catch, not a fancy design. It is an expensive fan, typical of a brat like Liu Qingge. Shen Jiu growls as a poisonous thought slides through his mind like a snake. </span>
<em>
<span>When I saved your life, you accused me of attacking you from behind but now you thank Shen Yuan with a present.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>He returns to the bamboo house with stiff steps. After opening the door with a sharp bang, Shen Jiu heads to the second room. Shen Yuan has kept his word (for the moment) and he still hasn't come out. The usurper is trying to ruffle his hair and looks at him in surprise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you need something…?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“For you.” Shen Jiu throws the fan at him and he catches it without blinking. “It seems like Liu Qingge is very grateful for saving his life. And that you told the truth again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course! Why would I have lied to you?” Shen Yuan protests, his lips pursed in an offended grimace. Then he opens the fan. “It’s cute.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“All yours. I don't want you to keep stealing my life and my belongings.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan bows his head, almost guiltily. </span>
<em>
<span>Too late, </span>
</em>
<span>he thinks. Shen Jiun hums uneasy before leaving and slamming the door. He needs to evaluate the progress of his disciples during those three years. He needs to make sure the usurper hasn't destroyed his life and extract the truth from him. He needs to investigate if there have been any other strange occurrences. He needs to investigate the demonic invasion as well. He has so many things to do that anxiety drowns him out. And if that's not enough, a Qiong Ding Peak disciple appears to warn him that all Peak Lords have an urgent meeting at noon.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His head hurts like it's going to explode. Insomnia and stress have merged into a vague pain. Shen Jiu needs all of his willpower to maintain his aloof facade.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before going to Qiong Ding Peak, he returns to Shen Yuan's room without actually entering. From the door, Shen Jiu gazes at the usurper.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What do you know about the demonic invasion?” He asks. “Is suspicious that they attacked when all the Peak Lords were busy. And they also knew how to get around our defenses.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu has not yet ruled out the possibility that Shen Yuan was in league with Sha Hualing. And he doesn't respond. Shen Yuan ponders his answer too carefully, which betrays him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know something,” Shen Jiu understands with a hiss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan doesn’t deny it. He lifts his head and looks directly into his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, but it’s that kind of information that I can't tell.” He pauses another pause before continuing talking. “I could try to find a risky way to tell you, but what do I get?”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Really? </span>
</em>
<span>Shen Jiu looks at him in disbelief. Is that brat blackmailing him? After everything he's done? Prepotent! He squeezes his fan so hard his knuckles turn white.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Remember why you are still alive.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And then what? Do you want me to stay here forever while I answer your questions? I'm not a bird!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu narrows his eyes. He would keep arguing with him if it weren't because he's going to be late for the meeting. And he knows it. Perhaps he has sought out Shen Yuan because he needed an excuse to delay an inevitable moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He slams the door shut again and takes a deep breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It is time to face his eleven martial brothers, that group of hypocrites who didn’t recognize the difference between the two of them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu flies on his sword. He is among the last to reach Qiong Ding Peak, shortly before Liu Qingge. He walks quickly to avoid coinciding with the War God because if he listens to him perhaps he will lose his patience and the words will slip out of him. Shen Jiu decides to ignore him despite his visible attempts to attract his attention. Liu Qingge ends up giving up and the two of them sit in their place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Being so close to Yue Qingyuan is painful. Shen Jiu ignores him too, and his sad looks, his kind courtesy. Shen Jiu stands firm and composed like a statue, even though his disappointment is cracking his patched heart.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The meeting is as terrible as he imagined.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Everyone speaks at the same time and no one has clear ideas. Shen Jiu doesn’t participate despite hiding a suspicion called Shen Yuan and having been one who witnessed the invasion. He doesn't talk about his theories either. Shen Jiu remains silent and thinks about everything he will do when he returns to his peak. And if he should take care of Luo Binghe. He senses that there is something strange about this child, but perhaps it is his prejudices or that he desperately needs an excuse to justify his jealousy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Unfortunately, the meeting ends with no results and Yue Qingyuan determines that they will meet again that afternoon. They've wasted hours yelling at each other and have yet to talk about beefing up security or investigating rumors.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu is furious when he leaves.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan has spent that morning thinking of strategies to negotiate with the scum villain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He is not dumb and knows that he shouldn’t provoke him, but Shen Qingqiu has already destroyed the plot once. It would be naive to believe that with a couple of indications everything will end well. No, he needs to interfere more directly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan knows two things: first, he has Shen Qingqiu's interest. Second, he has demonstrated that he has told the truth. </span>
<em>
<span>I have to convince him to let me take care of Luo Binghe, </span>
</em>
<span>he thinks. </span>
<em>
<span>But how? </span>
</em>
<span>Unveiling his ideas so early is too risky. Perhaps he should start with tiny deals: information in exchange for small freedoms like access to bestiaries. The Immortal Alliance is still several years away. Shen Yuan clings to that fact to reinforce his hope and optimism.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The talismans prevent anyone outside the house from hearing him, but they don’t prevent him from hearing the noises outside. Shen Yuan sighs sadly. The disciples practice music and sometimes he hears a child cry. He misses those kids.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan stiffens when the door of the house opens. Shen Qingqiu has returned. He listens to his footsteps, tense and expectant with a mixture of fear and urges for Shen Qingqiu to open the door of his room. He hates that horrible character, but he is also the only person he can talk to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu ignores him and Shen Yuan sighs again before picking up one of the few books in the room. He is so bored that he appreciates any reading.</span>
</p><p>
<span>An hour later, Shen Qingqiu enters his room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan sits up. He has a proposal on his tongue, however, Shen Qingqiu overtakes him with his brusque gestures and sharp voice, with those gazes that demand silence and his arrogant words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have a deal for you,” and he says it in a way that warns that Shen Yuan won't be able to refuse. “Do you want to go outside? Fine. I'll test you.“</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan frowns but doesn't protest. It wasn’t in his plans for Shen Qingqiu to be open to bargains. This is excellent news and he clings to that possibility, hiding his feelings from him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What kind of test?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There is a Peaks Lords’ meeting this afternoon and I don't want to waste my time. You will go in my place. This is your chance to show me that you are a good substitute.” Shen Jiu approaches, ominously. “If you fail, you'll be locked in here until I consider it. If you do it right, I'll rethink letting you out. With my conditions, of course.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As expected of the villain, Shen Qingqiu is a horrible manipulator. Shen Yuan clenches his fists, but nods. This is his best chance to change the future. And he still has information to negotiate with later. For the moment, Shen Yuan decides to focus on the task of being a good actor. They two have the same face. It’s quite logical that everyone will mistake him for Shen Qingqiu.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan decides that he will be a better Shen Qingqiu.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come, your hair is a mess,” the real Shen Qingqiu growls and Shen Yuan meekly follows his directions.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu refuses to give him Xiu Ya, so Shen Yuan will have to go on foot. Although he loves to fly with a sword, at that moment walking seems wonderful to him. Shen Yuan doesn't know when he will get another chance, so he walks slowly up Qing Jing Peak and greets all of his children. Then he heads to Rainbow Bridge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Bai Zhan Peak is close to Qing Jing Peak and so he is not surprised when Liu Qingge lands in front of him, Cheng Luan in his hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you doing? You are going to be late.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan doesn’t want to be unfriendly to a person he hardly knows, but he must act out his role. However, due to his lack of experience, he cannot think of any answer worthy of Shen Qingqiu, so he hides behind the fan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not your business.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge's eyes widen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You're using my... you're using it,” he sputters before clearing his throat.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Yeah, it’s cute and I don’t have another one, </span>
</em>
<span>he thinks. But he is now Shen Qingqiu and he shouldn't show any hint of sympathy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course, or did you want me not to use it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn't think you would use it!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So why did shidi give it to me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge is visibly nervous and Shen Yuan is sorry for him. He can imagine that Shen Qingqiu hasn't exactly kindly accepted his gift. Liu Qingge’s reaction is normal, not his. Shen Yuan sighs before turning his back on him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It will be late, don't distract me.” Shen Yuan tries to drench his words with all the arrogance he can. It’s frustrating. He hasn't unlocked OOC mode to be cocky again!</span>
</p><p>
<span>He hears muffled noises behind his back, but he doesn't turn around. </span>
<em>
<span>And all because Shen Qingqiu hasn’t wanted to leave me his sword, </span>
</em>
<span>he grumbles. </span>
<em>
<span>He is the one objectively dangerous, he should be unarmed not me!</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan has become so distracted that he has not heard Liu Qingge jump onto his sword. However, instead of walking away, he flies up to his side.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I'll take you,” he says in a strangled murmur.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Wait! What? What are you doing Liu Qingge? We are enemies! </span>
</em>
<span>Shen Yuan has been paralyzed and Liu Qingge takes that opportunity to grab him and raise him to the sword. </span>
<em>
<span>Not! This is definitely OOC!</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Leave me!” He protests. His panic grows as the sword rises several feet into the air. “I want to walk! I don't care about that meeting!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan stumbled and almost tripped. Because moving on a sword is a very bad idea. A cry escapes him when he feels that he is going to fall, but Liu Qingge catches him in time in a hug that pushes him against his chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He quickly detaches himself as long as Cheng Luan's length allows.</span>
</p><p>
<span>
<img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/16dbc46b60d9d1f81089c84f0d3862b9/ba6fb271f9e74067-d6/s2048x3072/ab57312ab91dade24e844ed92ccaf9db82a7332b.jpg" alt width="848" height="619" />
</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don't be proud,” he mutters, a little flushed. “You helped me in the caves during the qi deviation and then you fought against those demons. Your cultivation has always been weak.” Shen Yuan looks at him without understanding what he means. “It is understandable that you are tired.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ah…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He never... has thought about it. The real causes behind Liu Qingge's death are never mentioned in the book. If Shen Yuan had been less lucky, he too would have mistakenly killed him. Or he would have been killed. Being written from Luo Binghe's POV, the demonic invasion is another scene where Shen Qingqiu mistreats him, however, Shen Qingqiu is saving the sect after having survived the murderous qi deviation of one of the more powerful cultivators. Perhaps Shen Qingqiu in the book also chose Luo Binghe because he needed his talent to protect the sect?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Maybe he hoped Liu Mingyan would win, but when she lost he was cornered. And he made the most logical decision since there were only disciples left. The other Peak Lords were either far or dead.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As a scum villain, the book says that Shen Qingqiu's cultivation is only as mediocre as his personality. Even so, Shen Qingqiu managed to overcome various setbacks without ever losing his proud appearance from Luo Binghe's eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan begins to feel uncomfortable. He shakes his head to push those thoughts away. It’s irrelevant. They have changed the book, those scenes haven’t happened, and the real Shen Qingqiu is a horrible person. His assumptions are useless in this present.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Too late he discovers that Liu Qingge is carrying him in his sword without him being able to prevent it. </span>
<em>
<span>Shen Qingqiu, don't kill me! </span>
</em>
<span>He cries. </span>
<em>
<span>He's being OOC, not me! </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine,” he nods, hiding behind the fan. “Don't let anyone see us. Or I will kill you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu has threatened him so many times like this that Shen Yuan can perfectly imitate him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge nods with a grunt.</span>

<span>Luo Binghe intercepts him when Shen Jiu walks through Qing Jing Peak.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Besides bothering him, the boy has done nothing wrong so he can’t punish him. Luo Binghe respectfully bows and says if he can ask him something. Shen Jiu has no reason to refuse, so he clicks his tongue and crosses his arms while waiting for Luo Binghe to speak.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shizun,” he mutters, his voice as polite as uncertain. “Is it true that all demons are evil?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu huffs and a wry smile spread across his face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Only someone like you would ask such a naive question! Don't be silly, Luo Binghe, humans can be worse than demons.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And with a flick of his sleeve, Shen Jiu continues without paying any more attention to his disciple. If he had looked at him one last time, he would have discovered that Luo Binghe is smiling and peculiar happiness shines in his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>To check if Shen Yuan imitated him correctly yesterday, Shen Jiu plans to meet some of his martial brothers today. If any of them comment that yesterday he acted strangely, Shen Yuan will have failed the test. If not... it is not a guarantee that he approved it, but he will value it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>First, Shen Jiu visits An Ding Peak. Shang Qinghua trembles like a hamster when he sees him. That shaky little man is a Peak Lord parody. Shen Jiu hates him. It is frustrating that someone so weak and useless has reached the same goal as him without all his effort. Shen Jiu sighs and tries to ignore those envious thoughts. Although he tries to control them, those last days are torturing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wasn't expecting you. Do you need my help, Shen-shixiong?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I plan to remodel my house.” He says, staring at him very intently to watch his reaction. “I'm going to change some furniture. I also have a disused room that I want to convert into a second bedroom.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shang Qinghua frowns.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can I ask why?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Perhaps it is because of the terror he feels for him, but Shang Qinghua agrees to all his requests and doesn’t comment anything about his sudden personality changes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His next stop is Qian Cao Peak. Shen Jiu approaches Mu Qingfang to inform him that he has recovered his memories and to question him about his </span>
<em>
<span>qi deviation</span>
</em>
<span>. His martial brother acts as the responsible healer that he is. He gives him a quick check-up and also asks him a few questions about his health. His verdict: he is back as before the incident.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That is obvious and logical because someone was impersonating him and now he is the same Shen Qingqiu as always.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu knows that he must visit Yue Qingyuan, but he ends up postponing the meeting. So, he stops at Xian Shu Peak to annoy Qi Qingqi and remind her that her wonderful disciple lost to a lesser demoness. The relationship between the two is dire and they take every opportunity to stab each other with insults. When he leaves Xian Shu Peak, Shen Jiu feels a little more relaxed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His heart beats fast as he assumes that he must head for Qiong Ding Peak. Every step hurts, his thoughts spin out of control again. All the hatred that he hides in his chest spreads through his body like second veins that engulf him. Shen Jiu's lungs breathe anger, discouragement, frustration, and envy. Although he tries to control himself, in the end, he stops in front of Yue Qingyuan's door without daring to enter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After sighing, Shen Jiu rides on his sword and returns to Qing Jing Peak. He should talk to Yue Qingyuan another day, one in which he has locked up all of those feelings or, at least, they have cooled down. He should order his ideas to avoid losing control when he looks into his eyes and knows that he has failed him again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan is an interesting mystery that allows him to get distracted. After ordering his disciples to run fifty laps around Qing Jing Peak, he returns to Shen Yuan intending to rearrange the house.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Neither Shang Qinghua, Mu Qingfang, nor Qi Qingqi has mentioned anything, so for now, Shen Jiu is giving Shen Yuan a chance. And if he wants to keep his clone alive, he must adapt his bamboo house to a second person.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan perhaps recognizes that he is in a bad mood because he doesn’t ask any questions and follows all his directions. Shen Jiu mentally organizes how he will change the furniture and what he needs to order from An Ding Peak later.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although it's heavy work, Shen Jiu manages to stay distracted enough to calm down as the hours go by. At the end of the day, he is too preoccupied with how to keep Shen Yuan hidden from the rest of the sect to still think about Yue Qingyuan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A week later, the bamboo house is adapted for the two of them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Living with Shen Yuan is as annoying as doing it with someone else. Shen Jiu appreciates tranquility, silence, and solitude. The usurper has also stolen that privilege. However, over time he discovers that Shen Yuan can quietly spend hours reading. So he ends up looking for several bestiaries for him after Shen Yuan promises not to bother him. And maybe it's because he has the same body and face, but Shen Jiu doesn't feel any threat. Or perhaps because time has finally erased the anguish of being surrounded by other men after the Qiu mansion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan's second test comes when Yue Qingyuan calls Liu Qingge, Mu Qingfang, and him on a mission.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tonight I'm taking Ming Fan on a night hunt,” he explains while entering the bamboo house. Shen Yuan is in his room and looks out, without crossing the door, when he hears him. “Do you know if something will happen?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan frowns.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You guys do a lot of night hunts, I need more details. Who accompanies you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mu Qingfang, Liu Qingge, and their disciples.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan nods while thinking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not sure. At least, I guess nothing important will happen because then I’d remember it. I think it will be an irrelevant night hunt.” Shen Yuan bites his lip, a gesture Shen Jiu hates, and looks at him like he always does when he wants to say something but doesn't dare.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So?” Shen Jiu demands impatiently, closing his fan in a sharp blow that startles him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Perhaps you should take Luo Binghe with you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu narrows his eyes. He knows there is something fishy about that boy, but Shen Yuan dodges all his questions.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He defeated a demon elder. His level is better than Ming Fan...”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ming Fan is my head disciple,” he remembers. “Luo Binghe may be a good fighter, but we are at Qing Jing Peak, not at Bai Zhan Peak. That kid is a mess who needs to perfect all four arts.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Like so many times, Shen Yuan lowers his head and doesn’t add more, in a gesture that Shen Jiu already recognizes: he is hiding something. Their discussions are brief and always end with Shen Yuan silencing his opinions, either out of fear or mistrust.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu doesn't care about his reasons. It’s proof that the usurper is not stupid, but is making it difficult to question him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Remember the rules,” he says before leaving.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Followed by Ming Fan, Shen Jiu meets his martial brothers at the sect's entrance. They will go on horseback and don’t need much preparation, it’s just a beast attacking a nearby forest. As Shen Jiu gives his disciple some final indications, he discovers that Liu Qingge is watching him. When he turns to growl at him, Liu Qingge abruptly turns his back and rides his horse. </span>
<em>
<span>Strange, </span>
</em>
<span>he thinks, suspiciously.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The ride is uneventful despite the rivalry between Qing Jing Peak and Bai Zhan Peak. Shen Jiu notices the tension between their disciples, but he has no patience to put up with their trifles, so he hisses until Ming Fan finds it wiser to ignore them and follow his teacher. To Shen Jiu's surprise, Liu Qingge also orders his disciples to shut up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The rest of the trip is peaceful.</span>
</p><p>
<span>While Mu Qingfang and his kids stay in the rear, Liu Qingge guides his two disciples against the monster. It is an Ankylosing Snake with Eight Barbs. Shen Jiu and Ming Fan help the Bai Zhan Peak. It is a team mission, in which they combine skill with the sword and knowledge, however, they lack experience in fighting together. Although Liu Qingge is acting strangely assertive tonight, his disciples are brusque and reject any help. Ming Fan doesn’t act better either: he is proud and ignores Shen Jiu's prompts to prove that he is more capable than the brutes of Bai Zhan Peak.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It's no surprise that Yue Qingyuan sent Mu Qingfang as well. His disciples seem very happy about all the practice they will have later in healing wounds.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu has read about this creature and knows that its barbs can explode into poison when it’s cornered. That is why you have to kill it quickly and not the slow torture of three stupid teenagers armed with swords. Knowing this, Shen Jiu keeps an eye on Ankylosing Snake with Eight Barbs' attitude.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A bluish glow betrays the moment of its counterattack.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Back off!” He yells, grabbing Ming Fan by the neck of the robe to push him away. “It’s going to expel poison!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Is it worth being poisoned in exchange for kicking the War God? Yes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu uses his talismans to push the rest of the children away from danger and knocks Liu Qingge out of the way with a satisfying kick. The poison hits him and Shen Jiu coughs as he covers his face with a sleeve. Since he's already poisoned, he doesn't mind charging forward. He lunges at the monster holding his breath and decapitates it with an accurate blow from Xiu Ya.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then he backs off before inhaling too much poison. He is not an idiot.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shizun!” Ming Fan runs towards him half crying half screaming. “Are you okay? That’s been awesome!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hum.” Shen Jiu cleans his sword before sheathing it. Mu Qingfang's children have surrounded them to examine all the wounds. There are a few scratches and claws, even Ming Fan has a bloody leg. “Go get examined. And then we'll talk. I expected another attitude from you, Ming Fang.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His disciple bows his head, embarrassed, and shuffles over to one of the healing girls. Shen Jiu sighs and sudden dizziness assails him. He has taken a risk because he knows the venom of the Ankylosing Snake with Eight Barbs is not lethal, just annoying. Shen Jiu massages his temples in hope of easing his headache, although it will probably get worse throughout the night.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jerky steps approach him and Shen Jiu rolls his eyes before extending his fan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not now, Liu-shidi,” he groans before turning and facing Liu Qingge's disheveled face. Shen Jiu expected to see him offended and upset, probably to challenge him to a fight to regain his pride, however, Liu Qingge looks at him with wide eyes and astonishment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you… save me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I hit you for pleasure.” Shen Qingqiu smiles behind the fan even though his vision begins to be blurry. “It was quite delightful.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge makes a strangled sound and doesn't add anything else, so Shen Qingqiu takes the opportunity to walk away. It's strange. He has beaten Liu Qingge many, many times, but it is the first time that he is speechless or in the mood for more fights. Shen Jiu isn't going to complain either.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After two steps, he feels like he is losing his balance. Shen Jiu grits his teeth and rushes to his horse. On his mount, he feels more secure and can maintain his facade. Shen Jiu doesn't care that others think he's arrogant and cold, he's already played his part and he deserves a break. And maybe he does act impatient and is frustrated that it takes so long to heal the kids, but he's tired and the poison is spreading through his body. He needs to go home and sleep.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Without Shen Qingqiu, Shen Yuan feels like when his parents left one night and he had the house to himself. Of course, he doesn't dare to break any rules. And, although the temptation is immense, he stays inside reading one of the bestiaries that Shen Qingqiu has brought him. Shen Yuan acknowledges that PIDW's worldbuilding is amazing. And the bestiaries have a lot of information that doesn't appear in the book!</span>
</p><p>
<span>The night progresses and Shen Yuan recovers one of his worst habits: forgetting about sleep and reading for hours.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He is startled when the door is open.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although he knows that he hasn’t done anything explicitly forbidden, Shen Yuan quickly closes the book and tries to blow out the candles without starting a fire. Shen Qingqiu loves complaining about everything he does and he senses that this disaster (the messy room, his hair down) will only annoy him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Of course, an angry Shen Qingqiu walks into his room. However, there is something strange about him: his steps are wobbly, his gaze is unfocused…</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry,” Shen Yuan babbles. “I've been distracted reading and… Are you alright?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s Luo Binghe, right?” He hisses. Shen Qingqiu points a hand at him so sharply that he staggers and needs to hold on to the wall. “You didn't know what was going to happen. Because you only know the future that concerns that brat, am I right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan swallows hard. He has seen Shen Qingqiu angry many times, but never so out of control. At that moment he can't think of any coherent lie. Because yes, PIDW is the story of Luo Binghe and all the adventures are told from his point of view.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fortunately, whatever affected Shen Jiu also stops him from murdering him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” Shen Yuan decides to admit the truth because these days he has found that Shen Qingqiu reacts positively every time he confirms that he has not lied to him. Besides, it no longer makes sense to hide it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why? What makes that child so special?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t answer that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu growls. Fortunately for Shen Yuan, at that moment someone opens the door of the bamboo house without permission. Shen Qingqiu's eyes widened in panic. Luckily the talismans have prevented others from hearing their discussion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Liu-shidi, don't be so brusque. Shen-shixiong may be resting," says Mu Qingfang's calm voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu has paled. Quickly, he grabs Shen Yuan and shoves him out of the room as he closes himself inside. When Shen Yuan realizes it, he finds himself stunned in the middle of the bamboo house watching Mu Qingfang and Liu Qingge enter.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Fuck. FUCK. </span>
</em>
<span>He needs a fan to hide his confused face. Although it is not the first time he impersonates Shen Qingqiu, it is not the same to have him so close, judging him. And Liu Qingge in front of him acting OOC again! </span>
<em>
<span>What are you doing at our house, Liu-shidi?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>As Shen Yuan hurries to pick up a fan, Liu Qingge blushes at the sight of his pristine martial brother with his hair down and his outer robe removed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Shen Yuan faces them, he notices their discomfort. Well, he's not going to apologize for his looks. A few moments earlier he was reading very comfortably and Shen Qingqiu has not given him time to clean himself up, so it is their fault, not his.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can I help my shidis?” He says in the coldest and most arrogant voice he can do despite his nervousness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Liu-shidi told me you have been in contact with the poison of Ankylosing Snake with Eight Barbs.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Wait, is that the reason why Shen Qingqiu is acting strange? Damn you Airplane, this doesn’t appear in the book! </span>
</em>
<span>Shen Yuan is very sure that after the Dream Demon Arc nothing exciting happens. However... It is evident that Shen Qingqiu wants to hide that he is poisoned. And from what he heard, Mu Qinfang has come at the insistence of Liu Qingge, who was killed in the book (and probably by now the other martial brothers would hate Shen Qingqiu for murdering Liu Qingge). So ... maybe it did happen but Luo Binghe never found out about this subplot?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan allows Mu Qingfang to examine him. Obviously, the doctor doesn’t discover anything strange, although he prescribes a week of rest just in case. He is the first to leave and the other two are left alone, both uncomfortable and without saying anything. Liu Qingge looks at the ground (he hasn’t dared to look at him for the last minutes) and his ears are a little red. Shen Yuan is fanning himself anxiously.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Liu-shidi...” He doubts. Acting like Shen Qingqiu is horrible! “If you enter my house again without warning and manners, I will kill you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge raises his head to look into his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanyouforsavingmylifeagain,” he splutters too fast for Shen Yuan to understand anything.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And he leaves. Without saying goodbye or closing the door. The War God disappears like a gale and Shen Yuan sighs in relief. Now he only has to deal with the most dangerous of all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu is sitting on his bed, gasping for air. His eyes are closed and his lips are deathly pale. Seeing him so affected fills Shen Yuan with the courage to stop hiding his opinions from him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was your brilliant plan?!” He scolds him. “You need a doctor! Now Mu Qingfang will believe that you are fine and will not give you any treatment. Or antidote. You are poisoned!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ankylosing Snake with Eight Barbs’ poison it’s just a nuisance,” he mutters with a hoarse voice.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Your personality is also a nuisance!</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“It's stupid. Aren't you supposed to be smarter than me? Don't endanger your health!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu opens his eyes with difficulty.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It's my health, not yours, does it matter?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course it matters! Your stupid pride will one day kill us both. Or the entire sect!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don't be exaggerated...”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As a regular reader of PIDW, Shen Yuan knows the ending of this story too well and how destructive Shen Qingqiu's pride will be. </span>
<em>
<span>If you didn't insist on hiding it, I would know this subplot. </span>
</em>
<span>He sighs as he rubs his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If I really was your enemy now I could kill you.” He warns him and for a few seconds, he sounds like the real Shen Qingqiu. “Do you understand now? You have to trust others.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu throws his head back and laughs. It is the first time Shen Yuan has heard him laugh. It’s creepy. It is not a villainous laugh like the one in the movies, but a dry, sarcastic laugh. When he calms down, Shen Qingqiu looks at him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you want to hear a story?” Shen Qingqiu continues without waiting for his reply. “When we were disciples, I once went with Liu Qingge and Shang Qinghua to hunt ghosts. Liu Qingge was worse than now, stupidly arrogant. He was so carefree that a ghost tried to attack him from behind. I killed it.” He added bitterly. “And do you know what he did? He accused me of trying to stab him in the back. And Mu Qingfang? For three years he has believed I have suffered a qi deviation that has altered my memories and personality! He didn't realize that he was talking to a different person.” Shen Qingqiu looked delusional, but after rubbing his eyes he regained his usual calm. “So no, I can't trust anyone but myself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan has listened to his story with discomfort. Of course, that doesn't show up in PIDW either. Maybe he's lied to him, he's the villain after all, but Shen Yuan has a feeling he's being more sincere than ever.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well,” he says, approaching him to help him get up and carry him to bed. “Now you will have to trust me. You don’t have any other choice.”</span>

<p>Shen Jiu wakes up dazed and with a slight fever. The poison has frozen his limbs. His joints ache when he tries to move as if they are rusted as if he has ice inside his bones. Shen Jiu sighs, exhausted and in pain, yet he still tries to get out of bed.</p><p>It is not the first time that he is in such a miserable state. As a wandering child, Shen Jiu knew hunger, cold, and extreme weakness. As a slave, Shen Jiu knew torture. As a disciple, Shen Jiu knew the limits of his own body.</p><p>In comparison, this is nothing.</p><p>Shen Yuan discovers him when he is trying to get dressed.</p><p>“What are you doing!?”</p><p>His scream pierces his head. Shen Jiu growls.</p><p>“Even if the talismans prevent others from hearing us, that doesn't mean you can scream.” He massages his temples. Even his voice sounds too high-pitched. It seems that the poison has also affected his perception of sound, <em> ideal </em>for being surrounded by lots of rowdy kids that morning.</p><p>“You aren’t thinking of going outside as if it is a normal day, are you?”</p><p>“Can you stop asking stupid questions for once?”</p><p>“You are sick!”</p><p>“Poisoned,” he corrects him.</p><p>“You are in a horrible state and you will surely end up yelling at him and punishing the children.” Shen Yuan looks terrified. Besides being exaggerating. “Today I will play as Shen Qingqiu.”</p><p>Shen Jiu snorts, almost amused by his audacity.</p><p>“So, are you going to try to impersonate me again by taking advantage of a moment of weakness?”</p><p>He drenches his words with resentment. However, Shen Yuan stares at him without being intimidated.</p><p>“Either you go to see Mu Qingfang so he can give you an antidote or you stay here resting while I take care of the children. Choose.”</p><p>Throughout his life, Shen Jiu has been beaten, locked up, ignored, wrongly accused... No one has cared about him, not really. Even his Qi-Ge's affection turned out to be fake. The prospect that someone else is trying to help him, even for selfish reasons, affects him more than poison.</p><p>“You can trust me,” Shen Yuan insists. “We are now in the same boat.”</p><p>“I will never trust you.”</p><p>“But you did.” Shen Yuan smiles victoriously. “Last night you trusted me to cover you in front of Mu Qingfang and Liu Qingge.”</p><p>In the next few minutes, their gazes meet in silence, arms crossed and the same stubbornness. They are like a mirror. Shen Jiu discovers that the two of them have chilling similarities. Despite his pride, Shen Jiu sighs as he sits on the bed.</p><p>“Fine,” he hisses. “Just for today. And erase that smile!”</p><p>He is already regretting it when, a while later, Shen Yuan leaves the bamboo house humming. Shen Jiu covers himself with the sheets and closes his eyes to force himself to sleep. At first, it's hard to rest while his thoughts revolve around Shen Yuan, his disciples, and everything that can go wrong. But he is too tired, his entire body aches as his qi fluctuates. Soon heavy darkness covers his head and he falls into a dreamless sleep.</p><p>When Shen Jiu wakes up, it is afternoon and someone has opened the door.</p><p>He stretches slowly, still dazed after so many hours of unconsciousness. Even when Shen Jiu hears Shen Yuan's cheerful voice, he still doesn't remember what happened.</p><p>Shen Yuan enters the bamboo house carrying a lot of scrolls, a smile lingering around the corners of his mouth. It‘s the first time Shen Jiu has seen him so happy and it makes him feel scared. Shen Jiu manages to sit upon the bed, still wrapped in the sheet, and rubs his eyes.</p><p>“What have you done?” He interrogates him when he is finally awake. Perhaps the poison has robbed him an entire day, but he doesn’t plan to give up so soon. Despite his dizziness, Shen Jiu leans forward as Shen Yuan sits across from him. “Music? Calligraphy?”</p><p>Shen Yuan shocks his head.</p><p>“I have taken them for a walk in the bamboo forest.” He explains. As soon as he hears him, Shen Jiu grimaces. “I thought you wouldn't want to be disturbed while trying to rest. So this morning we went for a walk. Then I asked them to write an essay on what has inspired them the most.”</p><p>“That’s… unorthodox.” Shen Jiu doesn't know yet if he dislikes that or not.</p><p>Shen Yuan keeps talking as he picks up the scrolls and puts them on the table.</p><p>“I have brought them to you. I guess you’d want to read them yourself.”</p><p>“You assumed well.”</p><p>Shen Jiu manages to get up, although he practically crawls down in front of the table. He hates his weakness. At least correcting his students' work will keep him entertained enough to stop feeling useless. After finishing his report, Shen Yuan goes to his room. However, he returns after picking up one of his bestiaries. Although they are sitting apart from each other, it is a different closeness than the previous days. The two ignore each other, concentrating on their readings.</p><p>Later, Shen Yuan asks for permission to leave.</p><p>“Why that?” Shen Jiu raises an eyebrow, suspicious. Shen Yuan was good that morning, too good even. He has been conscientious in the details and has chosen the option that Shen Jiu would like the most.</p><p>It is evident that he is planning something and he is trying to change his mind and then betray him.</p><p>However, Shen Yuan points a finger at him.</p><p>“You are weak and need to eat. And I’m hungry.”</p><p>Shen Jiu huffs, his gaze returning to his disciples' redactions.</p><p>“We've already talked about this: with your cultivation level, you don't need to eat as much. Anyway, go.”</p><p>Perhaps in recent days, they have shared more meals than Shen Jiu originally planned.</p><p>Shen Yuan smiles again, happy to have gotten away with it, before leaving the bamboo house. Of course, he flees fast, eager to escape those walls in which he has been locked for too long. Shen Jiu almost feels remorse. Almost.</p><p>Shen Yuan is slow to return. Shen Jiu thinks that he has lingered to savor his freedom, although he suspects that Shen Yuan is also plotting something. Shen Yuan carries a tray with a steaming pot and two bowls.</p><p>“No one has seen you, right?” Shen Jiu asks, pointing to the double utensils.</p><p>“Of course not!” Shen Yuan places the tray on the table while Shen Jiu collects the essays and puts them away. “We should keep more plates and chopsticks in the house...”</p><p>“You have some unusually good ideas today.” He changes his mind when he discovers that it is an unknown soup, with an abominable brown color and a powerful smell of licorice. “What’s that?”</p><p>“Licorice soup! I asked the disciples to try to make it, although I think it was their first time cooking something like that...” Shen Yuan's words lose confidence as he spreads the soup into the bowls. “I have read that licorice soup is good for treating an Ankylosing Snake with Eight Barbs poisoning.”</p><p>Shen Jiu's hands tremble when he picks up his bowl. Should he read Shen Yuan's bestiary first to make sure what he says is true? Perhaps he is trying to poison him by taking advantage of his weakness and has masked the poison with the smell and taste of licorice. But Shen Yuan is the first to taste the soup. Perhaps it is a specific poison? Or does he want to gain his trust to betray him later?</p><p>“Oh!” Shen Yuan's eyes sparkle. “It’s unexpectedly good!”</p><p>No, Shen Jiu doesn't believe it. Evidently, Shen Yuan wants to cajole him into trying that suspicious soup. Determined, he gets up and walks towards the bestiary. Shen Yuan has used a leaf to mark the page, so he immediately finds the section dedicated to the Ankylosing Snake with Eight Barbs. To his surprise, there is indeed an entry that talks about the properties of licorice soup.</p><p>When he turns around, he discovers that Shen Yuan is nervous. Too nervous. Shen Yuan looks away, but it is too late.</p><p>“You are hiding something from me,” Shen Jiu accuses him, his words as cold as threatening. “Don't take me for an idiot, Shen Yuan, it's humiliating.”</p><p>“Fine!” Shen Yuan sighs. And Shen Jiu waits with a tense heart and his gaze fixed on Xiu Ya just in case. “I asked Luo Binghe to make the soup.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Taste it first! Luo Binghe is your best cook, he is the only one who can make delicious licorice soup. And you need to take it.” He pauses. When he speaks again, he does so by lowering his head and slurring his words. “And you might stop disliking him if you taste his food.”</p><p>Shen Jiu knew that he was hiding something, but he didn't expect that answer. Instead of feeling victorious, Shen Jiu sits in front of the table still uncomfortable and stiff.</p><p>The soup is good.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Shen Qingqiu is still affected by the poison the next day and Shen Yuan manages to convince him to continue resting. He still can't believe it. Shen Yuan hates with all his will pretending to be Shen Qingqiu, but he has won two days of freedom. Two days to walk under the blue sky and enjoy the bamboo forest. Two days to surround himself with his dear disciples. Two days to continue working to change the future.</p><p>Right now, Shen Yuan thinks he's capable of anything.</p><p>That morning he takes the children to Qian Cao Peak. After greeting Mu Qingfang and apologizing for his sudden meddling, he asks him for favors. Despite his insecurity, the healer accepts all of his proposals and leads them to one of his orchards. Satisfied, Shen Yuan looks at his disciples, especially Luo Binghe. This lesson is very important, protagonist!</p><p>“There is a huge variety of poisonous monsters throughout the world,” he explains. His thoughts hopelessly think of the amount of sex pollen hidden in flowers, snakes, and even rivers. “In the Qing Jing Peak library you have at your disposal the best herbalists and bestiaries of the sect, however, it is useless if you read them without knowing how to identify the plants. With Mu-shidi's permission, today we are going to study medicinal plants. First, I will divide you into groups. Together you will try to identify the name of these plants and their properties.”</p><p>He joins Luo Binghe with Ning Yingying (Shen Yuan wants to improve the protagonist's relationship with his most special wife) and Ming Fan (perhaps if they become friends, Ming Fan will not die horribly in the future). Shen Yuan fans himself as he watches his disciples. As he discovered yesterday, teens love creative activities and they immediately start laughing and arguing.</p><p>After a while, he meets with Mu Qingfang to talk. It is vitally important to improve his relationship with the sect healer. And maybe Shen Yuan forgets to act unfriendly. He can't help it, the disciples have put him in a very good mood!</p><p>Shen Yuan brings the teens back together so that they can answer together. He tries to get everyone to participate and also corrects them patiently so that no one feels bad about failing.</p><p>“Now let's play a game,” Shen Yuan hides a smile behind his fan. ”This master will propose hypothetical situations and you will have to answer which of these plants is the best for each case, understood?”</p><p>All the teens' nod, eager, and with bright eyes. Luo Binghe is one of the most enthusiastic. That is good because Shen Yuan plans to use his prodigious memory to mention PIDW chapters in which Luo Binghe was in trouble. Especially the arcs related to Endless Abyss.</p><p>After a morning of fun learning and many spoilers, Shen Yuan leaves Qiong Ding Peak followed by his disciples like ducklings. Before reaching the Rainbow Bridge, Liu Qingge lands holding a child under each arm. He looks at him and Shen Yuan realizes too late that he is smiling. He can't help it, it's been a wonderful morning.</p><p>“Greetings, Liu-shidi,” he says, hiding behind the fan. Shen Yuan is not going to give Liu Qingge any more reasons to continue acting OOC.</p><p>Liu Qingge's gaze is fixed on Shen Yuan’s fan.</p><p>“I think your disciples are dying.”</p><p>Liu Qingge is startled, suddenly remembering that he is holding two children covered in bruises, blood, and grime. Without looking back at Shen Yuan, he quickly walks towards the main house on Qiong Ding Peak. In the distance, someone yells: "Liu Qingge is back!"</p><p>Shen Yuan laughs quietly before leading his disciples back to Qing Jing Peak.</p><p>As they eat, Shen Yuan explains to Shen Qingqiu what they have done today. Since he's sick, Shen Qingqiu seems less terrifying. Although Shen Yuan knows that this pause will be brief. <em> What a pity </em>, he laments. Shen Yuan is getting used to those days.</p><p>Although Shen Qingqiu watches him less suspiciously than yesterday, he still acts like one of those stray cats from his past life. Only instead of scratching him, he can pierce him with a sword.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>By the third day, Shen Jiu is well enough to return to his routine. Although Shen Yuan smiles, his disappointment is evident. For once, he doesn't blame him.</p><p>“I have arranged with Mu Qingfang that today we would take the disciples to Qian Cao Peak again.” Shen Yuan explains to him. Although Shen Jiu hates when someone else is trying to intervene in his routine, he agrees because perhaps his thoughts are acceptable. And Shen Jiu is still weak and without the patience to put up with noisy children, so it's not a bad idea to spread his responsibility with someone else. “They did it right yesterday, but most still have trouble putting the theory into practice.”</p><p>Shen Jiu nods. Unfortunately, he is aware that most of his disciples have more enthusiasm than skill.</p><p>Teens greet him like a bunch of chicks. Shen Jiu sighs before ordering them to walk after him quietly and in an orderly manner. It is inconceivable to him that all his disciples would forget their manners after two days of absence.</p><p>Mu Qingfang is waiting for him at the entrance to Qian Cao Peak. His martial brother smiles in a way that shocks Shen Jiu. It is the first time that the healer treats him with such familiarity. <em> Shen Yuan, </em> he thinks. <em> Stop messing with my life. </em></p><p>Mu Qingfang guides them to one of his orchards, hands behind his back, speaking very proudly of his collection of medicinal plants. </p><p>“Yesterday you worked with these,” he points to a small plot. “Your shizun and I think it would be good for you to take care of this garden a bit so that you become familiar with the herbs. We reached an agreement: if you work in the garden satisfactorily, you can make your sachet with medicinal plants.”</p><p>Although Shen Jiu has no idea, he nods with his face hidden behind the fan. The children are enthusiastic about the plan and they distribute the tasks quite effectively. Shen Jiu watches over them. Shen Yuan's ideas are strange, but they seem useful.</p><p>“Shen-shixiong,” Mu Qingfang says, holding out a hand for Shen Jiu to give his wrist so that he can examine it.</p><p>Later, when they return to Qing Jing Peak, Shen Jiu enters the bamboo house like a tornado. Shen Yuan is reading the disciples' essays and looks at him with a mixture of surprise and panic.</p><p>“You've tricked me!” Shen Qingqiu hisses. “You sent me to Qian Cao Peak for Mu Qingfang to check me even though I told you that I don't want others to know.”</p><p>Shen Yuan has the gall to blink in confusion.</p><p>“And that is bad? You need a doctor to confirm that you are cured and the poison will not leave you sequelae.” His voice fades to a whisper as Shen Jiu approaches him with furious steps.</p><p>Shen Yuan flinches when Shen Jiu closes his fan tightly.</p><p>“As a punishment...”</p>

<p>Shen Yuan gazes at the disciples, who are waiting expectantly for his shizun's indications. Luo Binghe's eyes are the brightest, followed by Ning Yingying and Ming Fan's.</p><p>He didn’t expect Shen Qingqiu's punishment to be taking care of the disciples that afternoon. Shen Yuan is still confused and a part of him thinks it is a trap. That decision is almost a kind gesture. If it were someone else, Shen Yuan would believe that Shen Qingqiu is thanking him. But it's impossible. Shen Qingqiu is probably not well yet and he doesn't feel like babysitting a bunch of screaming teenagers.</p><p>Shen Yuan forgets about the scum villain. He's not going to pass up another opportunity like this one. After gathering all the disciples in the library, Shen Yuan pedagogically tells them how to defeat some very particular monsters. Specifically, some of the worst that Luo Binghe will have to face in the Abyss.</p><p>His plan is a success. For most teenagers, it is just an interesting lesson, but Shen Yuan knows how to hide many specific clues that Luo Binghe will find very useful. He smiles behind his fan, happy as ever that he manages to outwit the plot of the story.</p><p>However, the lesson ends abruptly when they hear a noise outside and something hits the floor, making even the walls rumble. <em> WHAT THE FUCK </em> , he thinks. <em> System, what’s happening? </em> But the System is the worst villain of all and remains silent.</p><p>Shen Yuan misses Xiu Ya when he goes to the exit and tells the disciples to stay safe in the library. Luo Binghe decides to ignore his orders by stepping forward.</p><p>"Shizun, I want to help you!" He volunteers and Shen Yuan sighs.</p><p>The white lotus protagonist is too adorable.</p><p>Although it would be interesting to have the protagonist's halo (like in the skinner's mission), Shen Yuan prefers not to risk it. The threat that stalks them outside doesn’t appear in the book and he doesn’t want to put any of his disciples in danger.</p><p>Shen Yuan leaves the library. Despite his calm facade, he is shaking. Perhaps he should seek out the real Shen Qingqiu to deal with the threat himself. He has more experience and a damn sword. With increasingly slow steps, Shen Yuan exits.</p><p>Outside there is a horrible monster, dark green and covered with spikes.</p><p>It’s dead.</p><p>Shen Yuan stares at the corpse with wide eyes and a little apprehensive as he recognizes the pasty blood. Even more unusual than a monster on Qing Jing Peak is the pristine silhouette of Liu Qingge, who turns around after delivering his <em> package </em>and rides on his sword.</p><p><em> What happens to him? Liu Qingge stop being so OOC! </em>Shen Yuan is so shocked that he is not even scared at first. Then panic catches him like vines slipping under his skin, wrapping around his bones. Shen Yuan runs to the bamboo house and throws the door open. Shen Qingqiu is standing tense, his gaze piercing him as if he's to blame for all the disasters.</p><p>“What happened? I heard a strange noise.”</p><p>“Liu Qingge has brought you a monster. A dead monster.”</p><p>“He has done WHAT?” Shen Qingqiu opens his eyes, so dumbfounded that he forgets his rigid mannerisms.</p><p>Shen Yuan nods. As he begins to calm down, he realizes that Liu Qingge's attitude may not be as OOC as he had originally assumed.</p><p>“What if… it's a threat? You are rivals, right?” He muses. Liu Qingge giving them a fan it’s strange, not that he threw down a monster as some kind of silent warning. “Maybe you annoyed him on the last mission?”</p><p>Shen Qingqiu snorts.</p><p>“It was just a kick! And I saved him and his clumsy disciples!”</p><p><em> Wait! This is how you get poisoned? </em>Shen Yuan blinks, a little confused. He doesn’t expect to discover that hidden side of the villain. Although ... If Shen Qingqiu didn't lie to him, there was another time when he saved Liu Qingge but he was misunderstood. Shen Yuan doesn't know how to feel about that.</p><p>“Maybe you shouldn't have kicked him,” he gently scolds him. After all, it was in his plans to rely on the strength of the War God if in the future they had to face a blackened Luo Binghe. “Although Liu Qingge is being a bit ungrateful, honestly.”</p><p>Something similar to a smile appears on Shen Qingqiu's face.</p><p>“That’s right! He has always been like this,” he hisses, but his attitude is more satisfied than angry. “Even as disciples. He has never had manners and he comes from an illustrious family. I don't know what they taught him, but education certainly did not.” Shen Qingqiu rolls his eyes. “He insisted on always chasing me to challenge me to a duel. He once even entered the library and almost smashed a very delicate book with that sword of his.” Realizing that he had been carried away by the weight of memories, Shen Qingqiu cleared his throat. “What kind of monster has he brought? And please give me a detailed explanation.”</p><p>“A Smelly Swamp Lord.”</p><p>Shen Qingqiu looks at him with surprise before starting to fan himself.</p><p>“Well, It seems that you don’t read all those bestiaries in vain.” Shen Qingqiu rests the tip of the fan on his lips. “In Liu Qingge’s language it surely means that he is the best hunter, but a Smelly Swamp Lord is a very rare and valued monster. Although it’s stinky, its meat can help strengthen the cultivation.”</p><p>Shen Yuan's smile escapes as he shakes his head.</p><p>“Poor Liu-shidi, he has given us a gift by mistake.”</p><p>“Hmmnn, I will tell the disciples to cook it.” Shen Qingqiu heads for the door, marking the end of Shen Yuan's brief <em> punishment </em>. “We will take the remaining parts to Qian Cao Peak, sure that Mu Qingfang finds its usefulness.”</p><p>“Oh! Smelly Swamp Lord's liver is used to decontaminate water and his tongue is very useful for some pills and...”</p><p>Shen Yuan mutes when Shen Qingqiu gives him a curious look. With his face hidden behind the fan, it is impossible to tell if he is smiling or grunting.</p><p>“You are not as useless as you seemed.” He mutters to himself before leaving.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>During the process of dismembering Smelly Swamp Lord's body and cleaning the garden, Shen Jiu may have made a mistake. The monster that Liu Qingge has brought is immense and although he is not a kind or altruistic person, he decides to share the corpse in a banquet for all of his disciples and Shen Yuan as well. Luo Binghe is his best cook and Shen Jiu decides to entrust him with the main part of cooking the food. And that’s perhaps a mistake. Luo Binghe looks at him with an illusion comparable to all the stars in the world locked in his eyes. It’s awkward. And unpleasant.</p><p>Shen Jiu still doesn't like that boy and doesn't know what to do with him. Shen Yuan is convincing him to stop punishing him and Luo Binghe hasn't made any mistakes lately either, yet he still wants to keep as many distances as possible. And make a decision, now that he knows that Luo Binghe's fate is glorious.</p><p>Should he defy destiny? Or steal Luo Binghe’s future fame like he did during the demonic invasion? Shen Jiu has always hated being in the shadow of others. He has built his path to the top with sweat, blood, and tears.</p><p>While he decides... he is going to enjoy an unusually delicious feast, which mixes the exotic meat of a monster that cleanses his meridians and strengthens them with a garnish that melts on his palate. There is silence in the bamboo house. Shen Yuan and Shen Jiu savor their food. When Shen Yuan begins to praise Luo Binghe's culinary prowess, spiced up with gibberish that Shen Jiu cannot understand, he nods.</p><p>His second mistake is to comment to Luo Binghe that his cooking was above decent. Shen Jiu doesn’t know how to give or receive compliments. That is why he didn’t expect Luo Binghe to smile as if he had been told that his abilities are excellent (and they are, but he is not going to acknowledge that yet).</p><p>Since that day, Luo Binghe has taken care of all his meals. His enthusiasm is so exaggerated as when he trains, and he prepares enough rations even for the two of them and more. He could invite half the lords of the peaks! Shen Jiu complains about him for wasting food, but Shen Yuan laughs behind his back.</p><p>Two days after the incident with the monster, Shen Jiu meets Liu Qingge. Instead of ignoring him as normal, the War God approaches with determined steps and a defiant look. <em> There is no doubt, Shen Yuan is right: he's back to being his usual self. </em>Shen Jiu sighs. He just wants peace, no complications with stubborn cultivators who only think about fighting. Although sometimes it is fun to miserably defeat him or leave him speechless.</p><p>“Did you like the monster?” He splutters.</p><p><em> This idiot, he doesn't even know his name! He sure doesn’t know his properties either. </em>Shen Jiu fans himself while he hides a mischievous smile. Why lie to him when the truth is an even worse weapon?</p><p>“Yes, very much. Thanks, shidi.”</p><p>Liu Qingge flashes a relieved smile and Shen Jiu's eyes widen.</p><p>“I'm glad,” he says before turning his back on him and leaving, as lost in his world of battles and bloody claws as ever. Shen Jiu, despite his intentions, is the one who remains muted and perplexed.</p><p>“You don't even think of bringing any more!” He yells at him. “Or I'll make you clean my entire peak!”</p><p>Shen Jiu walks away growling through his teeth. At least this time he has Shen Yuan to complain about his strange behavior.</p>

<p>
<span>Shen Jiu watches how Shen Yuan reads the disciples' redactions as comments and exclamations escape him. His opinion is irrelevant, but Shen Jiu hasn’t found any problem allowing him to read them. When he finishes with the last one, Shen Yuan is smiling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ning Yingying has a lot of imagination! Her redaction is one of my favorites.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu clicks his tongue in obvious disgust since he is disappointed with his favorite disciple.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The text is decent, but her calligraphy can be improved.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Perhaps, but her writing is original and uses words very well. It contrasts with Ming Fan's: exquisite calligraphy, but his sentences are empty.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu frowns, since he considers Ming Fan's redaction the best, as expected from his head disciple. He grabs his cup of tea.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sometimes I suspect that you forget that this is the peak of the four arts and strategy. I don't want mediocre disciples.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not saying that!” Shen Yuan protests heatedly, waving his arms in exaggerated gestures. “Knowing how to write is as important as beautiful handwriting. I know what I'm talking about, in my other life I was a very renowned literary critic.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh.” Shen Jiu looks at him curiously. Shen Yuan doesn't usually talk about who he was before a strange force dragged him into his body. "What does that mean?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I read books, mainly fiction, and commented on my observations. I have a talent for recognizing bad stories and pointing out all their mistakes.” He clears his throat, a slight blush on his cheeks, and Shen Jiu knows that he won't say more. “That is why I consider what you write is as important as how you write it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He is right, but Shen Jiu won't recognize him out loud. So he continues to drink his bamboo tea while Shen Yuan flips through the redactions again. For a few seconds, neither says anything. Then the tranquility becomes that silence that precedes when Shen Yuan wants to speak but hesitates to choose his words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu snorts and hits the table with the teacup.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you want to say something, just do it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well...” Shen Yuan drums his fingers on the papers, his gaze nervously searching Shen Jiu. “I don't know what you had planned, but what do you think if we propose personalized activities to the disciples?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Explain.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Those who have done good writing like Ning Yingying but need to improve their calligraphy can repeat the writing. Those who like Ming Fan have good calligraphy, but their writing is weak, they should write something new. And those who are like Luo Binghe..." He sighs, visibly disappointed. Because Luo Binghe's talent and enthusiasm are not reflected in the arts. "Let them try to improve his latest writing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu puts a hand on his chin as he evaluates his idea. He doesn't dislike it. And that's a new feeling that he doesn't know how to handle. Shen Jiu is terrified to start giving Shen Yuan shreds of his life, irretrievable little pieces.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will value it.” His answer is dry, somewhat scathing, but Shen Yuan smiles with unseemly happiness on his face. It's strange and uncomfortable, and Shen Jiu gulps as he wonders if he would be able to learn how to smile again or if he has lost that talent forever.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, the calm is broken with a scandal of childish screams. Shen Jiu sighs as he recognizes the clear signs of Bai Zhan Peak's vandals coming to annoy his disciples. He rubs his forehead, giddy with a sudden headache.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your turn,” he hisses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan blinks as confused as surprised.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What turn?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your turn to stop the children from making noise.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan mutters something like "Unbelievable" while getting up. His steps are accelerated and disappear quickly when he reaches the door and leaves. Calm soon returns and Shen Jiu closes his eyes in satisfaction before pouring himself more tea. In exchange for regaining tranquility, Shen Yuan returns bringing chaos with him in the form of complaints and curses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s wrong with Bai Zhan children? It's the third time we've been harassed this week!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It is a tradition of Bai Zhan Peak to disturb Qing Jing Peak,” he explains, downing half the teacup in one gulp. “It was worse when I was a disciple, believe me. Those fools wouldn't leave me alone, they even ambushed me several times. Liu Qingge once got angry because I broke the arm of one of his siblings, unaware that it was his shidi who tried to treacherously attack me on the Rainbow Bridge.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan widens his eyes, offended and annoyed. Although it‘s not the first time that Shen Jiu has revealed a piece of his shameful past (and he still doesn’t understand why he does it), this time he perceives that Shen Yuan believes in him without reservation or second thoughts. He believes him. Someone believes him. It's a new sensation that makes him shudder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He doesn't know if he likes it or not.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s horrible! Is there no law here that prohibits </span>
<em>
<span>bullying</span>
</em>
<span>?” Sometimes, he uses unfamiliar words that Shen Jiu doesn't recognize. “It's the same with Binghe a few years ago! Why are cultivators like this?” Shen Jiu squints as he realizes that Shen Yuan wasn’t a cultivator in the past, although he possesses a profound knowledge unrelated to an ordinary person. “Has no one tried to do anything to change it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu drinks again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The world is cruel. It breaks you. And you can only rebuild yourself from sharp pieces or die.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s inhuman!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, it’s reality. Either you have the talent or you hang your head.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan purses his lips in a line. When he gets angry his resemblance to Shen Jiu is almost perfect.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Or you become powerful enough to change the world,” he declares with the naivety typical of those who have never suffered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu sighs as he shakes his head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That will never happen. Power corrupts. You forget all your good wishes after climbing a mountain alone, shattering your bones, painting the road with blood. When you finally reach the top, you have lost all hope for a better world.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A spark of sadness glows in Shen Yuan's eyes, but his optimism doesn’t disappear. Shen Jiu still barely knows him, but he already understands that he is a headstrong and stubborn person. And with a way of thinking very different from the rest of the people he meets.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The world would always remain the same if that were true," he declares with confidence that leaves Shen Jiu speechless. "Why not start with small steps? Let's talk to Liu Qingge so that his disciples will stop bothering ours." A bright smile flashes on his face. “Perhaps we can end that stupid tradition.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I refuse.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu finishes his teacup at Shen Yuan's disappointed look.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why!?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don't want to waste my time with him.” Shen Jiu raises his head and a crooked smirk appears on his lips. "Do you want to try? I won't stop you. But it will be useless."</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Pffff, I'm going right now!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Really?“ Shen Jiu almost laughs. That's strange, he doesn't remember when was the last time he felt the heat of a laugh in his throat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah. I don't care if we are theoretically rivals. Our fight must not affect the disciples.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu considers this to be a futile effort, but he doesn’t stop him, even encourages him with the fan to go to the door. And Shen Yuan does.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you succeed, I will let you be Shen Qingqiu for a week.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan stops.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you serious?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m always serious. Good luck,” and he adds wickedly. “You are going to need it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan walks with furious steps towards Bai Zhan Peak. The conversation he has had with the scum villain has left a bitter aftertaste in his throat, a certain uneasiness in his chest. At first, that made him think of Luo Binghe's fate. Then in Shen Qingqiu’s. With a teacher with such a mindset, it's no surprise that Luo Binghe will be darkened. But he wants to try, even if it's a lost cause. Because changing that cruel little tradition will mean that he has the power to create a better place. A world in which Luo Binghe remains naive and happy, in which he doesn’t fear for his life and Shen Qingqiu…</span>
</p><p>
<span>His thoughts freeze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan has begun to doubt his opinion on the scum villain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He finds Liu Qingge teaching at Bai Zhan Peak. In other words, beating up all the children who end up landing on the ground after a swift flight. Shen Yuan sighs, rolling his eyes, before approaching him. His presence doesn’t go unnoticed. The green of his robe stands out against the sand and his footsteps echo, confident and determined, even though his heart is pounding. All the disciples stop fighting to watch him suspiciously. Liu Qingge turns and raises an eyebrow in recognition.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Liu-shidi,” he greets him. “Can I exchange a few words with you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He nods, as eloquent as ever. His gaze is fixed on Shen Yuan, who raises his fan a little more to hide his face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I really appreciate you. You are a brave and loyal warrior, but I cannot understand why you allow your disciples to harass and treacherously attack mine.” Liu Qingge frowns, but that only encourages Shen Yuan to continue speaking. “It's hard to focus on Qing Jing Peak with so much fuss and I'm tired of sending mines with Mu Qingfang. Is this what you consider a fair fight?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan has a powerful motivation (to be free for a week) and his determination doesn’t waver despite being in enemy territory. He has rehearsed in his head what he will say and, in case of Liu Qingge acts like a rival blinded by hatred, he will blackmail him with the fact that he saved his life.</span>
</p><p>
<span>To his surprise, Liu Qingge crosses his arms and faces his disciples. Although his expression has barely changed, Shen Yuan can recognize a hint of disappointment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s that true?” He demands, his voice clear and loud.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait, you didn’t know anything?” Shen Yuan closes his fan without hiding his surprise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The disciples exchange terrified glances and some begin to babble excuses that only darken Liu Qingge's expression. Shen Yuan doesn't need any more information to know how it's going to end, or why Liu Qingge turns to him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry,” he says. “I wasn’t aware. Now I’ll take care of it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait, Liu-shidi! Beating them to death will solve nothing!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And he is against child abuse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge looks at him curiously. Expectant. Although Shen Yuan had imagined many scenarios in his head on the way to Bai Zhan Peak, he never believed that the stubborn War God would actually be listening to him. Waiting for his opinion. Faint blush on his cheeks while he begins to fan himself. </span>
<em>
<span>Why are all the Peak Lords a mess handling kids? Have they passed any exam to be teachers?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Punishing them won't do any good if they don't understand why it's wrong. Or, at least, if his punishment is something honorific. Send them to copy a thousand times and they won't repeat it. I hope so,” he adds, a little desperate. “I just want to avoid any more fights. They are martial brothers, I don't understand why they detest each other so much.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I understand your point of view.” Liu Qingge nods. “I will think of a punishment with which they learn their lesson. Forever.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>He sounds even more threatening than when he brought a monster to Qing Jing Peak. Shen Yuan walks away as the disciples' shriek and whimper and beg for forgiveness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shizun, please!” They cry. “Hit us a thousand times, but don't make us copy a thousand times!”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Shen Jiu decides to give Bai Zhan Peak a month to confirm Shen Yuan's success. His feelings are contradictory, as his pride would hate that he wins, but a small part of him wishes for that victory against Bai Zhan Peak.</p><p>He is explaining to the disciples the next part of the writing activities after dividing them into three groups (who must improve their calligraphy, writing, or everything) when Liu Qingge lands. His presence at Qing Jing Peak has become anecdotal, and Shen Jiu sighs before shooting him a glacial look behind the fan.</p><p>“What is the pleasure, shidi?” He asks him in a scathing tone, without a hint of sympathy. Liu Qingge acts nonchalant.</p><p>“I have spoken with Zhangmen-shixiong. We are going on a night hunt.”</p><p>“What are you talking about?” He loses control over his perfect appearance in the face of the unexpected news.</p><p>“You, me, and our child...” A little flush appears in his ears. “Disciples.”</p><p>“Can you please explain what you mean?”</p><p>Liu Qingge has the nerve to look at him strangely as if it is Shen Jiu who is acting odd.</p><p>“You told me that our disciples fight. And that punishment wouldn’t be enough if they fight again. Let them train together.”</p><p>“Let me understand,” he massages his temples. “Do you want the two of us to go hunting with your little barbarians and…?” He stops to find that all of his disciples are staring at them with bright eyes and a hint of insecurity mixed with interest.</p><p>“A few days. The best way for them to stop fighting is if they learn how to work together.”</p><p>Shen Jiu clenches his teeth, refusing to acknowledge that Liu Qingge's idea is not horrible, just naive. People never change. But if Yue Qingyuan has accepted, he cannot refuse now. He also doesn’t dare to face him knowing that he has failed him again.</p><p>“We can test it, but it won't work.” He sighs. He could send Shen Yuan in his place, he doesn't feel like spending so much time with his former nemesis and a bunch of stupid kids, but it's too risky. “I hope we go to a very inhospitable place where I can bury your body and no one finds it.”</p><p>For some inexplicable reason, Liu Qingge smiles, and something inside Shen Qingqiu trembles.</p>

<p>
<span>The teenagers are yelling nonsense, Liu Qingge is staring at him, and Shen Jiu wants to kill someone. And they still haven't left the sect.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He doesn't think he will survive the excursion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu wonders for the umpteenth time why he agreed to Liu Qingge's damn excursion. Right now, any plan, even discussing with Shen Yuan about learning methods would be more exciting. He sighs, reluctantly accepting his fate, and steps forward to demand silence from them. Shen Jiu doesn't expect the Bai Zhan Peak brats to listen to him (and they don't), but from his own, he expects a lot more decency and politeness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge appears with his characteristic arrogant elegance. His firm footsteps make his disciples finally shut up. The admiration they have for a teacher who is usually absent is inexplicable. Liu Qingge walks among the horses to stand beside Shen Qingqiu. Like him, he greets him with a grunt before crossing his arms and observing the group they have both organized.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is everything ready?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mn.” Shen Jiu plays with his fan as he checks one last time that all of his disciples are carrying their luggage and that there are enough mounts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We should go.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu nods. Seeing that Liu Qingge plans to turn his back to head towards the horses, Shen Jiu stops him by leaning the tip of his fan against his chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You come with me,” he orders with his most uncompromising voice, hiding his deep disgust at the prospect of locking himself in a carriage alone with him. His patience is ridiculously paltry, even worse than his usual humor, and he suspects that if Liu Qingge protests they will end up fighting. However, he frowns at him not with disdain, but uncertainty.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“With you? Why?” His question is ridiculous, but something inside Shen Jiu (something small and nameless) appreciates that he questions rather than acting impulsively. “I prefer to ride a horse. You should ride next to me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The truth is, Shen Jiu doesn't like to ride a horse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We must discuss what we will do,” he explains. Shen Jiu hides the poison of his voice for once. Liu Qingge deserves the gift of his cold courtesy as thanks for his patience. “We haven't talked about the trip. Neither what we will do nor what are our objectives. Let's talk inside the carriage.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge surprises him again by silently nodding. Shen Jiu doesn't know how to feel when his wayward rival follows him without protest or complaint, but calmly accepting a logical argument. Shen Jiu senses something warm inside his chest again as he wonders what their relationship would have been if Liu Qingge had acted this reasonably from the first time they met.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They walk to the carriage while giving the last orders, under the watchful eye of their disciples. There are too many according to Shen Jiu. Neither of them had considered the other's disciples when they organized their respective groups. Shen Jiu only planned to bring his most troubled disciples like Luo Binghe or Ming Fan, but Shen Yuan had recommended that he should also take some of the more patient ones such as Ning Yingying to bring balance and common sense.</span>
</p><p><span>They will easily have to keep an eye on thirty excited teenagers among whom sparks of friction fly</span> <span>at the slightest touch. All it needs is a glance, a nudge, for both groups to threaten to cut the other's throats. And half still don’t have spiritual weapons.</span></p><p>
<span>“We should talk carefully about what we are going to do,” Shen Jiu begins when both of them are already seated in the carriage. Although there is enough space, he feels very cramped and claustrophobic. Shen Jiu doesn't remember the last time he was alone in such a small place with Liu Qingge. “I had thought that we could pair them up or organize mixed groups to jointly set up camp. Rather than throwing them into a fight, it may be more effective for them to work together cooking or doing the watch.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Actually, this is another suggestion from Shen Yuan. Shen Jiu rests the tip of his fan on his lips. Shen Yuan's ideas are beginning to interest him. Although his mentality is very different from his, his way of thinking makes sense and turns out to be effective. Well, now they are both Shen Qingqiu, so there is nothing wrong with using his ideas as if they belong to him. Shen Jiu is very good at defending his thoughts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His rhetoric is useless today since Liu Qingge agrees to almost all of his proposals and only makes a couple of remarks to which he is not entirely satisfied. To Shen Qingqiu's surprise, all of his comments are direct and overflow with simple but effective logic. Since the incident at the Lingxi Caves, Liu Qingge has become oddly pleasant. He is still just as sullen and unaware as ever, but he doesn't argue with him as much anymore. And he listens to what he says. Shen Jiu considers whether Shen Yuan instead of saving his life has replaced him with another stranger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Suddenly, he feels uncertain if he is the real Liu Qingge or a stranger with the same face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just in case, Shen Jiu will keep an eye on him very closely. And then he will ask Shen Yuan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Despite his pessimistic expectations, the journey is unexpectedly smooth. He and Liu Qingge talk a lot, first about his disciples, then about sect matters. The silence is brief and not uncomfortable as on other occasions. When Shen Jiu starts to get bored, he talks to him about beasts and Liu Qingge discusses some details with genuine interest. It is too nice and Shen Jiu knows that like all happy things that moment is doomed to break, so he decides to enjoy it. This is perhaps the first time that he has felt almost relaxed since his life was splitting with the arrival of Shen Yuan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Their destination is a forest near the sect. The two organize the disciples to set up camp together. Neither of them tolerates the complaints and Liu Qingge indistinctly growls at all the teens who are protesting about the distribution of chores.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu's secret weapon is to leave Luo Binghe in charge of the food. Despite his rotten feelings for the boy, Shen Jiu fans himself as he watches the barbarians of Bai Zhan Peak react to that delicious smell that conquers the entire camp. As he had imagined, all the children soften their attitude a bit when they can finally taste their food. That plan belonged to him, the next step is Shen Yuan's idea: encourage his disciples to play the instruments to create a relaxed and pleasant atmosphere. Ning Yingying begins with a popular piece and some guys from Bai Zhan Peak accompany it with shy claps.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu hums with his lips brushing the fan. The hunt started unexpectedly... fine. The most curious thing is that he feels Shen Yuan's presence, even though he has stayed behind. However, his double accompany them in all those ideas that come true. Shen Jiu looks up at the sky as he wonders what Shen Yuan is doing now. Most of his thoughts are of insecurity, as he still suspects a possible betrayal, but he also has a little concern about leaving him locked up in the bamboo house for so long. At least he has left him enough bestiaries before he leaves. That will be enough, right?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu shakes his head. Since when is he so weak to feel compassion for someone who intended to impersonate him? Annoyed with himself, he picks up two plates and walks among the disciples, ignoring their chatter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He finds Liu Qingge with his back against a pine tree and staring at distant peaks, surely assessing what kind of monsters he will encounter. Shen Qingqiu wouldn't be surprised if he left them to go hunting alone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“For you,” he says as he hands him one of the dishes. Liu Qingge looks at him curiously. “You should eat something or they will eat you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That's not gonna happen.” Still, Liu Qingge accepts the plate and sits on the ground.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu has no reason to sit next to him instead of leaving, but he does. Liu Qingge has chosen a place far from the noise of the teenagers, sheltered from the wind. The views are also beautiful: there is an orange sunset that softens Shen Jiu's heart a bit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mn? That's... good,” Liu Qingge mutters. He tastes so slowly that Shen Jiu almost laughs. It's funny that this barbarian who only thinks about hunting and slaughtering monsters sometimes shows some excellent manners. “You weren't lying: your disciple's abilities are amazing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I never lie,” Shen Jiu lies with a smirk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They are so close that he can appreciate how Liu Qingge frowns as he values his words and decides whether or not to trust him. Shen Jiu turns away and looks at his food.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You're acting weird lately, shidi,” he growls, unable to understand him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge shrugs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You started.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Because sometimes I'm someone else, it's normal! Although Shen Yuan tries, he will never be able to impersonate me perfectly. Which is your excuse?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Of course, Shen Jiu doesn't say anything and the two of them have dinner in silence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As he had feared, that pleasant moment of peace is ripped apart by a chorus of high-pitched, unpleasant howls. The two of them stand up at the same time, their swords already drawn and illuminated in their hands. Shen Jiu snorts while he recognizes the silhouette of three Ancient Stone Bats in the sky. Although their flight is erratic, the scandal of the brats and the lights of the camp has attracted their attention.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A good opponent,” Liu Qingge comments, bowing his head approvingly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don't you ever dare! Those beasts are above the level of our disciples.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu nearly hit him with the fan on the head, but Liu Qingge was acting reasonably for the first time in his life and nodded, still glaring at the Ancient Stone Bats.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I'll take care of it, protect the kids.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu purses his lips. The need to contradict him is an almost primitive instinct, as basic as breathing, but if Liu Qingge has been able to give up before, he will do even better. Shen Jiu hits him in agreement and his fingers rest for a few seconds on his shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Its weak point is in the back, right where its wings are born.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge nods with a grunt and after that tactical arrangement, Shen Jiu turns his back on him and runs to join the youngsters. The screeches of the monsters have not gone unnoticed and the disciples have gathered in the defensive positions of Bai Zhan Peak and Qing Jing Peak. They have separated again, but it's better this way: their fighting techniques are too different to combine without previous experience.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Liu-shidi will take care of the monsters, you stay here with me.” Of course, Shen Qingqiu does not plan to miss this opportunity to resume his lessons. </span>
<em>
<span>It's time for the Bai Zhan Peak brats to appreciate the role of Qing Jing Peak. </span>
</em>
<span>“Can anyone tell me its name?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ancient Stone Bats!” Luo Binghe answers, as excited as ever. His eyes shine like the embers of the bonfire in which minutes before he was cooking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Correct. Another one,” Shen Jiu is uncomfortable with Luo Binghe's enthusiasm. And since Shen Yuan has participated in some lessons, the brat's interest has grown suspiciously. “Can you describe the best way to kill them?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ming Fan doesn’t disappoint him, although Shen Jiu notes that his descriptions are bloody and gory as if he wants to impress the brats of Bai Zhan Peak with his knowledge... or explain in great detail its triple rows of teeth and the sharp claws with which they split the bones of their victims to absorb the marrow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu doesn't reproach him for anything. It's funny how some of the barbarian kids have turned pale, though others seem even more excited.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A pale flash streaks across the sky as Liu Qingge begins to hunt them down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Any more details?” He asks, looking at all of his disciples and those of Bai Zhan Peak. This time around, not even Luo Binghe answers. And that seems to frustrate him, which makes Shen Jiu smile wickedly. "Nobody? There is a fundamental detail that nobody has mentioned yet." As he suspected, none have studied that much. Maybe when they come back he'll give them a monster test. And Shen Yuan may take care of it while he relaxes in the bamboo house. "Ancient Stone Bats always hunt in packs of even numbers."</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But shizun...” Luo Binghe mutters uncertain. “I only see three facing Liu-shishu.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu tenses as he remembered that he also had only seen three in the sky. After muttering a curse under his breath, he raises his sword and watches around him. It is unusual for Ancient Stone Bats to travel in odd numbers. There are documented cases where they have gone so far as to kill the weakest member of the pack to equal numbers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No howl is heard. The forest remains restless, the silence broken by the excited breaths of the disciples. Shen Jiu squints his eyes as he watches the shadows.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There is a howl and a gray monster emerges from the treetops, its bark is hard and its wings are ripping through the air. Some disciples shriek while others (essentially Luo Binghe and the ones from Bai Zhan Peak) come forward to protect their martial brothers. Shen Jiu curses all of them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don't act recklessly!” He growls at them through his teeth as he gets between them and the Ancient Stone Bat. A turn of the wing manages to scratch his leg, but Shen Jiu aims his qi at the monster's eyes and destabilizes it. Its skin is too thick to break through and he can't risk leaving the children unprotected while he searches for his weak point, so he keeps it distracted with Xiu Ya. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The disciples whistle and clap and cheer him on as Shen Jiu taunts the monster. Luo Binghe's spirits are the proudest, the loudest, and something inside Shen Jiu squirms. It doesn´t have any sense. He hates the child and is sure that the child hated him when he punished him. What has Shen Yuan done?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Perhaps Shen Yuan is a kind of cunning demon who softens the personality of those around him and that is why even Liu Qingge acts nice to him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu is not distracted despite his cabal. When Liu Qingge appears and with one accurate strike neutralizes the Ancient Stone Bat, Shen Jiu doesn't even blink. He sheathes Xiu Ya elegantly. Seeing Liu Qingge disheveled and sweaty, his face flushed and his clothes stained with blood fills him with wicked satisfaction. Except for the leg cut, he has kept his pristine appearance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Everyone is fine?” He asks, sheathing Cheng Luan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu nods. The commotion of the disciples it’s so loud that even if he answers, he couldn’t hear him. There are many shouts of enthusiasm, yet Liu Qingge ignores them. He frowned upon noticing Shen Jiu's bloody leg.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You are hurt.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hm? It’s nothing. I have some medicinal herbs in the carriage.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I'll bring them, shizun!” Luo Binghe exclaims before he even gives the order.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Well, maybe it's not a bad thing that the little beast has become so tame.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu stiffens when Liu Qingge approaches him. There is something strange in his gaze, a concern almost similar to Shen Yuan's when he discovered that he was poisoned. Shen Jiu opens the fan and outlines his best expression of disdain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“As I said, It’s no… LIU QINGGE!!!!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He yells when Liu Qingge picks him up into his arms, ignoring his blows and kicks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Stop moving,” he growls. “You're going to hurt yourself even more.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Of course, Shen Jiu continues to try to break free. They are in front of their disciples! Why does he never think? It's just a bulky scratch! As he keeps trying to hit him, Liu Qingge holds him even tighter, pushing him against his chest and Shen Jiu's head just leans against his shoulder. And suddenly Shen Jiu is aware of how hot his skin is and that his breathing is still accelerated after the fight. When he opens his mouth to protest, Shen Jiu discovers that his throat is dry.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He should be angry, but what is roaring in his chest is just confusion.</span>

<p>
<span>Luo Binghe is a loyal and well-trained disciple. His fearlessness even encourages him to stop the Bai Zhan Peak Lord when Liu Qingge lands on Qing Jing Peak intending to go to the bamboo house.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shizun doesn't want to be disturbed!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe is still small, although his muscles are already beginning to mark and in recent months he has gained several centimeters. Compared to Liu Qingge he is still a little sheep, even so, he is not afraid of him. Liu Qingge frowns, unaccustomed to such a lack of respect.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Leave. I've come to see how your shizun's wounds are.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shizun doesn’t wish to be disturbed by anyone, not even the other Peak Lords.” Luo Binghe smirks maliciously. “I can announce your presence, Liu-shishu, but you will have to wait here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge is visibly upset. He crosses his arms but makes no move to continue walking. Luo Binghe considers that this is righteous revenge after the liberties he took by carrying his shizun in his arms. Before turning around, he took one last look at his martial uncle. Luo Binghe dreams of growing up and being like Liu Qingge, powerful enough to protect shizun, strong enough to care for shizun. In his fantasies, Luo Binghe is even taller, more muscular, more skilled, and handsome.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe doesn't tell him that the disciples can't go to the bamboo house either.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nor is it necessary: the two of them have spoken so loudly that the door opens and Shen Qingqiu himself comes out of the house. He looks as stylish as ever. His hair is perfectly adorned with green ribbons and a crown, his robes are the color of the bamboo and enhance his graceful and divine figure. While Liu Qingge acts like a legendary warrior, Shen Qingqiu looks like a true immortal, too ethereal to be bothered by the mortal world.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You two again?” He sighs, raising his fan to hide his expression. Even so, Luo Binghe knows that he is smiling. “It was just a scratch and it's been two days. This master is fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>In fact, Shen Qingqiu is very fine, </span>
</em>
<span>thinks Shen Yuan, who has just suffered the authentic Shen Qingqiu combing his hair until there was not a single hair out of place. </span>
<em>
<span>He's just taking a vacation.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan considers the authentic Shen Qingqiu to be a bit dramatic.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe is still concerned about his shizun and he promises that he will cook him a delicious meal today.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge doesn’t understand why he has the urge to visit Shen Qingqiu every day.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Two nights before.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>At the beginning of the trip, Shen Jiu wished to kill someone. Well, that feeling hasn't gone away and he already has a couple of names in mind. First, Liu Qingge, who has carried him to the carriage and insisted on taking care of his wound (Shen Jiu is not even the one who saved his life, why is he treating him like this?). Second, Luo Binghe, who seems about to cry in case his shizun dies (Really? It's just a scratch!) and insists on taking care of his wound as well.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Leave! This is nothing! I can heal myself!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They ignore his complaints.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shizun, we have these pills that Mu-shishu has prepared. You should take them all.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shen Qingqiu, stop moving so I can examine your wound.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I also have the sachet we made with the plants from Mu-shishu's garden!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tsk. It's shallow, but you've bled a lot. Don't move your leg.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Liu-shishu! What are you doing? Don't disgrace shizun!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you saying, brat? Leave.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But shizun...”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu is livid, using all his willpower to not behead them both. The two of them are talking non-stop and their discussion is giving him a headache. The fact that they treat him as if he is fragile is more humiliating than showing a leg to clean the wound. All his good thoughts were gone: Luo Binghe is a disobedient brat and Liu Qingge is still as stubborn as ever. Neither listens to him and Shen Jiu begins to stress. So much attention overwhelms him. It is too much and that makes him feel furious.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As if that weren't enough, upon returning to Cang Qiong Sect they have caused such a scandal that Yue Qingyuan appears very concerned to ask about his condition.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu returns to the bamboo house slamming the door, annoyed with everyone and not wanting to see anyone else. Never.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You,” he hisses when Shen Yuan leaves his room. Shen Yua is smart enough to erase his smile and the possible question he was going to ask him. “You have won the bet. Take your week.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan looks at him for a few seconds. His gaze is fixed on the bloodstained clothing, perhaps on his expression as well.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you… okay? Do you want to talk?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu wants silence. And rest. And a bath. And a week off in which no one overwhelms him with false concern about him. He wants to forget about the whole world, however... He hates Shen Yuan's hypocritical interest and no, he doesn't want to talk to anyone. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He wants to complain. A little. Not admitting out loud the reasons why he has been overwhelmed so much when they carry him up or don’t give him space. They are shameful and terrible reasons; reasons so tangled in his heart that Shen Jiu doesn't quite understand them either. But without realizing it, he opens his mouth and starts to complain. He complains that Liu Qingge never listens to him while he takes off his crown. He complains that they are all exaggerated while he changes his clothes. He complains that Yue Qingyuan is the most hypocritical of all while he checks whether he can fix the pants or the monster has irretrievably ripped them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It's just a scratch,” Shen Yuan comments when Shen Jiu finally takes a deep breath and tries to relax. “I think it's nice that they care about you. And I imagine Liu Qingge is acting very cute.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It's not. It’s stressful and annoying. Is it so difficult for them to understand that I want to be alone? That I need it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan gives him one of those indecipherable glances, so common lately, and Shen Jiu trembles, aware of his slip. He has talked too much. There is an important nuance between </span>
<em>
<span>wanting </span>
</em>
<span>and </span>
<em>
<span>needing</span>
</em>
<span>. Fortunately, Shen Yuan doesn't insist. However, Shen Jiu still feels awkward. It's a different tension that now weighs him inside his chest: with the others, he felt frustrated because they ignored his request for solitude; with Shen Yuan, he is starting to feel unprotected. They talk too much and more and more naturally. And that is a mistake.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan can be an enemy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Deal with them this week,” he growls, shielding himself behind his mask of indifference. “I don't even want to hear their names.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>To his surprise, Shen Yuan smiles in amusement. It’s a sincere smile, without mockery or malice. Shen Jiu knows that Shen Yuan has understood him and that’s terrifying.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Thanks to that, Shen Yuan has gained a week to continue training Luo Binghe and earning his affection. He has plans, ideas that Shen Qingqiu would never approve of, but right now no one can stop him. After saying goodbye to Liu Qingge (Shen Yuan still doesn't know what to think about him, but it is fundamental to be kind to a possible ally), Shen Yuan meets with his disciples. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Today, he is going to teach them to role-play.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yesterday you were studying the bestiaries, today we will put into practice what you have learned.” Shen Yuan closes the fan in a convincing blow. “For that, you are going to participate in an activity very different from the usual ones...”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan explains that they are going to invent a </span>
<em>
<span>character</span>
</em>
<span>. After an entire night of brainstorming, he has finally decided how to organize this RPG game. Their </span>
<em>
<span>characters </span>
</em>
<span>will initially have low cultivation levels and will be unarmed. Depending on how they answer the questions he will ask, their characters will gain experience and new skills. To avoid suspicion, they all start from the same numbers, although Shen Yuan gives each teen a unique ability to make it more fun. Luo Binghe's is to be a half-demon.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There is a gleam of concern in Luo Binghe's eyes when he whispers it to him, but Shen Yuan feigns ignorance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan is quite proud to have developed a PIDW-based RPG in just one night. Tiredness makes him close his eyes, but the emotion in his veins prevents him from falling asleep. Furthermore, the fun of the disciples is as contagious as their smiles and he soon forgets that he is also playing a role.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After distributing the roles and clarifying the doubts (no one has ever played a role or participated in a play before) Shen Yuan divides them into groups to distribute missions. The first ones are simple since his objective is for them to understand the mechanics and apply what they have learned practically.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It's chaotic, but funny chaos. Shen Yuan watches as each group discusses the best strategies to solve all problems. Some of the teens worry about losing their life points and are very cautious, while others take too much risk knowing that it is just a game. Luo Binghe is one of the latter, so Shen Yuan punishes them with poisoning or sudden encounters with monsters so that they learn to value their decisions. In the future, fear shouldn't paralyze them... but he doesn't want them to die either!</span>
</p><p>
<span>After several hours, Shen Yuan clears his throat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It is the moment of the final mission. You are going to face several very dangerous monsters. If you defeat them, you will gain items and experience that will help you for tomorrow's session, but you can also end up injured.” All the teenagers look at him with impatient expectation, not knowing that these are real monsters that will try to assassinate them during the Alliance Conference. “In addition, those who are defeated will have to write an essay about the abilities and weak points of these monsters. And whoever defeats more monsters...” Shen Yuan hums absent-mindedly as he thinks. “They will get rid of chores for a week.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The redactions are for Shen Qingqiu. Although he is on vacation, a week of inactivity is too long and Shen Yuan has to give him material so that he is entertained or he will continue to scold him for his mannerisms. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The first day of role-playing ends with Luo Binghe winning. That isn’t a surprise, neither that he wins the next one or the next… Shen Yuan feels a little bad for the rest, but Luo Binghe's innate talent guides him through all the situations that he proposes. Perhaps because they are scenes that he has read in the book of his life, although Shen Yuan suspects that it is Luo Binghe's motivation that drives him to shine. His smile is the biggest and his eyes are the brightest whenever Shen Yuan congratulates him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Understandably, the protagonist doesn’t want to do more tasks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>What is not normal is that he insists on preparing food for them every day.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan is also not complaining, of course.</span>
</p><p>
<span>During that week of role-playing, all the disciples upgrade their characters under Shen Yuan's watch. PIDW events are quite versatile and he dissects them on little adventures. It is fun and educational. Shen Yuan returns to the bamboo house very happily every day, where Shen Qingqiu watches him silently and suspiciously. Luckily, he doesn't ask him anything and Shen Yuan avoids having to lie to him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although it also makes him happy to be free and interact with other human beings. If he was the protagonist of one of the novels that he liked to read, he would complain that his life was so boring, but he is beginning to appreciate Luo Binghe's delicious meals, Liu Qingge's constant presence at his peak scaring away his disciples, thinking of a different adventure for each day, and convincing the mulish scum villain to visit Qian Cao Peak.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan enjoys the sweet smell of bamboo. He wants to live and all the small changes that he is making secure that future in which no one dies.</span>
</p><p>
<span>However, following the PIDW plot has its consequences. One morning, Shen Yuan mistakenly catches some disciples in a sex pollen situation. It wasn’t his intention, but after finishing the arcs of the worst monsters, PIDW becomes a porn novel. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan freezes. As a reader, he thinks that PIDW has a ridiculous amount of porn. But he now lives in PIDW and that ridiculous amount of porn means he shouldn't act so careless. Unable to avoid it, Shen Yuan looks at all of his disciples. They look at him too, worried that his shizun has gone speechless and immobile. Shen Yuan sees some children who have grown to be young and will soon have their night hunts. Do they know that the real danger in this world isn’t demons but some flowers, monster secretions, enchanted caves, hexes...? What if they are alone on a mission and no one can help them in a fuck or die situation? What if they are accompanied by someone who would be horrible to dual cultivate with? How is dual cultivation different from normal sex?</span>
</p><p>
<span>He is starting to get overwhelmed. Too many possibilities. Too many things that can go wrong. The protagonist halo protects Luo Binghe and he always enjoyed all those erotic encounters as his harem grew, but what about the rest of them? Shen Yuan blushes at the thought that sweet Luo Binghe will soon go from a little sheep to a stallion. His shame turns to horror as he recalls the embarrassing awkward scenes of Luo Binghe's first sexual encounters.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shizun?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan returns to reality. After an apologetic smile, he backs away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Excuse me, this master was reminded that he has to do one thing. Finish writing today's adventures in a redaction. I'll pick them up tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He runs towards the bamboo house still haunted by those questions. It is incoherent that in a world with so much sexual charge, most of the characters are celibate monks or act with such chastity. In PIDW almost everyone was a virgin until they met Luo Binghe! That is implausible! It breaks the suspension of disbelief!</span>
</p><p>
<span>He opens the door with a sharp knock. Shen Qingqiu is sitting at the table reading the latest essays while he enjoys tea and some pastries that Luo Binghe has prepared this morning. Seeing his hasty expression, Shen Qingqiu frowns.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Something has happened? What has Liu Qingge done this time?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan should calm down and collect his thoughts, but that revelation has left him stunned and scared.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Disciples need sex education classes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu chokes on his tea, as elegant as ever, and Shen Yuan comprises that perhaps he should have proposed the dilemma to him with other words. It is already too late to regret it, so Shen Yuan closes the door and walks to the table with discrete steps.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please, explain yourself.” Shen Qingqiu's voice is cold and sharp like a knife. It is a voice that always pierces Shen Yuan's ribs and makes his heart tremble with uneasiness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan sits across from him. He no longer knows if his nervousness is due to the villain's inquisitive gaze or an echo of the stress he has felt a few minutes earlier.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well...” Words that once seemed so sensible and coherent tremble in his throat. He swallows hard as he tries to collect his thoughts. “The disciples are no longer children.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is not a world suitable for all audiences.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu frowns.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And what does that mean?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan has read over a thousand pages of hideous and exaggerated porn, with almost every combination, from the most traditional positions to orgies. Talking about it shouldn't be embarrassing, and yet a faint blush covers his cheeks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know… papapa…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu, even more irritated, massages his temples.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I definitely don't understand you.” He looks at him with a mixture of concern and distrust, although his tone of voice is indifferent. “You have spent too much time outside surrounded by inept people. You should rest and send those brats to do laps....“</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No! This is very important!” Shen Yuan is stressed enough to forget his fear of the scum villain and dares to raise his voice. “Listen to me well: in this world, there is an inordinately ridiculous number of plants and others that can cause a situation of... ahem... papapa...”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Stop making up words! What does </span>
<em>
<span>papapa </span>
</em>
<span>mean?”</span>
</p><p><span>Shen Yuan suddenly remembers that Shen Qingqiu is a famous pervert. Perhaps proposing these classes to him is very dangerous for female disciples, what if he tries to take advantage of the situation? Should Shen Yuan take the risk? Shen Qingqiu is a threat that may not </span><span>compensate </span> <span>for the disciples' current ignorance. However, he has already talked too much and Shen Qingqiu watches over him with an intensity that can't accept excuses.</span></p><p>
<span>“It’s...” Shen Yuan clenches his fists and decides to be brave for the future he's building. If Shen Qingqiu is a threat, he will defeat him. “Sex.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu makes a disgusted face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, I guess those brats will soon start thinking about... </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span>.” He grimaces again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>If Shen Yuan weren't so tense, he would find it amusing how Shen Qingqiu also avoids saying that word. While Shen Yuan is embarrassed, Shen Qingqiu acts like it’s too vulgar for someone as classy as him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What I mean is that there are many dangers that can end in... papapa. If they are alone, what should they do?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Release themselves,” Shen Qingqiu growls, still displeased.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not always possible! There are very uncomfortable plants that involve two people or that are solved in a certain way.” Generally, according to Luo Binghe's wishes, but Shen Yuan doesn't say it. “There are an overwhelmingly exaggerated amount of dangers that can create a mandatory papapa moment outside and the bestiaries hardly mention it. By that rule of three, all cultivators should travel in groups or pairs. What if they have to do papapa with someone unknown or even a demon takes advantage of the situation? That would be... rape, right? Even if they are saving your life.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan swallows. PIDW proposes everything in a very funny and sometimes erotic way, but the perspective of ending up suffering from sex pollen twists his guts and leaves a bitter taste in his mouth. In front of him, Shen Qingqiu is looking at him with a less aggressive curiosity that encourages him to keep talking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Disciples need sex education classes. All if is possible, not just the ones from Qing Jing Peak.” Shen Yuan spreads his fingers to target his arguments. “The classes should include the most common causes and how to prevent them. And a manual on how to intervene so that it is neither uncomfortable nor painful, also how to resist if you are alone. Probably also a theoretical explanation about dual cultivation and...” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan is speechless as he thinks of more problems. Are there contraceptive methods in this world? What about STDs? He definitely wants to kill the author for creating such an absurd and incoherent place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The sharp blow of a fan against the table tears him out of his reveries. Shen Yuan looks at Shen Qingqiu.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was sure you wanted to talk to me about more nonsense, but... it’s not a bad idea.” That's an unusual compliment by him. “Sadly, the other Peak Lords will ignore it or even be offended. Forget about them. But you can present those classes at Qing Jing Peak.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan didn’t imagine that Shen Qingqiu would agree so easily after scolding him for so many days because his classes are too creative. Again, he feels that fearful chill in case he is creating a situation favorable to a pervert. But the interest that shines in Shen Qingqiu's eyes is not lustful, but appreciative.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You said the same about Bai Zhan Peak and Liu Qingge,” he remembers him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu purses his lips in a fine line.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Listen to me this time: it won't work. It was Liu Qingge himself who spread rumors about me.” Shen Qingqiu shakes the hand holding the fan. His disdain hides a frustration of several years. “You have also suffered from my reputation as lecherous, right? It's thanks to your </span>
<em>
<span>cute</span>
</em>
<span> Liu-shidi.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan ignores the sarcasm in his voice. After the last events, he has started to question the fairness of PIDW. There are some objective facts, but others depend on Luo Binghe's POV. Mistreating children and coldly murdering sectmates is wrong, but... Why was Shen Qingqiu considered a pervert for going to brothels when Luo Binghe had a harem of six hundred wives? Luo Binghe is famous in and out of the novel for his massive cock, legendary stamina, and appreciation for female beauty. Maybe it's because Shen Yuan never liked that he had so many lovers and forgot about them, but now it is very easy for him to wonder why one is a pervert and the other is not.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan raises his head shyly. He has several ideas in mind with intertwined goals. Shen Qingqiu's latest complaint seems to hide more than is obvious.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe we could take advantage of that fame? It won’t seem strange to them if it is </span>
<em>
<span>Shen Qingqiu</span>
</em>
<span> who proposes it. That will create debate and won’t go unnoticed. And you could reproach them that you are the only one with enough courage to raise a serious problem that the entire cultivation world is ignoring.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you trying to manipulate me to get your way?” Shen Qingqiu lets out a surprised laugh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No!” Shen Yuan snorts, offended. “I'm serious! I really think this is a huge and horrible problem, but nobody does anything out of shame or appearances. Can you imagine Liu Qingge or Yue Qingyuan talking about papapa? I’m not.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The image must be quite funny, as Shen Qingqiu laughs even harder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I would die to see it,” he acknowledges with a smile. His grin is brief and it immediately disappears behind a grimace. “Please stop saying </span>
<em>
<span>papapa </span>
</em>
<span>when you talk about sex. It's ridiculous.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry.” Shen Yuan tries, but Shen Qingqiu imposes too much to talk lightly about sex with him. “And you have experience with dual cultivation, so you can give those classes...”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where did you get that nonsense? Maybe I have a reputation for being a pervert, but I have no experience with dual cultivation.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan blinks. His entire thread of thoughts and arguments has been broken with an unexpected counterattack.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But the brothels...”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A slight blush stains Shen Qingqiu’s cheeks, who opens his fan and hides behind too late: Shen Yuan has been able to appreciate his expression of insecurity and shame.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dual cultivation involves a cultivation partner. Another cultivator.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although it’s a coherent explanation, Shen Yuan squints his eyes as he wonders what exactly Shen Qingqiu does in brothels. The answer no longer seems so simple. He finds incoherent that a man so fussy, who is overwhelmed by physical contact and hates attention, turns to prostitutes. Maybe Shen Yuan is wrong, but now he doesn’t intend to forget that suspicion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My mistake.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu snorts, there is almost a smile on his lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don't seem to have experience either, am I right? What a nefarious teacher you would be.” He mocks him, without evil or his characteristic cruelty. “Will you look for information in another bestiary?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can teach them to recognize the most common plants and monsters.” Shen Yuan clears his throat, somewhat embarrassed. “But you're right. We need another teacher.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The two look at each other. Shen Yuan wonders how he ended up talking to the villain of a bad porn novel about how to teach the protagonist about papapa. Now that the stress is gone, Shen Yuan can't help it and laughs. He tries to cover his face with his hand, but it’s useless: it’s an absurd situation that sums to several days full of smiles.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Raising his head, he discovers that Shen Qingqiu is still hiding behind his fan. His eyes are narrowed in an almost friendly way, betraying that he too seems amused by the conversation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What about Mu Qingfang?” Shen Yuan proposes after calming down. “After all, dual cultivation is a medical procedure.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hmm...” Shen Qingqiu closes the fan in time with his hums. “It's not a bad idea. He might listen to us if we talk to him in private. And the other Peak Lords maybe will listen to him. He's also the best at teaching classes without a lot of hormonal teens getting too excited.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan blinks very quickly, stunned to realize that the two of them have started speaking in the plural without realizing it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So...” Shy, he begins to fiddle with his fan. “Do you like my proposal?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu snorts while rolling his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If I didn't like it, I would have sent you to your room to copy the rules of Qing Jing Peak one hundred times.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Even Shen Qingqiu's threats are starting to change. Less deadly, more... typical. Shen Yuan doesn't know how to feel about it, so he shuts up and nods.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu stands up to put away the essays he was reading and takes ink, brush, and paper.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course, we are going to propose a complete educational program. I’m not going to lose my face for a poorly executed idea,” he warns him with his characteristic coldness. “We need to write all the content that we will present to the other Peak Lords and what arguments we will give them. I know them well, so I can take care of that part.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can investigate bestiaries!“</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Of course,” Shen Qingqiu shakes his head with a mocking smile as he begins to write. “There is a lot of theoretical content, we should divide it between the two. This is more efficient and we will finish earlier.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan has risen to stand behind Shen Qingqiu to look over his shoulder at what he is writing. There are three columns on the paper. The first says </span>
<em>
<span>Shen Yuan</span>
</em>
<span> and it is what he will have to do. The third is </span>
<em>
<span>Shen Qingqiu </span>
</em>
<span>and it is what they will present to the rest of the sect.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The second says </span>
<em>
<span>Shen Jiu</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shen Jiu?” He mutters, confused.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu nods as he writes down what he will do under the second column.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was my name before I became Shen Qingqiu.”</span>

<p>Shen Jiu can't hide his impatience. Although he has told himself that he has no special interest in those classes, his name will be affected and that makes him uncomfortable. Even though he and Shen Yuan have been talking for days, researching and documenting, Shen Jiu is still concerned if it’s insufficient.</p><p>The silence of the bamboo house is suffocating, allowing his worst thoughts to escape his control with nothing to distract him.</p><p>When the door finally opens, Shen Jiu gets up, forgetting the meticulous mastery of his gestures. Luckily, he recovers quickly and when Shen Yuan enters, Shen Jiu has already regained his control even though he is still anxious.</p><p>Shen Yuan, on the other hand, is terrible at hiding his emotions. He smiles and his eyes shine, that means everything went well, right?</p><p>“Tell me,” Shen Jiu demands as he urges him to sit at that table that already has space for two. It is more comfortable since now they spend a lot of time arguing at that table or eating together. “What did Mu Qingfang tell you?”</p><p>“He loved the idea!”</p><p>Shen Jiu raises an eyebrow. Over time he has learned that Shen Yuan is not stupid and his ideas are curious, but unfortunately, he is too naive and tends to soften reality.</p><p>“I want a detailed summary of exactly what he told you and what you have talked about.”</p><p>Shen Yuan sighs, his lips twisted into a pout. Shen Jiu also knows that his motivation is fickle: he prepares projects with all his enthusiasm, but only if they excite him. He is quite lazy and that irritates him.</p><p>“Well, I had to wait a bit because Mu Qingfang was busy with his disciples. Although when he has seen me, he has come to talk to me right away. He asked me about your wound, by the way.”</p><p>Shen Jiu nods. Not even a scar remains from that incident. As he repeated until he was bored: it was nothing. Still, Mu Qingfang's interest leaves him an uneasy feeling. Why does the renowned sect healer worry about a minor injury?</p><p>“Then, I told him about our plan. The truth is that... It was very easy to convince him. I didn't even have to tell him the speech you forced me to memorize.” He adds the last with mischievousness, reminding him of the brief discussion they had had: Shen Yuan defended improvisation while Shen Jiu didn’t intend to allow him to leave the house until he knew everything they had talked about by heart.</p><p>Of course, Shen Jiu had won the argument.</p><p>“Did you know that Mu Qingfang already teaches basic notions of dual cultivation to his disciples?” </p><p>Shen Yuan was whispering and Shen Jiu leaned down to hear the gossip.</p><p>“No.” He acknowledges with genuine surprise. “But it makes sense. It is another medical resource, after all.”</p><p>“And some good arguments for when we propose it to the rest of Peak Lords!” Shen Yuan grins. There is a malicious glint in his eyes and for once Shen Jiu responds to his smile. “First, Mu Qingfang recognizes that dual cultivation has healing purposes. Second, Qian Cao Peak's disciples have already received classes similar to the ones we want to propose. Third, we are now two and no one will be able to accuse the good Mu Qingfang of being a pervert.” Shen Yuan pauses. “Two and a half, I guess.”</p><p><em> Two and a half, </em>he thinks, nodding.</p><p>Shen Jiu immediately tries to ignore that thought.</p><p>“Has he told you anything else?”</p><p>“Mu Qingfang has no problem taking over technical classes. He has also offered to help us with the glossary of the most common plants that cause sex pollen and how to recognize them or prepare an alternative antidote to papapa...”</p><p>“Shen Yuan!” He scolds him, sick of hearing that ridiculous word.</p><p>“Hem! He is quite friendly, did you know? I thought it would be much more embarrassing to talk to him, but Mu Qingfang has very clear ideas. We can count on him, not only to defend the proposal before the rest but also to organize the content of the classes.”</p><p>“Guess you are right,” he mutters. Although Shen Jiu doesn't get along with any of his martial brothers, perhaps Mu Qingfang is the one he has a better relationship with. It is a superficial but temperate relationship, without the veiled tensions that it has with the rest. </p><p>Maybe that‘s the reason why he doesn’t feel his usual jealousy or fear of being replaced by Shen Yuan, who is much more cordial, friendly and cheerful than him.</p><p>“Now that we have Mu Qingfang's support and knowledge, it is time to move on to the next phase of the plan,” he decides.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Even though Shen Qingqiu had been avoiding Peak Lords' meetings all this time, he had decided to present the proposal during the next one. Shen Yuan understands his reasoning and he is partly relieved that the real Shen Qingqiu took care of the most complicated part, but waiting locked in the bamboo house while the nerves eat inside him isn't pleasant.</p><p>Bored and stressed, Shen Yuan is unable to stay still. He has already walked a thousand times inside his room like a trapped animal and is now walking through the entirety of the bamboo house. He has mixed feelings about that place. First, it was a possible new home after he died. Then, a prison. Now... he doesn't know. It's still stressful spending so much time indoors, but in his past life he didn't leave his home much either and at least he has managed to turn his room into a refuge.</p><p>Shen Yuan stops at realizing that the second room has turned into<em> his room </em>. Not a cell, not a place without emotional value. It is a refuge that he has begun to decorate according to his tastes and where he always hides despite having the house to himself. The rest belongs to Shen Qingqiu, but that room is his.</p><p>Shen Yuan doesn't know how to feel about it.</p><p>His gaze stops on the table, where is the paper with the three columns. Shen Qingqiu is the name of the horrible character that Shen Yuan hates, while Shen Jiu seems the name of a third person. He no longer knows who he is living with. Shen Qingqiu is the terrible monster who committed so many atrocities in PIDW, but after raising doubts and questions, Shen Yuan begins to suspect that Shen Jiu is the real person.</p><p>Shen Yuan also doesn't know how to feel about it.</p><p>He startles when the door finally opens. Shen Qingqiu (or Shen Jiu?) walks in with his usual grace. His expression doesn't reflect anything, although Shen Yuan already knows him well enough to guess when he's upset. And today he doesn't seem pissed.</p><p>But he doesn't seem happy either, and his silence only makes him even tenser.</p><p>“How has it been!?” He exclaims.</p><p>“Wait.” Shen Qingqiu ignores him to close the door. “The disciples can hear you.”</p><p>Closing the door also activates the silence spells that protect their secret.</p><p>Shen Yuan chases Shen Qingqiu like a chick towards the table. He was more sincere! While he waits for answers, Shen Yuan takes notice of Shen Qingqiu's actions. He doesn't seem angry, rather excited. The sparkle in his eyes is definitely malicious and he almost smiles. Shen Yuan sighs, although inside he is still nervous.</p><p>“It went well, you can relax,” Shen Qingqiu growls as he sits down in front of the table. Although they have never talked about it, the two always sit in the same position. <em> Their </em>position. “Do you want the details?”</p><p>“Of course!” Shen Yuan protests.</p><p>That subject has kept him restless and stressed for too many days, in which he has had some horrific nightmares inspired by the book, has almost written an entire bestiary with just the monsters involved in the sex pollen and has had to endure Shen Everything Has To Be Perfect Qingqiu’s hysteria. He no longer has the patience for the scum villain to torture him like that.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu is a true antagonist because he lets out a laugh. It is a light laugh that he tries to hide behind the fan, sincere, the typical laugh that doesn't fit in someone like him.</p><p>“The meeting was as boring and pointless as ever, so I interrupted before the others fell asleep to propose our new educational plan.”</p><p>“Let me guess: it stopped being boring.”</p><p>“Yes.” Shen Qingqiu's eyes sparkle with malice. “They all had pretty strong opinions. Your cute Liu Qingge, for example. Or Qi Qingqi. I wish you could have seen their faces when Mu Qingfang stepped in to support us.”</p><p>This time Shen Yuan didn't imagine it: Shen Qingqiu is smiling behind the fan. It's a crooked smirk, ideal for a cruel villain detailing his evil plan. Only this time, the villain is defending sex ed.</p><p>It is all so absurd that he is unable to hold a laugh.</p><p>“I guess they freaked out,” laughs.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu fans himself without hiding his pride, not so much because of the idea they espouse, but because of the opportunity to leave the rest of his enemies speechless. Shen Yuan stops laughing as he remembers that they will need the support of the rest of Peak Lords to prevent a future in the Water Prison.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu's enmity with the rest of the Cang Qiong Sect is no longer so funny.</p><p>“Absolutely,” Shen Qingqiu smirks. “They have made the mistake of trying to argue with Mu Qingfang. You should never do it. Mu Qingfang is the only person who can calmly listen while they yell at him and then refute all of their arguments coherently and without losing his calm. He has destroyed them.”</p><p>Shen Yuan acknowledges that that would have been fun to watch, although he struggles to smile again. In the end, he decides to postpone that problem for later and focus on sex education classes.</p><p>“And the others?”</p><p>“They don’t have an opinion as intense as theirs. It has been as we expected: Yue Qingyuan considers it a magnificent idea, Shang Qinghua is too coward to refuse...”</p><p>Shen Yuan frowns as he speaks. Perhaps he is already being too suspicious, but PIDW always made it clear that Shen Qingqiu was taking advantage of the sect leader's favoritism to do evil things. However, Shen Qingqiu has mentioned Yue Qingyuan with bitter sarcasm. Shen Yuan shakes his head and tries to forget it.</p><p>“So, we are the majority, right?”</p><p>“Yes, our proposal has been approved, however...” Shen Qingqiu snorts while grimacing. “Each Peak Lord will decide whether to impart them or not. Bai Zhan Peak and Xian Shu Peak have already refused and I suspect that perhaps other peaks will look for cowardly excuses to sneak out.”</p><p>For Shen Yuan, that’s a bittersweet victory. At least Luo Binghe will receive the classes, he is the one who needs them the most, but in Xian Shu Peak there is one of his main wives. Besides, Shen Yuan is concerned about everyone's general safety.</p><p>“Maybe if I spoke to Liu Qingge like the last...”</p><p>His words are interrupted by Luo Binghe's familiar yells.</p><p>“Liu-shishu! Shizun hates being bothered! Wait here and I'll announce you to him! Liu-shishu, shizun will be angry if you enter his house without warning!”</p><p><em> What a coincidence </em>, Shen Yuan thinks, amused, as Shen Qingqiu pales. The two look at each other.</p><p>“How do we do it? Rock, paper, or scissors?”</p><p>“What?” Shen Qingqiu frowns in confusion.</p><p>“Nothing, a game.”</p><p>“We don't have time for silly games,” he says as he gets up to hide in Shen Yuan's room. “Deal with him, I've had enough of his nonsense for today.”</p><p>Shen Yuan collects the incriminating evidence while waiting for Liu Qingge's imminent arrival. He silently thanks Luo Binghe for taking the role of their watchdog so seriously. <em> Later I will tell Shen Qingqiu that he deserves a reward </em>, he muses. Luo Binghe's screams betray Liu Qingge's presence and that’s why Shen Yuan is not startled when the War God opens the door with a kick.</p><p>“Shen Qingqiu!!” He yells, followed by the loyal shadow of Luo Binghe, who looks at his shizun with regret.</p><p>“Hi, shidi.” Shen Yuan forces himself to draw his coldest grin. That’s a bad moment, they have already argued and on top of that Liu Qingge has ignored his disciple to enter rudely. He deserves all the antipathy of the original Shen Qingqiu, even though Shen Yuan finds it amusing. “Thanks, Luo Binghe. You have done a good job, too bad your shishu is too impulsive. Now, leave us.”</p><p>Shen Yuan seems to hear a muffled noise, perhaps Shen Qingqiu is applauding his performance, perhaps Shen Qingqiu is upset that he congratulated Luo Binghe on a failed assignment. Both options are possible. Luo Binghe bows before leaving. At the door, the young man gives Liu Qingge a dark and sour look.</p><p>“Well, shidi?” Shen Yuan raises the fan. That makes it easier to speak without fear that his expression will betray him. “You don’t listen to my disciple, haven’t you listened to me in the meeting either and that is why you are now so interested in talking to me?”</p><p>A deep red covers Liu Qingge's cheeks.</p><p>“Shen Qingqiu, your shameless,” he splutters. “I thought you had changed, but now you intend for your disciples to visit brothels too!”</p><p>“I'm pretty sure I didn't say that.”</p><p>Although Shen Yuan hasn’t been in the meeting, he knows with an inexplicable certainty that Shen Qingqiu would never ruin their proposal with such foolishness. Unable to help it, he squints and watches Liu Qingge, remembering when Shen Qingqiu confessed that he was the reason for all his rumors. Rumors that Shen Yuan no longer knows if they are entirely true.</p><p>“Shidi, I understand that you have complaints. And I am willing to discuss our different points of view, but I won’t tolerate you making up any more lies.”</p><p>Liu Qingge crosses his arms, growling through his teeth.</p><p>“Why do you want children to learn dual cultivation? Sex harms cultivation.”</p><p>“First, dual cultivation it’s not papapa...” A noise is heard in the next room. “Hem, it’s not common sex. Haven't you heard Mu Qingfang's explanation either? It is a valid technique that can enhance cultivation if it’s practiced with a cultivation partner and can also be used medically in some specific cases.”</p><p>“They are too young to look for a cultivation partner!”</p><p>“I know, but answering your first question: there are many dangers out there that can lead to a papa... fuck or die situation.”</p><p>“That is an exaggeration. I have survived these situations with only willpower.”</p><p><em> Really, Liu-shidi??? </em>Shen Yuan blinks, between surprised and on the verge of laughing. He would never have imagined that Liu Qingge would be so... stubbornly pure.</p><p>“Okay, but you have a special talent, shidi. People with weaker cultivation can end up in a dangerous situation. Our goal is not to teach papa ... sex, but also to explain the most common dangers to prevent them.” <em> Fuck! I hope Liu Qingge thinks the "our" is for Mu Qingfang. </em>Shen Yuan clears his throat before grinning at him and thus diverting attention from his slip. “Maybe you object because Bai Zhan Peak doesn't like to study?”</p><p>“Shen Qingqiu!!”</p><p>Fortunately, Liu Qingge screams, because Shen Yuan could clearly hear a giggle from his room.</p><p>“If not, I don't understand why you oppose us teaching them how to avoid poisonous plants and monster secretions.”</p><p>An even more intense blush covers Liu Qingge's face down to his ears. He clenches his fists as he looks away, fleeing from Shen Yuan's gaze.</p><p>“Teaching that is fine,” he growls under his breath. “Not the other.”</p><p>“Why n...” Shen Yuan tenses upon hearing a dry noise in his room. In a hurry, he coughs to attract Liu Qingge’s attention, who has frowned. “Hem, why no…?” Another noise. One can be chance, two is intentional. Shen Yuan stands up. “Excuse me, shidi. I think I have left a window open...”</p><p>He runs up to his room, with all the calm he can maintain in such a stressful situation and opens the door minimum so that Liu Qingge doesn‘t see anything. Nor anyone.</p><p>“What are you doing?” He hisses with a whisper.</p><p>Shen Qingqiiu pushes him away from the door and grabs his fan.</p><p>“I want to talk with him.”</p><p>After the exchange, Shen Yuan leans against the door to listen to the conversation between the two immortals. First, he hears footsteps. Then, the rustle of the fabric when someone sits down. Shen Yuan gulps and silently prays that Liu Qingge doesn't discover the little differences between their hairstyles and robes.</p><p>“Liu Qingge, I'll be frank with you: why are you against disciples learning about safe practices and respect? I am not interested in promoting dual cultivation, but it is a possibility that can occur and they should know how to act.” Shen Yuan seems to hear Liu Qingge try to reply, but Shen Qingqiu interrupts him. “You have always lived in your own world. Yes, you are filthy talented and have cultivated to perfection at a young age. Congratulations!! But not everyone is like you.”</p><p>“You would have my level if you hadn't damaged your cultivation by going to those brothels...”</p><p>“But we aren’t talking about me! What's your problem with us teaching these subjects at Qing Jing Peak? I'm not going to force you to make your hopeless brutes study a glossary of poisonous plants, but you can't force me to not do it with mine either.” Shen Qingqiu is raising his tone of voice and Shen Yuan recognizes the moment when his anger is born. “You haven’t listened to me at the meeting, you have come here with the wrong conclusions, and you keep talking nonsense. Your problem is that you despise me. That's the truth. You've been despising me since we were disciples. Liu Qingge, never forget that right now we are the same, despite our cultivation differences.”</p><p>“I...”</p><p>Shen Yuan is sorry for Liu Qingge, knowing how terrible Shen Qingqiu's anger is, although his curiosity continues to grow as he wonders what kind of history those two have had in the past.</p><p>“Let me add one last thing: I only intend to give them the necessary knowledge. If they end up in a humiliating situation for not studying, it will be their fault for their stupidity.” Shen Yuan sighs. That lack of empathy is typical of the scum villain. “However, thanks to spending so much time in brothels I know the horrible things that can happen. Things that you have never considered. That is really what I am interested in explaining in these classes.”</p><p>Shen Yuan hears that Shen Qingqiu rises again, leaving Liu Qingge speechless. Nor explain his erratic behavior. <em> They're going to find us out because of you </em>, he laments. However, Shen Yuan steps away from the door for Shen Qingqiu to re-enter the room and exchange again.</p><p>“Shen Qingqiu?” Liu Qingge mutters, visibly confused. He too has gotten up and looked about to head to the exit.</p><p>“I forgot to tell you one thing,” he improvises, trying very hard to imitate the same cold furious tone as Shen Qingqiu. “Mn… Respect my door!”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Shen Yuan is not thinking. Shen Yuan has to justify Shen Qingqiu's dramatic departure after blurting out his speech.</p><p>“Don't come back so suddenly and listen to my disciples. Please.” Behind his back, Shen Yuan hears an annoyed snort. “And go talk to Mu-shidi if you still have doubts! You listen to him, right?“</p><p>Shen Yuan is trying to imitate Shen Qingqiu's presumptuous arrogance, but it's difficult when Liu Qingge looks at him with that beaten-up puppy face. After all, he is only slightly offended, while Shen Qingqiu seems to carry an old and very specific rage. </p><p>Instead of leaving, Liu Qingge remained still, his gaze lowered and his fists clenched. He's... tense. And maybe confused. Shen Yuan waits as he fans himself to unsuccessfully hide his nervousness from him.</p><p>“I've never seen it that way,” he mutters. Shen Yuan is learning that Liu Qingge never runs away when something bothers him, but he also doesn't speak with his usual confidence. "Sorry."</p><p>Shen Yuan seems to hear that Shen Qingqiu has gasped behind the door, so he clears his throat to mask the noise. Although he doesn’t need those apologies, the hidden person, Shen Yuan appreciates that very peculiar courage of acknowledging a mistake out loud.</p><p>“See, shidi? We can solve many misunderstandings by talking,” he teases him and Liu Qingge looks away, blushing. “I appreciate your apology...”</p><p>Now they hear a sharp, cutting thump, impossible to ignore, surely from a bestiary hitting the ground. Liu Qingge raises his head with a frown as Shen Yuan smiles nervously.</p><p>“It’s everything fine?”</p><p>“The wind, don’t worry. As I was saying, I really appreciate that we talk and solve our misunderstandings, like the incident with our disciples or today...”</p><p>Another intense hit, maybe two or three manuals this time. Shen Yuan smiles, even more, feigning indifference. This is a golden opportunity to increase the affection of one of the Peak Lords for Shen Qingqiu! Also, he is one of the most powerful cultivators! Shen Yuan is ready to face the wrath of the scum villain later.</p><p>“Hem,” he clears his throat. “I appreciate you apologizing, shidi. And I hope we continue to talk as we have done now.” Shen Yuan doesn't even blink when the <em> wind </em>keeps throwing things to the ground as a warning.</p><p>Liu Qingge seems more and more confused.</p><p>“Maybe you should look...?”</p><p>“Everything is fine, shidi!”</p><p>“Sure? If you have a hole in the wall, I can help you.” Liu Qingge lowers his gaze, again whispering. “As an apology...”</p><p>“No need, shidi!” Shen Yuan knows that he is acting very OC, but he is not in a situation that allows him to think calmly. “If you want to apologize, stop spreading rumors about me.”</p><p>“Stop going to brothels.”</p><p><em> Why does this subject bother him so much? </em>He cries internally.</p><p>“Liu-shidi.” Shen Yuan tries to imitate the seriousness of the original Shen Qingqiu. “Have you ever considered that there is another reason why I visit brothels? Look!” He gestures to encompass the entire room. “I am picky. I hate clutter and I never leave my house with disheveled clothes or wrinkles.” Perhaps Shen Yuan is exaggerating so that the <em> wind </em>listens to him and stops playing the fool. And give him a break, Shen Qingqiu's standards are impossible. “I don't like my disciples getting too close to me and neither do the Peak Lords gatherings. Yes, shidi, you made me feel uncomfortable during the other night hunt because you didn't give me space to breathe. Do you really think I'm going to find that kind of company in a brothel?”</p><p>Although Liu Qingge opens his mouth, he doesn't say anything. He takes a deep breath before leaving. Only when the door closes, Shen Yuan can finally calm down. Then another door opens and he tenses again.</p><p>“Sorry!” He exclaims. “Why did you leave without any explanation? I just wanted to cover us up and I've talked too much! But you have to make peace with Liu Qingge! It is very important for the future! And I really think that nothing happens if one day the clothes aren’t perfect!”</p><p>Shen Yuan mutes upon discovering that he is mindlessly babbling while Shen Qingqiu doesn't even seem to be listening to him. Or angry. Although he has frowned, his expression is strange.</p><p>“Is that what you think about me?”</p><p>“Mn?”</p><p>“About the brothels.”</p><p>“Dunno? I don't know what you're doing there and I don't know if I want to know,” he blushes, thinking about… “Only that I have the impression that you are not only looking for papapa?”</p><p>Shen Qingqiu continues to stare at him with that strange fixation as if trying to catch Shen Yuan's thoughts. He was so sure that he would have been angry that his silence is even more uncomfortable. Because that expression is not from Shen Qingqiu, but that <em> Shen Jiu </em> that he barely knows.</p><p>“Copy the rules of etiquette and courtesy from Qing Jing Peak. Fifty times.”</p><p>“What?” He babbles.</p><p>“And stop messing with my private life.”</p><p>Shen Qingqiu walks past his side intending to ignore him, but that is a very small place and they have nowhere to run.</p>

<p>
<span>Luo Binghe is very excited about the new classes that shizun has organized. They are special for different reasons: they will learn many things, they will visit other peaks, and they will also have other teachers. Luo Binghe loves when shizun takes them to the other peaks, like when they learned about medicinal plants at Qian Cao Peak, although shizun is the best teacher of all. But perhaps Luo Binghe is also excited by a very particular curiosity... and quite widespread among his martial brothers, who laugh softly at the thought of dual cultivation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu had explained to them that these classes will last several days and that they would cover various sections, explained by different Peak Lords. Their first lesson is at Qing Jing Peak and they share it with the disciples of Bai Zhan Peak. Luo Binghe didn’t expect to see Bai Zhan Peak's disciples after Liu Qingge stormed furiously into the bamboo house without manners. However, his disciples have come and sat on the grass with the ones from Qing Jing Peak. Although the two are starting to get along better after the previous night hunt, they don't mix. Both have sat divided into two very clearly groups.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe sits between Ning Yingying and Ming Fan, who is squinting at the disciples from Bai Zhan Peak. Luo Binghe understands his suspicion: until recently, those savages always made fun of his shizun.</span>
</p><p>
<span>All the disciples whisper with hardly any exceptions. There is a lot of curiosity and interest, also a few jokes that make Ning Yingying and Luo Binghe blush, while Ming Fan snorts at the bad taste of some. The expectation is such that there is no silence when Shen Qingqiu arrives.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe examines Shizun's clothes and hairstyle, the elegance of his steps, and all those little gestures that reveal whether there will be smiles or reproaches that morning. Shen Qingqiu scrutinizes the disciples, his expression still hidden behind the fan. As there are so many, the class will be in the open air, near to the bamboo forest. Shen Qingqiu carries several books and Liu Qingge, who was with his arms crossed watching his disciples, comes over to help him. There is nothing intimate or special about that gesture, but Luo Binghe gets very nervous when he sees it. And he doesn't understand why.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Silence,” Shen Qingqiu asks and automatically everyone, even the brutes from Bai Zhan Peak, shut up. There is an expectant silence and all eyes are on that elegant figure dressed in green. “We will begin these lessons by studying the most common causes of poisoning. Tomorrow you will visit Mu Qingfang who will talk to you about plants and their pollen. Today I will explain to you what kind of monsters and demons can corner you in a papapa situation.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Papapa? </span>
</em>
<span>Luo Binghe thinks. He is not the only one. Even Liu Qingge has frowned and looks strangely at Shen Qingqiu, who has become paralyzed. Not even his fan can hide the blush that stains his cheeks.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>A few days later.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan would never have imagined that his proposed sex ed classes would turn into some kind of multi-day event that is hitting multiple peaks. It's fun. That reminds him of college exchange programs. Happy, Shen Yuan hums as he consults a manual. He is also learning many things: in PIDW almost all situations were solved with papapa, but Mu Qingfang has taught him different antidotes for less aggressive poisons. In front of him, Shen Qingqiu is writing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The bamboo house is surrounded by a pleasant silence. Also, it's a sunny day and Shen Yuan begins to stretch like a cat, although every time he neglects his posture, Shen Qingqiu gives him a warning hiss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At times, they can also hear the laughter of the disciples and the echo of their voices.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How many papapa plants have you memorized?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“24!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I never imagined that so many plants could cause papapa.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu puts the brush down hard on the table and gives Shen Yuan an angry look and he trembles in terror.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I'll kill you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You already punished me by copying the poison manual two hundred times!” Manual that they then gave to the different disciples so they could use it as a reference. At least Shen Yuan's suffering wasn’t in vain. “Besides, It was you who said it, not me!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu blushes as he remembers HIS slip. Shen Yuan regrets not being able to be present to see how the proud and arrogant scum villain said out loud </span>
<em>
<span>papapa </span>
</em>
<span>in front of a bunch of teenagers and the even prouder Liu Qingge. He smiles at the thought and Shen Qingqiu lets out another growl as he tries to focus on his writing. His attitude is simple: ignore what has happened as if it is going to disappear from everyone's memory.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Shen Yuan never plans to forget it. This is one of his best memories in this world.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m leaving,” Shen Jiu alerts Shen Yuan as he heads towards the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He wouldn’t have to say anything to him, to that usurper, to that double who could be a spy, a demon, or a threat, but Shen Jiu feels that he shouldn’t leave without saying goodbye. It's stupid, he'll be back a few hours later, but…</span>
</p><p><span>Something changed. Shen Jiu doesn't know exactly what it is, only that his life is no longer the same. And not only because there is another person in his house, nor that they live together, but there’s a change within him.</span> <span>Shen Jiu was aware since the day Liu Qingge came with his stupid prejudices to argue with him. Shen Yuan did something strange, something that no one else had done before, not even Yue Qingyuan and his empty words: he defended him.</span></p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan is perhaps the first person who has tried to understand his decisions instead of assuming things like everyone else.</span>
</p><p>
<span>On the way to An Ding Peak, Shen Jiu thinks of the Warm Red Pavillion. It has been a long time since he last visited those women. Maybe he should come over one afternoon, perhaps only to talk to them and make sure they are fine. Sometimes he still forgets that Shen Yuan has already stolen three years of his life.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The dual cultivation classes had been more successful than he had imagined. In his pessimism, Shen Jiu had accepted that they would only perform them at Qing Jing Peak and Qian Cao Peak, perhaps also Qiong Ding Peak, but after their discussion, Liu Qingge had agreed on the condition of being present. Although Shen Jiu suspects that it is because he would talk about monsters. However, the rest of the peaks are cheering up. To Shen Jiu's surprise, the cowardly Shang Qinghua had been the next to join.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu has always visited An Ding Peak to complain or demand that Liu Qingge's damage be repaired. It is the first time that he is there to teach. Shang Qinghua greets him as nervous as ever. Shen Jiu has never understood why he is the most criticized of all the Peak Lords when Shang Qinghua is more cowardly than a rat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shen-shixiong!” He greets him with a trembling, piping voice. Shang Qinghua is as scared as ever and Shen Jiu sighs without understanding his decision. “Over here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They walk the main An Ding Peak trail together. Shen Jiu fans lazily, trying to ignore the nervousness which Shang Qinghua rubs his hands. Ever since he met him, Shang Qinghua has always been a pathetic parody of a distinguished cultivator. How he became Peak Lord is a mystery. However, he is more nervous than usual. Dual cultivation has the power to affect everyone and make them irrational. Some get angry, others pale and some even get scared.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shang Qinghua clears his throat as they are about to enter the building.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My disciples are very excited to learn from Shen-shixiong the... What did you call it? Papapa?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu stops to give him a glacier look. Shang Qinghua pales a little but holds his gaze with determination.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don't ever say that word in my presence again,” he hisses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I won’t do it! Sorry!” Still, he seems neither regretful or intend to let him pass. “May I ask Shen-shixiong about his sudden interest in dual cultivation?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Have you perhaps read a book that has changed your opinion? Proud Immortal Demon Way?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu frowns, not softening his annoyed gaze, though inside he's starting to run out of air. It’s happening. Someone suspects them. And from Shang Qinghua's words, he suspects that perhaps a demon is usurping the real Shen Qingqiu. If it weren't for the fact that he has to assuage his suspicions, Shen Jiu would laugh at the irony. But it is not ironic or funny, but pitifully sad.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not his sect or the Peak Lords (they also hadn't had a good relationship before), not his disciples (perhaps too young), not even Yue Qingyuan (his Qi-ge) or Liu Qingge (after so many discussions they shouldn't have a special enmity relationship?). The only person who has noticed Shen Yuan's shadow is the insubstantial coward Shang Qinghua.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That hurts. Shen Jiu takes a deep breath as he tries to maintain control. That is no longer a class, but a trap. And he has to act as normally as possible before Shang Qinghua decides to accuse him of being a spy for demons. After all, they still haven't discovered who leaked the information allowing the demonic invasion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With his fame and records, with his many enemies, no one will believe Shen Qingqiu if he is betrayed by a rat like Shang Qinghua. Then he will have to reveal the truth about Shen Yuan and he is not prepared to face a future in which everyone he knows chooses that most pleasant and optimistic version of himself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although Shen Jiu begins to feel like he is drowning in his fears, his expression remains nonchalant.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu isn't the only one who has been thinking about the brothel discussion: Liu Qingge too. That’s the reason why he has gone down to the city with his sister and they are both walking towards Warm Red Pavillion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s be clear: do you want me to question prostitutes about what Shen-shibo does or does not do with them?“ There is a mischievous glint in Liu Mingyan's eyes that makes Liu Qingge blush.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I just want to know the truth,” Liu Qingge splutters. “He is acting weird. Sometimes he looks like two completely different people.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And finding out about his adventures with the prostitutes will surely clear up your doubts, hm.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Mingyan's words make him feel uncomfortable. When she speaks, he understands a little how illogical his decision is. However, for some reason, he can't stop thinking about that conversation. Why does Shen Qingqiu visit the Warm Red Pavilion? Is there another reason apart from the obvious one? Why does that worry him so much?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don't have to do it if you don't want to,” he mutters, still uneasy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Mingyan lets out an amused laugh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don't worry, dage! I'll help you, but I'd like to know more about your... new interest in Shen-shibo. Although it is not very new either.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge has asked Liu Mingyan for help in a desperate act, as several years ago he was expelled for life from the Warm Red Pavilion after provoking several fights with Shen Qingqiu. If it weren't for that prohibition, he would have gone to ask himself. Liu Mingyan is supposedly a more subtle option, but he's starting to rethink it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No interest, just concern.” He crosses his arms, ignoring his sister's insightful gaze. “He is acting weird. Rarer than usual.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe you should leave him alone? You're always complaining about him. I don't think your relationship will improve if you continue like this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That's the point: it's getting better. He...” Liu Qingge gulps, embarrassed at the thought of his qi deviation. And how Shen Qingqiu saved his life. “I am indebted to him. A debt of a lifetime.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don't seem to hate being in debt to your worst enemy,” Liu Mingyan points out maliciously.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Because since then he has changed! He talks to me and tries to reach agreements. Maybe I was wrong?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge has always trusted his instincts. That is why he is terrified that he has wronged Shen Qingqiu. The same one that saved his life. The same one who never fights fair, who is smug and lazy, who started cultivating too late. The same one who protected the disciples the other night, ending up wounded. The same one who tried to stab him in the back and once promised he would kill him. The same…</span>
</p><p>
<span>He is no longer sure. The only certain thing is that he saved his life.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Mingyan's laugh sounds like bells.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I'm glad you two are getting along. After all, you've always had that obsession with him...”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mingyan!” He scolds her, stunned to hear those shameful words from his little sister's mouth, a pink tinge appearing on Liu Qingge’s cheeks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What? It’s true!” She scoffs. “You only talked about Shen-shibo!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They were complaints!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So what? You never talk about your disciples or your friends... Do you even have friends? It has always been Shen-shibo. First you complain because he bothers you. And now you complain because he doesn't bother you so much anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge stops in the middle of the street. Maybe his sister is right and his interest is because he wants to be friends with Shen Qingqiu? That would explain why he thinks so much about him. And gets worried whenever he is hurt. Liu Qingge believed that it was because of the debt, but that didn’t explain the need to gift him a fan or how he rejoices whenever he sees Shen Qingqiu use it. Nor why does he have the urge to impress him with a monster or to propose a night hunt together when he used to hate them before. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I want to be his friend</span>
</em>
<span>, he understands (wrongly).</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Mingyan gives him a subtle nudge. When Liu Qingge raises his head, he discovers Shen Qingqiu on the street. They both look at each other in awkward silence. They are too close to the Warm Red Pavilion. Liu Qingge can feign ignorance, after all, what would he do going to the Warm Red Pavilion with his little sister? It's stupid! However, Shen Qingqiu's presence is not so absurd and it also reminds him of the discussion they had.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, shidi,” Shen Qingqiu purrs, although there is something dangerous hidden in his voice. Liu Qingge feels a chill upon hearing him. “What are you doing here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Walk. Accompany Mingyan.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>He can perfectly notice how his sister rolls her eyes at his improvisational skills.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hm.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu's gaze has always been suspicious and that day is no exception. He is always frowning as if he sees the worst in the world and people. Fortunately, he also has to understand how ridiculous it’s to imagine Liu Qingge heading to the Warm Red Pavilion with his little sister. However, now he has an even worse problem: Shen Qingqiu is clearly going to the Warm Red Pavilion. If it was already difficult for Liu Mingyan to ask questions without arousing suspicion, now it will be impossible.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He needs a new plan. He needs to get Shen Qingqiu away from the brothels while Liu Mingyan investigates.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come with me,” he babbles and Shen Qingqiu squints suspiciously. Liu Qingge definitely hates improvising and anything that doesn't involve a sword. “I bothered you the other day. Let me buy you a meal. As an apology.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now Shen Qingqiu looks surprised. Liu Mingyan gives him a support slap on the back. Although her face is hidden by a veil, he knows that she is smiling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This one has pending tasks. Shen-shibo, please take care of my brother,“ she bows before leaving. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And the two of them are left alone, enveloped by an even more awkward silence. Liu Qingge waits for Shen Qingqiu's decision as he wonders how subtle it would be to carry him onto his shoulder and go away if he decides to continue to the Warm Red Pavilion. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Do you have a place in mind?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>His question surprises him. And it also makes him happy. It’s another proof that Shen Qingqiu is changing to be a nicer person.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mn, there is a place that I always go to with Liu Mingyan. She likes it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge only knows how to recognize weapons and talent, food is indifferent to him, so he trusts his sister's judgment. Shen Qingqiu nods and walks to his side, waiting for him to guide him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After so many years of rivalry and arguments, it’s odd to walk alongside Shen Qingqiu without speaking. They aren’t used to silence, but rather to grunting and exchanging complaints before blows. They aren’t used to quiet, but to fight. However, Liu Qingge finds that it is okay to just walk, although he also feels nervous and impatient. He prefers silence to empty conversations or Shen Qingqiu's malice, so he doesn't try to start a conversation either.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Perhaps he could get used to that new relationship with Shen Qingqiu.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Perhaps... he wants to improve his relationship with Shen Qingqiu.</span>

<p>There is an unwritten rule that ensures that in Shen Jiu's fate nothing turns out as he expected.</p><p>After a stressful morning dispelling Shang Qinghua's suspicions, he needs the comfort of the prostitutes at the Warm Red Pavilion. However, he has had to run into a thousand times inopportune Liu Qingge and his sister. To his surprise, instead of reproaching his obvious intention to go to a brothel, Liu Qingge has invited him for a meal. Perhaps he still hadn't realized his intentions. Liu Qingge is as blunt as innocent, so Shen Jiu agrees to avoid another of his speeches. And maybe that's a good chance to understand better what he's thinking and why he's acting so strange lately.</p><p>The two walk with no intention of breaking the silence. Hiding behind his fan, Shen Jiu watches over Liu Qingge. He's as proud as ever, moving with that battlefield arrogance that doesn't fit in the streets of a normal city. There is nothing wrong with him, but since Shen Yuan's arrival, he has been acting weird. And that worries him because his new attitude is sticky and suffocating, plus he already has had several opportunities to discover them.</p><p>Perhaps Shen Jiu should listen to Shen Yuan's proposals to compensate Luo Binghe for his guard dog activities. To his misfortune, their secret persists thanks to that irritating teenager.</p><p>Liu Qingge stops when he reaches a nice-looking local. It is a quiet place surrounded by a sweet aroma. It doesn't seem like a site that someone like the War God would visit regularly and that idea makes Shen Jiu laugh maliciously. However, Liu Qingge knows where to go and even the best table, set apart from the rest in a quiet corner.</p><p>“Wow, shidi,” he says when they sit down. “Your tastes continue to surprise me.”</p><p>“Mingyan,” he comments as an explanation.</p><p>That fits with what he knows about his detached personality, although Shen Jiu has another theory: good taste is part of the flesh of a rich boy like him. It’s another instinct, as his ability to fight. That irritates him. Shen Jiu has worked very hard to create the image of Shen Qingqiu and Liu Qingge, completely indifferent to social conventions, achieves it intuitively.</p><p>Other than the promise of a meal, nothing ties them together at that moment. The silence between them grows until it becomes immense and uncomfortable. Shen Jiu sighs as he thinks of different strategies to distract Liu Qingge and return to the Warm Red Pavilion without him suspecting anything.</p><p>In front of him, Liu Qingge frowns.</p><p>“Your classes have been good,” he concedes with a grunt. “I expected them differently.”</p><p>“Let me guess: more indecent stuff and fewer monsters?”</p><p>Liu Qingge nods. And they end up again trapped by silence. Shen Jiu can't believe that Liu Qingge, the same one who is absent from all Peak Lords meetings and only wakes up when he speaks, is looking for a topic to converse with. Shen Jiu fans himself as he gazes at his shidi with different eyes.</p><p>
<em> Why have you changed so suddenly? </em>
</p><p>“Did you find any monster interesting?” Shen Jiu asks him with false indifference and without understanding why he has fallen in his game.</p><p>There is a flash of enthusiasm in Liu Qingge's eyes.</p><p>“I was surprised that there were so many poisonous monsters,” he recognizes. “But they seem weak. My disciples will be able to defeat them without problems.”</p><p>“But did you listen to me when I talked about their properties or did you just stick with the names?” Shen Jiu makes an immense effort to not roll his eyes. “The problem is not defeating them, the problem is that if you don’t defeat them correctly, they can poison you with their saliva, spikes, and other fluids.”</p><p>“That is an interesting challenge.”</p><p>“It's not a challenge, shidi!”</p><p>“It also seemed to me that you exaggerated the information,” he adds, calm and collected, using the same voice as always that he separates the world between right and wrong. “I faced succubi as a disciple and nothing happened.”</p><p>“Nothing?” He repeats, incredulous. “Have you forgotten that you later showed up at Qing Jing Peak and chased me like a maniac to fight you? You broke a wall and a guqin!”</p><p>Liu Qingge frowns, confirming Shen Jiu's worst fears: yes, he had forgotten about that incident. As usual. Liu Qingge goes through life with his sword and ambitions, pursuing his goals as the worst of calamities. It is the privilege of having the power to answer to no one (perhaps Yue Qingyuan) and that no one has ever defeated him.</p><p>Shen Jiu huffs. Their conversation dies when Liu Qingge orders the food. Since he pays and knows the place, Shen Jiu lets him choose. A few minutes later, they are served various dishes that smell good but are not as tasty as Luo Binghe's food. <em> Damn brat </em> , he thinks as he picks up his chopsticks. <em> If it weren't for Shen Yuan insisting on your glorious future, I would make you our cook and you would never touch a sword again. Nor a musical instrument </em>.</p><p>They eat in silence. Inconsistently, Shen Jiu glances at Liu Qingge. On one of those occasions, he discovers that he is doing the same. They both hang their heads and pretend that nothing has happened.</p><p>“Do you like it?“ Liu Qingge asks with a hint of uncertainty in his voice as if his opinion matters to him. Which is absurd.</p><p>“Not bad. But the food at Qing Jing Peak is better. You would be surprised by the difference.”</p><p>Liu Qingge nods and a satisfied smile almost appears on his lips.</p><p>“Another day.”</p><p><em> Wait! Did you just invite yourself to my house for dinner? </em>Shen Jiu looks at him with wide eyes, surprised at his nerve. Liu Qingge ignores his stunned gaze to distract him with another question.</p><p>“Last night hunt was good. We should repeat. For the disciples of course.”</p><p><em> Good? GOOD? </em> Shen Jiu growls silently as he continues to eat. <em> I'm not going on a trip with the brats and you again unless Yue Qingyuan begs me. </em> But Liu Qingge's eyes shine with that determination that no one had managed to quench and that he had seldom managed to blur. <em> Maybe next time Shen Yuan can go to my place... What am I thinking? I can't give Xiu Ya to him! And without my sword, others will be suspicious. And maybe it will be several nights. It is too dangerous for him. </em></p><p>Perhaps Liu Qingge could take all the disciples away? It's the perfect answer: no snooping for a few days, his peak quiet, and he and Shen Yuan could leave the house together. Shen Jiu sighs at the thought of everything that can go terribly wrong by leaving Liu Qingge in charge of so many mindless teenagers.</p><p>They finish eating, alternating between silence and a brief exchange of questions and comments that are more reminiscent of an interrogation. When they get up to leave, Shen Jiu is so eager to get away from him that he bumps into a young woman carrying a tray. Several cups of tea spilled all over him, splashing his robe and ruining his paper fan hopelessly.</p><p>“Are you fine?” Liu Qingge walks over, but he slaps him away.</p><p>At least he's smart enough to not bother him when he's so furious.</p><p>Forgetting the Warm Red Pavilion, Shen Qingqiu unsheathes Xiu Ya to fly back to the sect. The day has gone from bad to worse and when he lands on Qing Jing Peak, the first thing he does is look for Luo Binghe, who is training with Ming Fan and Ning Yingying.</p><p>“Luo Binghe!” He calls him. “Watch out for Liu Qingge to never get near the peak again.”</p><p>It is an impossible mission given how stubborn his shidi is, however, the brat's eyes shine with the intensity of all the stars in the sky and he responds with a huge smile.</p><p>“Yes, shizun!”</p><p>Of course, the day can end even worse. When Shen Jiu is about to reach his bamboo house, appears the last person he expected to see and with whom he is in no mood to ignore her reproaches: Qi Qingqi.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Qi Qingqi surprised the two of them.</p><p>Shen Yuan had considered her one of the most difficult targets in his new plan <em> How to Improve the Opinion of the Rest of Peak Lords About the Scum Villain </em>, yet she showed up at Qing Jing Peak to announce that she had been keeping an eye on his classes and was content with allowing Shen Qingqiu to explain her disciples about monsters. With her conditions, of course.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu told their conversation to Shen Yuan after venting about his stressful day while Shen Yuan reaffirmed his opinion that he was quite dramatic. Liu-shidi has invited him to eat and above he complains? The audacity!</p><p>“You will deal with Qi Qingqi and the Xian Shu Peak girls tomorrow,” he growled. “I have no patience to bear their nonsense and you also know the lesson.”</p><p>And so, Shen Yuan is enjoying a beautiful day at Qing Jing Peak followed by Luo Binghe and Ning Yingying. He has sent the rest of the teenagers to write another essay to please Shen Qingqiu and he has taken those two to receive the disciples of Xian Shu Peak. Shen Yuan chuckles at the thought that thanks to his ingenuity, he is going to gift Luo Binghe a golden moment with his two future main wives. It's time for the ships to set sail!</p><p>Since Qi Qingqi refuses to let the infamous and perverted Shen Qingqiu step on her peak, she has brought her disciples to Qing Jing Peak. Of course, she will also be present during the class and will examine him. That last part makes him a bit nervous, but Shen Yuan is willing to improve her image of Shen Qingqiu.</p><p>“Yingying, please guide the disciples. Binghe, do you see the girl with a veil? It's Qi Qingqi's head disciple, take the bestiaries to her.” </p><p>Shen Yuan hides a satisfied smile behind his fan as he watches his white lotus approach Liu Mingyan. He is a bit sorry for Liu Qingge's sister, no one can resist Luo Binghe's charming smile! They will no longer be joined by revenge against Shen Qingqiu (he wishes), so now they have a chance for a sweeter and more beautiful love to bloom<b>.</b></p><p>Shen Yuan is still keeping an eye on them as he walks to meet Qi Qingqi. Of all the Peak Lords, she is the one who scares him the most. He is not surprised that even Luo Binghe did let her live in PIDW without joining his harem.</p><p>“Greetings, shimei.” Shen Yuan knows how to be polite. Shen Qingqiu has persecuted him for several days to correct his posture and mannerisms, yet that morning he tries to be more elegant than arrogant.</p><p>She gazes at him as if searching for the seven differences between him and the original. Shen Yuan gulps, nervous that perhaps Qi Qingqi suspects their secret.</p><p>“Shizun!” Luo Binghe yells, almost crying in frustration, before a thud lands on the grass, causing the wind to shake their clothes.</p><p>Shen Yuan blinks without understanding what Liu Qingge is doing here again. </p><p>Quickly, he covers his face with the fan to not reveal his surprised expression. Liu Qingge walks towards them with his usual confidence as if his presence is as normal as the smiling girls sitting on the ground or Qi Qingqi.</p><p>“Greetings also for Liu-shidi,” he manages to say nervously. “What brings you to my peak? I am busy with Xian Shu Peak.”</p><p>Liu Qingge frowns and examines him entirely until his gaze stops on his hand. Shen Yuan trembles, beginning to suspect that this is a trap from the Peak Lords who have discovered their secret. He remains silent as Qi Qingqi greets Liu Qingge, just as shocked as he is, but far more amused by the situation. There is mockery in her voice and a malicious glint in her eyes when she mentions Liu Mingyan's name.</p><p>After answering Qi Qingqi's questions, Liu Qingge stretches out his arm towards Shen Yuan. And he hands him a fan.</p><p>A very nice fan, by the way, white with black cranes, but that still does not explain what he does there.</p><p>“Yours was ruined because of me,” he finally says. “For you.”</p><p>Shen Yuan catches it remembering Shen Qingqiu's complaints about their encounter. Although he knows that he should give it to the real Shen Qingqiu, Shen Yuan hopes he can keep it. It’s very pretty, like the other one he gave him, and Shen Qingqiu has thousands of fans.</p><p>“Thanks, shidi. I really appreciate it.” A sincere smile escapes Shen Yuan, terribly OC, but he doesn't care. His mission is to earn Affection Points with all the Peak Lords!</p><p>Liu Qingge is smiling too, so his plan is working. Now is the time to surprise Qi Qingqi with his knowledge of monsters. Turning around, he discovers that Ning Yingying and Liu Mingyan are pulling Luo Binghe's cheekbones.</p><p>(<em> "Liu-shishu and shizun make a good couple, right?" Had commented Ning Yingying cheerfully. </em></p><p>
<em> “NO!” Luo Binghe's eyes widened in horror. “Shizun doesn't want to see him! They always argue. Even shizun has personally asked me to keep Liu-shishu away.” He added the latter proudly, puffing out his chest. </em>
</p><p>
<em> The two girls laughed. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “I don't think they will argue much more. My brother wants to improve his relationship with Shen-shibo,” Liu Mingyan whispered enigmatically. “Look at them: I don't think they are going to argue much today.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “They seem so happy! Even Shizun has blushed!” </em>
</p><p>
<em> Luo Binghe had also blushed, but from a mix of envy and rage, also upon discovering how adorable his shizun was. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “I'm going to kick him out!” </em>
</p><p><em> “No, you don’t!” They laughed, prodding his cheeks to keep him still. “In any case, he will kick you out.” </em>)</p><p><em> Oh, the love of youth. </em>Shen Yuan thinks while humming. He wishes to freeze the time at that moment: Luo Binghe being an adorable white lotus enjoying his adolescent loves, Liu Qingge acting like a potential friend would, and Qi Qingqi still hadn't snarled at him with her usual sarcasm. However, Shen Yuan feels a chill as he remembers that the Alliance Conference is approaching. And, although he tries to ignore that thought, he has frost in his stomach, a bitter taste in his mouth.</p><p>Shen Yuan still hasn't dared to ask the System if he can avoid pushing Luo Binghe into the Abyss. And he won’t do it now, but later.</p><p>Instead of leaving, Ning Yingying sits down with Liu Mingyan and the other female disciples. After hesitating, Luo Binghe joins his future wives, although the boy is more tense than usual and doesn’t stop giving Liu Qingge grim looks. Shen Yuan almost laughs. <em> Don't worry, Binghe </em> . He smirks behind his fan. <em> Liu-shidi won’t be a match for your harem. You will have to earn his approval when you ask for Liu Mingyan's hand, though </em>.</p><p>Speaking about Liu Qingge, he also stays, but together with Qi Qingqi, and at times they both converse in low voices.</p><p>Shen Yuan talks to them with great enthusiasm about monsters and their poisonings. Although he has rehearsed together with Shen Qingqiu, it is the first time that he has explained it in front of other people and that makes him feel a bit nervous, but he quickly forgets the tension and ends up enjoying the lesson. The best is when he finishes and can answer the doubts of their disciples. Even though that class is not for Luo Binghe, he is the one who raises his arm the most times. Shen Yuan allows him, as he does with his usual happiness. <em> This protagonist, so interested in future papapa plots! He looks like a bun but has a stallion's heart. </em></p><p>When Qi Qingqi is gathering his female disciples to return to his peak, Liu Qingge walks over to him. Shen Yuan looks at him curiously, ignoring Luo Binghe's sour gazes and Ning Yingying and Liu Mingyan's laughter.</p><p>“This time you have told it differently,” he points as he stands next to Shen Yuan.</p><p><em> Were you actually listening, shidi? For the second time? </em> Shen Yuan blinks, stunned and speechless. <em> Fuck what Shen Qingqiu thinks, I want you by my side! You are best friend material! </em></p><p>But before making plans for the future, he first has to dispel possible suspicions. Shen Yuan plays with the fan while he smiles at him. He knows that his smiles always confuse Liu Qingge.</p><p>“It's boring to always say the same thing with the same words, don't you think Liu-shidi? So you will not be bored.”</p><p>A faint blush colors his cheeks. <em> Cute </em>, Shen Yuan thinks.</p><p>“You could have told more details about those monsters. It would have been more interesting,” he mutters without his usual complaints.</p><p>“Mn… Perhaps next time.”</p><p>Liu Qingge looks into his eyes and nods.</p><p>“Next time,” he says before turning around and leaving.</p><p>Shen Yuan doesn’t have time to conclude his strange attitude, as two disciples run towards him with affectionate intentions even though they can’t hug <em> Shen Qingqiu </em>. But he always makes an exception, so he pats Ning Yingying and Luo Binghe's heads before saying goodbye and heading back to the bamboo house.</p><p>“How has it been?” Shen Qingqiu asks him when he walks in.</p><p>Surrounded by OOC characters, Shen Yuan is increasingly aware of how rare the original Shen Qingqiu is. Of the two, he is the one who least follows the PIDW script, which is positive for their survival.</p><p>His plans have changed: now they have to survive together, as fate has tied them to the same future. Shen Yuan closes his eyes as he decides that the other will be Shen Jiu. He needs to see him as a different person instead of the character he hated so much. And in his heart, he feels that there is a difference between <em> Shen Qingqiu </em> and <em> Shen Jiu </em>.</p><p>“It has been great!”</p><p>He babbles as he finishes closing the door. His enthusiasm is real and Shen Yuan immediately forgets his doubts to tell him everything that has happened. Shen Jiu frowns upon hearing that Liu Qingge has bothered again, but Shen Yuan hands him the fan before he complains again.</p><p>“He wanted to apologize for the incident of the other day.”</p><p>He still hopes that Shen Jiu will reject it by associating with Liu Qingge, however, he lets out an appreciative sound and contemplates it with interest.</p><p>“It’s… unexpectedly nice,” he mutters.</p><p>Shen Yuan sighs even though inside he cries. Exhausted, he walks to his room to sit on the bed and face the truth that he has been avoiding all that time.</p><p>
<em> System, can we skip the Abyss Arc? </em>
</p><p>The System’s answer fills him with panic and anguish, with despair as he realizes that it is almost impossible to fight against destiny and perhaps all his efforts have been in vain.</p>

<p>Stress is a monster woven with dark feelings and Shen Jiu had let it grow.</p><p>The monster is immense and that night it traps Shen Jiu in a heavy sleep, similar to sinking into the black waters of an abyss. The nightmare begins as always: with the fire that devours the Qiu mansion. But from the ashes emerges familiar figures that he recognizes as their features were drawn: Yue Qingyuan, Liu Qingge, Mu Qingfang... All the Peak Lords gather around him along with his disciples. Shen Jiu watches as they discover his secret and everyone, absolutely everyone, chooses Shen Yuan.</p><p>The familiar fear of losing everything grows until engulfing him. Shen Jiu wants to speak, but he can’t find his voice. He can only see how Shen Yuan laughs innocently and that makes the disciples happy. Liu Qingge also smiles before giving him another fan and Yue Qingyuan looks less tired and more of the Qi-Ge of the past. Shen Jiu is trapped by cobweb-like shadows and cannot move. But the weight of the darkness is lightened when Shen Yuan turns and looks at him and also smiles at him and reaches out a hand to him and…</p><p>He disappears. Between dust and bamboo leaves.</p><p>And a hole grows in his chest. It’s an old fear that opens like a mouth to devour him whole and Shen Jiu falls as everything disappears. He falls and falls and...</p><p>Shen Jiu awakens with ragged breathing and the echo of the nightmare tangled in his heart. His hand holding the sheets is shaking. Although he got used to bad dreams in the past, so much has happened since the last nightmare that he feels some uncertainty. Shen Jiu lets out a growl as he rubs his eyes.</p><p>He doesn’t remember what he has dreamed of, only fleeting images and emotions. <em> Perhaps I have dreamed again when Qi-Ge abandoned me? </em> he thinks with a frown. What he does remember is that before waking up someone hugged him. It was a brief but comforting hug that made him feel like he isn’t alone.</p><p>
<em> What nonsense. </em>
</p><p>Although the nightmare is over, Shen Jiu has escaped from one prison to end up in the nets of insomnia. Aware that that night he won’t rest (and he’s afraid to try again), he gets out of bed and places a green robe over his inner robes. Shen Jiu moves by inertia, trying to erase his last memories of the dream. He has no purpose, however, he stops when he discovers that there is light in Shen Yuan's room. After letting out a hiss, although he heads towards it with impatient steps, he opens the door carefully. Just in case.</p><p>He is not surprised to find that Shen Yuan is still reading a bestiary without realizing that it’s dark outside the window. Shen Jiu clears his throat and his double startles, closing the book guiltily.</p><p>“What?” He splutters. “Who? What time is it?”</p><p>“Late,” he growls.</p><p>Shen Yuan giggles nervously as he rubs his eyes. <em> What a way to waste your cultivation, voluntarily deciding to not sleep to continue reading something rather than waiting for the next day </em>, Shen Jiu huffs.</p><p>“Sorry, did I wake you up?”</p><p>Shen Jiu decides to not answer, although he hesitates between a lie and a half-truth. In the end, he shrugs and finishes opening the door with a gentle kick.</p><p>“Since you are not sleepy, follow me.”</p><p>Shen Yuan lets out a muffled complaint that means perfectly: <em> Yes, I'm sleepy, it's just that I was reading something very exciting and I couldn't stop, but now I feel my eyes close </em>. Shen Jiu doesn't care. He picks up his guqin and hands it to Shen Yuan, who looks at him first and then at the instrument with wide eyes with curiosity.</p><p>“I've never heard you play,” he explains, sitting in front of the table. “Your calligraphy is pretty decent and you also know how to defend yourself with the sword, but if you want to teach the brats music you need to have the level worthy of the Lord of Qing Jing Peak.”</p><p>“Oh,” he mutters, still surprised.</p><p>Shen Yuan sits in front of him, the guqin on his knees. He is about to start playing when Shen Jiu cuts him off with a gesture.</p><p>“What songs do you know?”</p><p>Shen Yuan nervously lowers his gaze and responds with stutters. Shen Jiu frowns, wary of his doubts. All the melodies that Shen Yuan has mentioned are traditional in Qing Jing Peak, but that is not enough to pass his exam. Shen Jiu orders him to play a fragment of all of them. He plays the guqin reflecting the same doubts with which he has responded.</p><p>“You know the melody, but you hesitate too much and that causes you to lose harmony,” he points at him. Before correcting his mistakes, Shen Jiu needs to know the cause behind them. “I make you nervous?”</p><p>“A little,” he acknowledges with a sigh.</p><p>“Why? We are alone and not surrounded by twenty squeaky brats.”</p><p>Shen Jiu finds that even more stressful.</p><p>“Because they will forgive me for any mistakes...” he murmurs. “But you...”</p><p>Shen Yuan mutes when Shen Jiu raises an eyebrow. No, he's not going to forgive him for any mistakes, but he's not a monster either. Shen Jiu takes a deep breath, although this is one of those times when he doesn't feel anger building in his chest. The nightmare has left him tired and vulnerable.</p><p>“I won’t punish you.” Shen Jiu crosses his arms as he stares at him. “But I'm not going to let you get away either: you will learn how to play the guqin perfectly.”</p><p>“For the classes?”</p><p>Shen Yuan looks confused. Shen Jiu ignores him, although deep down he also doesn’t know why he has made that decision. Perhaps out of pride, perhaps because he needs an excuse to not go back to bed, and music has always accompanied him on sleepless nights.</p><p>“I'm not going to punish you,” he repeats. “If you learn to play correctly, you will be able to teach more. So relax.”</p><p>Shen Jiu is aware that his rough words, almost orders, are not the most suitable for anyone to relax. But he doesn't know how to speak kinder either. Instead of listening to him, Shen Yuan rests his hands on the instrument.</p><p>“Can I tell you something without you getting angry?”</p><p>“I can try.”</p><p>Shen Jiu never makes promises that he cannot keep.</p><p>“I don’t know how to play.”</p><p>“That’s ridiculous,” Shen Jiu frowns. “You haven’t done well, but it has been a better disaster than most of those who are starting.”</p><p>He has deduced from his words and his own suspicions that Shen Yuan had to learn recently to fill his role.</p><p>“I didn’t know how to play, but I received the ability when I occupied your body. Just like fighting or spiritual powers.”</p><p>Yes, Shen Jiu has a good reason to be angry. He hasn’t only tried to steal his position and name, but also all the skills he has acquired after years of suffering. He has literally bled to get so far but someone (perhaps a heavenly official?) would decide to eliminate him and put an imitator in his place, gifting him his talent.</p><p>Oblivious to his furious thoughts, Shen Yuan continues speaking.</p><p>“Although I know how to play the guqin, I don't know the songs. Do you understand me? In my first days, I asked the disciples what their favorite songs were. I memorized the names and then asked them to play them to try to learn them myself.” He lets out a sigh. “With you, I am nervous because you will know how to recognize if the songs I am playing correctly or I have invented them.”</p><p>“So they blessed you with a musical talent,” he splutters, still shaken with envy. “How lucky you are.”</p><p>“I didn't want to be here either, okay?” The two look at each other. Shen Yuan seems nervous, also a bit annoyed. “I didn't want to have to learn to be you or follow a script to make things happen, even if I hate it.”</p><p>Shen Jiu suspects that there is something else hidden in his voice, but Shen Yuan plunges back into the hermetic silence of the early days when they still didn’t trust each other. Shen Jiu gets up and walks towards him, ignoring Shen Yuan's tense posture. He sits down next to him and slides the instrument so that it is between them. That is a gesture that he wouldn’t have made on another occasion, but some words from Shen Yuan have made him shake.</p><p>“Although I hate that you have benefited from my abilities, I recognize that you also have your merit,” he says in a low voice as if is afraid someone else might hear that moment of weakness. “I guess you also have to work hard to be Shen Qingqiu even if it has been in a different way than mine.”</p><p>Shen Yuan is looking at him, still fearful in his eyes, but also intrigued and suspicious.</p><p>“Are you okay?” He finally says. “You look pale. Are you sick? Have you poisoned yourself again?”</p><p>“Shen Yuan!” Shen Jiu hisses. “I also consider that you have acted stupidly. If you don't know how to play, you may have told me to teach you.”</p><p>“You hate to teach!”</p><p>That’s true.</p><p>“You don't go to bed tonight until you learn a song correctly,” he ignores him. “If you're not sleepy and need to kill time with boring bestiaries, don't worry, we can spend the nights perfecting the four arts.”</p><p>Shen Yuan is visibly horrified and Shen Jiu can't take it anymore and ends up laughing.</p><p>“Are you making fun of me? You have a sense of humor!!!!” Shen Yuan is still restless, but he just joins his laugh. It doesn't last long. “Because it's a joke, right?”</p><p>His voice trembles and Shen Jiu is very tempted to say no, but in the end, he sighs and nods.</p><p>“Partially. I appreciate my hours of sleep and you should do the same. If you continue to stay awake, I will confiscate your bestiaries. Or I will send you calligraphy exercises so that you can make better use of your time.”</p><p>“Or fall asleep of boredom,” he grumbles. “Ey! You said the other day that my calligraphy was fine!”</p><p>“Fine it’s not excellent.”</p><p>“Your standards are impossible. You know, right?”</p><p>“If I can do it, you, precisely you, also can.”</p><p>Shen Yuan grumbles as he runs out of arguments Shen Jiu notes with satisfaction that victory. He begins to play some random notes under the watchful eye of Shen Yuan, slightly dazed by sleep.</p><p>They remain for a while in a silence dotted with musical notes. Until Shen Yuan speaks again.</p><p>“Were you serious about teaching me?” He asks uncertainly, playing with the edges of his sleeves.</p><p>“Mn.” Shen Jiu stops playing while appreciating one of those comments that he has made earlier. Shen Yuan is right: he hates teaching, although he is capable of making only one exception. “We could make a schedule.”</p><p>“So you can teach me and balance your Peak Lord duties?”</p><p>“No. On dividing up Shen Qingqiu's tasks between ourselves.”</p><p>It's funny, but this is the first time that he has spoken of Shen Qingqiu as if he were someone else. And it is liberating. To be Shen Qingqiu means to represent every day a figure that he has created from nothing and that must be absolutely perfect. And it’s tiring. Until Shen Yuan appeared, he hadn't realized how frustrated he was living a lie that he had locked himself in.</p><p>“We can divide up the different classes and alternate between your... strange excursions with my theory classes.” Shen Jiu pretends to focus on the guqin strings to ignore Shen Yuan's bright gaze, the wide smile that he is drawing. “We can alternate between mornings and afternoons, so we can both go out every day. We can also work together on Shen Qingqiu Peak Lord's duties.”</p><p>A malevolent smirk escapes him at the thought that everyone else will be shocked by Shen Qingqiu's inhuman efficiency. </p><p>“That’s… Great!” Shen Yuan reacts as he had intuited: with genuine joy and that typical enthusiasm before planning something new. “Should we start the schedule now?”</p><p>“No. I already told you: you don't go to bed until you learn a song.”</p><p>Shen Jiu ignores all his complaints and starts to play one of the simplest melodies.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Shen Jiu is a horrible person who has left him without sleep and also forces him to get up early. Shen Yuan grunts and yawns when the two of them eat their breakfast. He is left with the consolation that Luo Binghe's food is still delicious and is a good reason for getting out of bed. Shen Yuan feels those horrible regrets again when he thinks about Luo Binghe's fate.</p><p>He glances at Shen Jiu. Last night he definitely became a different person from the scum villain. And that makes him feel even more uncomfortable when he remembers his future. Their future. Shen Yuan puts down the chopsticks and takes a deep breath. Shen Jiu made an unexpected decision that ended up breaking the chains between them. However, he still hides many secrets.</p><p>“I need to talk to you about the Alliance Conference.”</p><p>Shen Jiu raises his head. He seems intrigued, though he immediately frowns.</p><p>“Another event that you know and that should happen as you have been told?”</p><p>Shen Yuan is surprised by his sagacity. He nods, still hesitating for the right words to present his dilemma to him. And if he should tell him the truth about Luo Binghe.</p><p>“Let me guess: that brat Luo Binghe will win.”</p><p>“Indeed. He will start without attracting attention, as he will end up protecting a very large group of disciples from other sects. Especially the Huan Hua Palace...”</p><p>“Why doesn’t it surprise me?” Shen Jiu clicks his tongue, <span>annoyed</span>. “That sect is a nest of vermin. If you don't have the level, then don't show up to the Alliance Conference or disturb my disciple.”</p><p>Shen Yuan would have laughed at his reaction if the uneasiness weren't a twisted snake in his stomach.</p><p>“However, Luo Binghe will win in the end.”</p><p>“Should I be surprised?” His words are sour and dismissive.</p><p>“Luo Binghe will face Nu yuan chan, various human-headed spiders, and finally defeat a Moon Python Rhinoceros.”</p><p>Shen Jiu, who had rolled his eyes, regains his composure.</p><p>“What are you talking about? Those monsters are too dangerous for the disciples to be in the Alliance Conference.”</p><p>“And… that’s the problem.”</p>

<p>
<span>Hiding behind his fan, Shen Yuan watches over the disciples. His gaze is fixed on Luo Binghe, who seems to show off sword exercises more than usual. Surely to impress Ning Yingying. On another occasion, Shen Yuan would have laughed at his innocent attempts to attract attention, but that morning he feels bitter discomfort as he remembers that that sword will be shattered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Luo Binghe, come here." Shen Yuan calls him when the disciples finish their exercises.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe reacts immediately. He runs up to him with the same enthusiasm as a pomeranian puppy. Shen Yuan can't help but wonder if that will be the last time he will see his smile. His thoughts are irrational, but he is not only afraid of what he can become but also feels immense sadness. Shen Yuan already suffered reading his story, but this time it's worse now that he knows Luo Binghe is real.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, shizun?” He asks with bright eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you want to be strong?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although Luo Binghe still smiles, his expression becomes more serious and determined.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, shizun! I...” The boy looks into his eyes with the intensity of a shonen protagonist. “I want to be strong so I can protect the one dearest to me, no matter what hardships I will suffer.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan sighs before ruffling Luo Binghe's hair. </span>
<em>
<span>Sorry</span>
</em>
<span>, he thinks when Luo Binghe returns together with the rest of the disciples. </span>
<em>
<span>But nothing will make you stronger than the Abyss</span>
</em>
<span>. He is left with the smallest consolation that this is Luo Binghe's wish.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After talking to Luo Binghe and making a horrible decision that he is afraid he’ll regret, Shen Yuan looks away at the bamboo house. His lungs swell with determination as he decides that he will also tell the truth about Luo Binghe to Shen Jiu. However, the System beeps, loud and annoying. Shen Yuan curses silently as he raises a hand to his head. He may not be able to reveal Luo Binghe's secret aloud, but Shen Jiu is smart. Perhaps there is another way to tell him the truth without him being punished.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu crosses out Ning Yingying's name from the list of candidates for the Alliance Conference. He frowns as he wonders if it will be suspicious to also remove his Head Disciple. And everyone else except Luo Binghe. Although that decision would only protect his own, all the other brats remain in mortal danger. Shen Yuan doesn’t know the exact numbers or even which peaks will be hit the hardest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In a fit of rage, Shen Jiu smashes the list with his qi. He hates feeling cornered. Although he is supposed to be Cang Qiong Sect's strategy and also has unique information about the future, he is caught in doubts. Shen Yuan hasn’t confirmed it, but Shen Jiu suspects that the demons' involvement is part of the sabotage. Perhaps related to the last demon invasion. If he sends a few brats, it will be a way of shouting that he knows what is going to happen. That will make him a traitor and Shang Qinghua already suspects him. Shen Jiu doesn't want to be wrongly accused, but the only way to avoid it is to do nothing and have the brats die. That would be playing the demon’s game, which makes him feel even more furious.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The third option is to avoid the Alliance Conference.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But then Shen Yuan will die.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu clenches his fists until he digs his nails. For some inexplicable reason, the prospect of Shen Yuan dying fills him with an icy feeling. After all, he is still a despicable person, cruel and selfish, capable of allowing a massacre because he doesn’t want to feel alone again. His gaze looks for the door to the secondary room. Shen Yuan's room. There must be something wrong with him to have started to care about someone dangerous, with too many secrets, and who started as his prisoner. His mistrust insists that everything can be part of a devious trap. Shen Yuan's concern may be false, perhaps he is trying to deceive him to gain freedom and, one day, impersonate him permanently. But Shen Jiu begins to get tired of so many doubts and something inside him treasures those last weeks.</span>
</p><p><span>The door opens. Shen Yuan enters</span> <span>with the same sullen spirit with which he told him the truth about the Alliance Conference. Shen Jiu wants to believe that he is not pretending. Shen Yuan is too soft, he loves those brats and it is hard for him to sleep thinking that they might die.</span></p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu wants to promise him that he will fix it. And that is stupid, irrational, and dangerous. Shen Jiu hates those kinds of promises, but he feels the urge on the tip of his tongue. What matters is not the words, but the magic they hide, capable of making a special person smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don't worry so much and assume it.” He growls instead. “If you don't want to die, accept that others will suffer.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That is his roundabout way of acknowledging that he won't allow Shen Yuan to die.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan lets out a groan. He begins to wander around the room with increasingly restless and impatient steps. At this rate, Shen Jiu will also become dizzy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There's something I haven't told you about Luo Binghe. I can't tell you directly either,” he starts, gesturing very quickly with the fan. “So, please listen to me carefully: the last monster that Luo Binghe will defeat will be the Moon Python Rhinoceros. Then his sword will break.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan pauses, biting his lip as he raises a hand to his head. As if it’s hurting him. Shen Jiu doesn't think about what he's doing when he rises from the table to walk toward him with impatient strides, instigated by stress and that visceral, suffocating fear that he shouldn't feel.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m fine...” he splutters with his eyes closed when Shen Jiu grabs his wrist to convey qi to him. “As I was saying...”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don't care about the damn Luo Binghe,” he hisses. “What’s wrong with you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan takes a deep breath. Although he manages to open his eyes, he is still pale.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nothing. It’s just a headache.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you can't say it, don't say it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu hates feeling that irrational panic, which reminds him of when he was a miserable child on the street and every night he fell asleep fearing that Qi-Ge would disappear when he opened his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s fine. I'm not going to tell you anything that I can't tell you, but it's important to the story that you know some details.” Shen Yuan growls through his teeth. And although they are alone, he acts like he is talking to someone else. Shen Jiu notices a chill down the back of his neck, wondering not for the first time if they are being watched by someone invisible or superhuman. A god perhaps. “A rift will open to the Endless Abyss.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“WHAT?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Luo Binghe must fall in the Abyss.” It seems that the threat has freed Shen Yuan, as he speaks more confidently. “But he will survive.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu huffs, turning away from Shen Yuan now that he knows he's okay. However, he grabs his arm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He will survive in the Abyss, the place where all mortals perish and only the most powerful creatures...” he coughs, “...demons...” he coughs again. ”...survive, do you understand what that means?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu frowns in disgust. He already knew that the fate of that brat was special, but that's too much. At another time, it would have been inconceivable to him, but after so long Shen Jiu discovers that he trusts Shen Yuan's prophecies. The envy that poisons his heart grows as he accepts that Luo Binghe will be the first human to survive the Endless Abyss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He clicks his tongue as he turns his back on him to hide his ridiculous feelings.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It means that you don't have to worry about that brat.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He will suffer hell for five years!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That's nothing,” he mutters as he remembers his own hell. “Five years, huh? And for sure he will return stronger and more powerful.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes!” Shen Yuan yells, almost exclaims, with an odd expression. Not quite excited, rather stressed. “In the Abyss, Luo Binghe will grow to his full potential. He will face a lot of huge, poisonous, and deadly monsters. Although he will defeat them all, he will suffer during all those fights. He... He will return in a rage. It could be said that our white lotus dies in the abyss.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What white lotus?” He rolls his eyes. “</span>
<em>
<span>We </span>
</em>
<span>don’t have any white lotus.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu recognizes how stupid it is to envy a boy whose destiny is to suffer an unimaginable hell for five years, but he can't help but think that Luo Binghe is lucky. According to Shen Yuan, that will make him stronger, while Shen Jiu's hell broke his future and filled him with fear, with invisible wounds that still bleed. Many years have passed, but his past still marks his character, his relationship with everyone else, his coldness in reacting to his disciple’s misfortune.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“In the Abyss, he will find a sword...”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh!” Shen Jiu can no longer control himself and releases all his poisonous sarcasm. “Lucky him! His spirit sword breaks, but he will eventually find one at the bottom of the Endless Abyss. Let me guess, will it also be a special sword?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes! But it won’t be a spiritual sword. You will never find a spirit sword in the Abyss. But it will be a very powerful sword, famous for its non-spiritual energy. You know, that other energy that is so abundant in a demonic place...”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Got it, it's a demon sword.” He frowns. “Don't tell me that he will master it too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan nods, perhaps a little uneasy at his icy gaze. At that moment he is no longer surprised that Luo Binghe, a talented cook and tenacious survivor, can achieve the impossible of mastering a demonic sword.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But that will have a cost, right?” He desperately needs to hear something negative about Luo Binghe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan nods again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He will tend to suffer from qi deviations. But he will discover that he can reverse the effects of the sword with dual cultivation.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu decides to ignore the thought that Shen Yuan wanted to teach dual cultivation for Luo Binghe's sake. He raises the fan to the tip of his lips while he values that information. It is an unorthodox method, but some human cultivators compensated the demonic energy of swords, talismans, and other artifacts with such strategies.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But if it's a sword as powerful as you say, he'll need..." He rubs his eyes as he sighs. "How many?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A lot of. I lost count, but I think he will marry three hundred women.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu looks at him with wide eyes. Every piece of information he discovers is more ridiculous than the last.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you kidding me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No. And many of his marriages will be very important. He will marry the Little Palace Mistress from Huan Hua Palace, so...”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He will become the lord of the Huan Hua Palace,” he completes between grunts. “Why are you worried about him? That brat will have it all in life after a little trip through hell.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m worried about us!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu ignores him. He is still assimilating that Luo Binghe, a hideously talented but normal person like the rest, survives the Endless Abyss, masters a demon sword, and becomes the lord of the Huan Hua Palace. Reluctantly, he begins to accept it. But the three hundred women seems a scandal to him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Haven't you been kidding me? Where will he find so many female cultivators?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not all of them will be cultivators.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Normal women?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not all of them...” Shen Yuan is staring into his eyes very intently as if he needs him to solve a riddle that he hasn’t said. “Not all will be human.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu almost broke the fan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“DEMONS TOO?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan nods, looking away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“To return he will have to go through the Demon Realm. He won’t do it peacefully.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It is as if all the pieces of an enigma have begun to fit together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks to Luo Binghe, will the fights between humans and demons end?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It could be said that he will unite both realms.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu thinks he understands what Shen Yuan was referring to when he told him when they met that Luo Binghe's fate was so special. The true story of that boy will begin with the Alliance Conference when he defeats those legendary monsters. Then he will fall to the Endless Abyss where he will survive, find a demonic sword, and be able to master it. So, perhaps enraged against the demons that ruined his life in the Alliance Conference, he will destroy the Demon Realm and become a human hero.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The force that has brought Shen Yuan must be a Heavenly Officer. After destroying demons, becoming the lord of the Huan Hua Palace, and marrying an endless harem, it stands to reason for Luo Binghe to ascend to the Heavens.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Comparisons are useless, yet Shen Jiu feels miserable comparing his life to his. Is his destiny ultimately limited to being the chosen child's shizun? Well, it's better than being a slave. Although reluctantly and enviously, Shen Jiu can aspire to gain power alongside Luo Binghe. The brat is very innocent and seems to always listen to him with enthusiasm. Also, he cooks very well and he wants to continue enjoying his food.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There are still a few months until the Alliance Conference,” he says. “Let's get that little beast ready. And let's think of a way to prevent the rest of the useless from dying.”</span>

<p>
<span>Shen Jiu is walking through Qing Jing Peak carrying a pile of scrolls when he sees several disciples practicing with the sword. Once again, Luo Binghe stands out the most. Shen Jiu squints his eyes, torn between envy and his new interest in benefiting from the brat's future fame. After letting out a sigh, Shen Jiu approaches the disciples.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ming Fan!” He calls out to him. “Today you will accompany me to the Peak Lords' meeting.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His Head Disciple bows his head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, shizun!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Luo Binghe!” His gaze is now fixed on the other boy. “Your movements are pretentious. Trying to master techniques above your level is dangerous and counterproductive. You don't want to break your sword before the Alliance Conference, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His concern, camouflaged with antipathy, is genuine. Without a sword, he would be forced to remove Luo Binghe from the list. And even if he could go with a training sword, Luo Binghe won't be able to defeat those monsters. His fate will be truncated and many will die.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry, shizun! This disciple wants to make shizun proud at the Alliance Conference.” Although the boy bows like Ming Fan, his admiration is different. He is just as loyal, but there is a spark of rebellion and determination in his eyes. “I promise that I will take care of Zheng Yang and that it will never break.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh, be careful with your promises, child. </span>
</em>
<span>Shen Jiu almost smirks as he remembers that according to Shen Yuan's prophecy, Luo Binghe's sword will shatter. He gestures for Ming Fan to follow him, but before leaving, Shen Jiu takes one last look at Luo Binghe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you dare to bet? If your sword breaks, you will cook forever for me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I accept.” Luo Binghe sounded defiant. “What if shizun loses?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I never lose.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Not while the future backs me up</span>
</em>
<span>, he thinks as he walks away accompanied by Ming Fan, completely oblivious to Luo Binghe's intense gaze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The meeting is going to be held at Qiong Ding Peak. Between gambling (tricking) with Luo Binghe, getting distracted by picking up the scrolls, and wasting time with Shen Yuan (who had insisted on teaching him a ridiculous game for making decisions called: rock, paper, or scissors), Shen Jiu arrives the last. He hates being late. And even if it’s not true, Shen Jiu feels that everyone is looking at him, that they will whisper about the reasons for his delay. Perhaps they will call him lazy or careless again. He walks with his head straight and followed by Ming Fan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu sits down at his place and the meeting begins. Unsurprisingly, the main theme is the Alliance Conference. There are many topics to discuss: the volunteers who will help the Huan Hua Palace, the budget, the lists that each peak has drawn up... Shen Jiu listens without intervening, only making occasional faces that he hides behind his fan. He would rather interrupt his banalities but their plan calls for subtlety.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There is something that he hasn’t told Shen Yuan. Perhaps because he doesn’t want to worry him: the Shang Qinghua matter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The previous step in the plan is to dispose of him discreetly. Shang Qinghua mustn’t find out who will come up with the idea that will change everything so he will never suspect that Shen Qingqiu has inside information because he has conspired with demons.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When the meeting seems to be over, Shen Jiu slaps his table with the fan. He needs a single blow, dry and forceful, to silence the voices that had begun to spread and for no one to get up despite their intentions. Although the silence has returned, a resigned sigh is heard. Shen Qingqiu's interventions have never been anyone's favorite. Perhaps Yue Qingyuan’s, the only one who clears his throat before smiling at him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Does shidi have anything to add?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I want to exchange a few words with the Peak Lords who are planning to bring disciples to the Alliance Conference.” He pauses theatrically before staring at Shang Qinghua. “I have brought my Head Disciple to take care of the corresponding paperwork, but if the Lord of An Ding Peak is not very busy, he can also stay...”</span>
</p><p>
<span>An Ding Peak is one of the peaks that doesn’t bring disciples to the Alliance Conference, as they work on the previous preparations. Of course, mentioning extra and expendable work while he is already saturated makes Shang Qinghua turn pale and get up first.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry, Shen-shixiong, my disciples and I are very busy...”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The other Peak Lords also say goodbye without losing that opportunity to flee. In the end, only the representatives of Qing Jing Peak, Qiong Ding Peak, Bai Zhan Peak, Xian Shu Peak, Wan Jian Peak, and Ku Xing Peak remain. Mu Qingfang hesitates, as his disciples attend without participating as they will heal the wounded. With a nod, Shen Jiu gestures for him to stay.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have been thinking and making a list is the worst method to decide which disciples will participate in the Alliance Conference,” he starts, trying immensely to keep his voice from being unpleasant. Shen Yuan has been teaching him. “I want to propose a different method: an exam divided into different parts. Each of them will be held on one of our peaks. The objective of the test is that the disciples won’t be chosen by their teacher, but by consensus among all of us.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although Shen Jiu tries to keep calm as he unfolds the scrolls, his pulse has quickened. His horrible fame works against him, although the gazes of his martial brothers are more curious than when he proposed the dual cultivation classes. And perhaps the success of those classes has cemented that on this occasion they seem to contemplate his possibility instead of rejecting it. Shen Jiu ignores Yue Qingyuan, as he knows that he will always support him, and looks at the others.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have drawn up a draft of how the exam could be, although I intend that we plan it together.” That part is Shen Yuan’s idea, who thinks the other Peak Lords will be more assertive if they can actively collaborate. “I propose that each peak organizes a test that will assess different abilities of the disciples. As it is a simulation of the Alliance Conference, they will be able to participate individually or in groups. Ideally, the tests would be unpredictable and could be solved with different answers, just like they will do at the Alliance Conference.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The pressure on Shen Jiu's chest is somewhat eased when he discovers that the others seem to be pondering it and their expressions are more curious than skeptical. Liu Qingge crosses his arms and stares at him, causing Shen Jiu to lose his composure a bit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He and Liu Qingge always discussed all proposals in the meetings, even those that didn’t affect them. Has he changed that much or will he remain the same?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I also think that only the strongest disciples should go,“ he says and Shen Jiu lets out a sigh of relief. “What did you think about those tests?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Evaluate according to our areas of knowledge: I will be in charge of presenting hypothetical situations with monsters and they must know how to face all threats. I had also thought that Liu-shidi could evaluate their fighting skills, Wei-shidi the state of their swords...” He lists his ideas and also listens to what they want to add. Truth be told, Shen Jiu is indifferent to what they do in the other peaks. The real test will take place at Qing Jing Peak. “Mu-shidi's disciples will stand by, but I also consider that he must take a test on basic notions of first aid.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu fans himself satisfactorily while Ming Fan writes and the other Pear Lords discuss the plan. They have accepted it... unexpectedly well. Everyone has many ideas: Liu Qingge seems eager at the idea of beating other disciples, Mu Qingfang is also excited to teach classes…</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just out of curiosity, Shen-shixiong,” Qi Qingqi intervenes, still looking at him with suspicion, but also interest. “Why are you so interested in the education of the entire sect?”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>To save their pathetic lives, </span>
</em>
<span>he thinks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is it not obvious? I plan to win the Alliance Conference,” he responds arrogantly. “One of my disciples will win, but yours must also beat the ones from Huan Hua Palace.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Of course, that unleashes an earthquake of opposing opinions and challenges. There is no longer suspicion in Qi Qingqi's eyes when she stands up triumphantly and exclaims that Liu Mingyan is also aiming to win. Liu Qingge seems undecided between supporting his sister or one of his disciples.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The meeting has ended in chaos, but Shen Jiu is very satisfied when he finally tells Ming Fan that he can leave. He hasn't even needed to resort to his not-so-secret trick: appeal to Yue Qingyuan. That victory is entirely his and Shen Yuan's.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He is walking towards the Rainbow Bridge with slow steps, enjoying the lovely day when Liu Qingge catches up with him. Shen Jiu lets out a weary sigh. But Liu Qingge for once hasn't complained and even supported him, so he wipes his grimace away and gulps his bitter words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Does Liu-shidi want to talk about something?” He probes him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You're not thinking of telling the disciples which beasts will appear at the Alliance Conference, are you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu forgets all his good intentions and lets out a furious hiss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why do you always think the worst of me?” Although Liu Qingge is right: he plans to tell them about all the monsters... who shouldn’t be but will be. “I will win without cheating.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge crosses his arms, unconvinced. Still annoyed, Shen Qingqiu walks faster to outrun him. However, Liu Qingge pursues him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu stops.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu turns around very slowly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu looks into his eyes with stupefaction.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Have you apologized or have I heard wrong?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge meets his gaze defiantly, though his posture is somewhat tense.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have offended you by assuming something wrong, so I apologize.” His words come out in fits and start, with the clumsiness of someone who has never made a mistake before and doesn’t know how to apologize.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Suddenly, Shen Jiu realizes that Liu Qingge probably had suspected him since the meeting but he wanted to confirm it when they were alone. Perhaps to not influence the other Peak Lords or avoid further unfair accusations as has happened in the past. That little detail makes him feel strange and Shen Jiu turns his back on him so that his expression doesn’t betray him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Apologies accepted,” he murmurs in a voice that is softer than furious.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead of leaving, Liu Qingge walks up to his side.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What monsters? I hope they are dangerous.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Human-headed spiders...”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Once I ended up with a nest of those. They are unpleasant, but easy to defeat.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“...Moon Python Rhinoceros...”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I like this. I've never found one, but one day I want to defeat it. Several of them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu hides a laugh behind his fan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don't be pretentious, shidi. That monster is dangerous even to the dreaded War God.” He shakes his head to erase the smile that was escaping him. “Nu yuan chan...”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh! I have defeated two of those.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Really? I've only read about it, what are they like?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They speak without Shen Jiu noticing that they are crossing the Rainbow Bridge together. Their conversation about monsters turns into one about their respective experiences and memories of their night hunts. Although he always considered such trips a nightmare, suddenly not all anecdotes are bad. Shen Jiu forgets to hide his cruel laughter by mentioning all the times that Liu Qingge made a mistake facing the wrong monster. And Liu Qingge takes revenge by mentioning his accidents.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Shen Jiu realizes it, they have reached the bamboo house. Shen Yuan's secret presence brings him back to reality. Shen Jiu clears his throat and tries to regain his cold expression.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“See you, shidi.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“See you, Shen Qingqiu.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge nods. His response is firm, more like a promise than empty, polite words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu enters the house wondering what has happened to him to end up spending so much time with one of the people he least tolerates. And quite a nice time. However, he immediately forgets it when he hears Shen Yuan's voice. Shen Jiu walks up to his room, where Shen Yuan was writing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How has it been?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine.” He proceeds to give him an accurate summary of the meeting. “In the next few days, we will have to organize the exam. This brings us to two problems: first, others mustn’t discover ours. It's too much of a coincidence that we are going to train all the disciples how to defeat unexpected monsters. Second, we have to ensure that Luo Binghe wins the other test.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t worry! He will!” As always, Shen Yuan is delusionally optimistic when it’s related to that brat. “I have good news too! I think I have an idea to facilitate Luo Binghe's journey through the Abyss. And give him a reason to come down himself...”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>It all starts one morning at Qiong Ding Peak with almost all the Peak Lords discussing the exam. Shen Yuan is very excited which is why a smile escapes him when Liu Qingge stands next to him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Liu-shidi?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you remember you told me that your disciple's food was the best?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hmmm...” No, Shen Yuan doesn't remember, although that's something he could have easily said, so he nods.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is your invitation still standing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hmmm… yes?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge also smiles. He has a very pretty smile that doesn’t fit with the terrible War God.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“See you tomorrow.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His perfect day is broken when Shen Yuan informs Shen Jiu.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?” He yells. Not furious, but pale and a little scared. “I've never promised anything! He has invited himself!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn't know that!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If I had invited the damn Liu Qingge home I would have told you!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu lets out a snort before reaching for his fan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You have accepted, you will deal with him.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And this is how Shen Yuan finds himself that day sitting in the bamboo house, the scum villain hiding in his room enjoying some tanghulus that he has stolen, a secondary that should be dead sitting in front of him, and the main character bringing a tray saturated with delicious food.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sometimes Shen Yuan believes he is living in fanfic and not in the original work.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It smells good," Liu Qingge concedes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks, Liu-shishu.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe's smile is not like always. Less sincere, a bit forced. Shen Yuan wants to hit him on the head with the fan. </span>
<em>
<span>It's your future brother-in-law! Your first wife's brother! Be nice, Binghe!</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe has prepared a feast worthy of the culinary talent of the protagonist. Shen Yuan smiles as he thinks about what Shen Jiu is missing out of stubbornness. After congratulating Luo Binghe, the boy reluctantly leaves and Shen Yuan can enjoy delicacies that melt in his mouth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a few minutes, he is enjoying it all and forgets that he is not alone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you liking it, shidi?” He smiles in a belated apology for forgetting about his guest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge is also silent, so he assumes that he is loving it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It's good, maybe a little spicy for my taste.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Spicy?” Shen Yuan frowns. “How strange, mine is tasty. Let me try...”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan is unaware that Liu Qingge blushes slightly as he extends the chopsticks to his plate. Later, he is the one who blushes intensely when he takes a bite that burns, that itches, that leaves his throat dry, and makes him cry.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>A LITTLE SPICY? </span>
</em>
<span>He thinks while he chokes. Liu Qingge exclaims his name and gets up to sit next to him as he continues to cough. </span>
<em>
<span>THIS IS INHUMAN, WHAT KIND OF RESISTANCE DO YOU HAVE SHIDI????</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The spicy taste takes a long time to wear off even though Shen Yuan won't stop drinking. With teary eyes, he looks at the smudged figure of Liu Qingge, who is handing him another cup.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks, shidi...” He splutters. “I’m fine. It's just that I can't stand the spice.” He swallows hard before trying to regain his composure. “Do you want some from my plate? Luo Binghe must have made a mistake with the spices.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge sits up very tense, red as if the spicy taste is slowing him down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No...” He blinks, staring at something behind Shen Yuan. “Was that door open before?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan stiffens. He remembers very well closing that door so as not to disturb Shen Jiu or that Shen Jiu is discovered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My cat,” he babbles before going to close it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge is already sitting in his seat again when Shen Yuan returns to the table.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn't know you had a cat.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hahaha… yes… Should I ask Luo Binghe to bring the desserts?”</span>

<p>
<span>Only one Shen Qingqiu can go to the Alliance Conference.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please!” Shen Yuan insists even though Shen Jiu has already refused more than a hundred times. “I prefer to supervise it myself. If it goes wrong...”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You have confirmed to me that your life will be safe as long as Luo Binghe reaches the Endless Abyss no matter how.” Shen Jiu interrupts him, using the fan to aim at him. “Don’t worry. In case our plan fails, I'll push him myself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That is what I want to avoid!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu clicks his tongue, belittling Shen Yuan's drama. The brat will be fine. However, the one who worries him is Shen Yuan. Shen Jiu still remembers that the other day he almost revealed their secret when he heard that Shen Yuan was choking. That is a shameful secret that he has tried to hide. At that moment he feels that same illogical panic. Let Shen Yuan be alone in an intensely dangerous place plagued with horrible monsters? No way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Of course, that is not the excuse he gives.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The Alliance Conference will be dangerous and I still don't trust you enough to lend you Xiu Ya. My answer is no.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan bows his head resigned. Perhaps he will continue to insist since he is as stubborn as Shen Jiu. But he is the one with the power to decide who will go and he will never change his mind, even if Shen Yuan keeps insisting until the last day. Still, Shen Jiu feels an unexpected urge to promise him that he will take care of it. </span>
<em>
<span>Nonsense, </span>
</em>
<span>he thinks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m going outside for a walk,” he announces, turning his back on him to head for the door. “Later we will talk about the Alliance Conference.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu needs to get away from the bamboo house, Luo Binghe’s dilemma, and Qing Jing Peak, so he leaves the sect to descend to the city at the foot of the mountain. As he walks the streets, Shen Jiu remembers that he hasn’t visited the Warm Red Pavilion in a long time. At first, because he wanted to avoid annoying comments (and it would upset him if Shen Yuan also judged him like the rest). Later, because his nightmares are over. Since that last strange dream, he hasn't had a bad night again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s an objective fact that Shen Yuan almost killed him and, somehow, has destroyed his life. However, he has also brought him tranquility that wasn’t there before. His days are more chaotic now, but Shen Jiu has remembered what fun is, he also has another person to talk to... someone he almost trusts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu hasn't felt like this for years. That reminds him of his happiest and most miserable time when he was a filthy kid who had his Qi-Ge. Now he is rich and powerful, but he is alone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Or perhaps not.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His erratic steps lead him to a market. For once, Shen Jiu doesn't care that there are so many people. This allows him to hide in the crowd and feel that for once no one is watching him. Shen Jiu wanders among the stands looking for nothing in particular. He kills time with silly excuses that help him forget all his doubts and worries.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu stops in front of a stand with jade and silver crowns. His fingers caress an especially elegant one, with light green ribbons. Months ago, he gave Shen Yuan his old clothes and accessories that he no longer liked. At that moment, he understands that Shen Yuan has nothing that belongs to him, only the fan that Liu Qingge gave him and he is always using.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Perhaps Shen Jiu could gift him something that would be entirely for Shen Yuan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shen Qingqiu?” Asks a familiar voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu snorts before hiding behind his fan. Of all the people in the world, he has had to be discovered by Liu Qingge. His shidi's gaze lingers on his fan and to his shame, Shen Jiu discovers that he has chosen the one he gave him. Sadly, the brute Liu Qingge has an inexplicable talent for choosing beautiful things.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The same,” he growls, trying to ignore him. “What are you doing here?“</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Buying a gift for my sister. And you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Buying a… thing for myself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu has always preferred to lie, allowing others to believe that he is selfish, conceited, or cruel. Ignoring Liu Qingge, Shen Qingqiu indicates to the saleswoman that he wants that crown.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After putting the package in his qiankun pouch, Shen Jiu tries to walk away, but there are so many people that he has no choice but to go in the same direction as Liu Qingge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you have plans?” Liu Qingge asks, walking beside him.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Talk to my double about how to save your brats, train my hateful disciple destined to be a hero... </span>
</em>
<span>Shen Jiu shrugs. Maybe nothing would happen if he takes the day off for once.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>In another life, in another world, Shen Yuan claimed in a blog that anyone could have written PIDW better than Airplane. Ironically, he is trapped in a complicated and almost impossible-to-resolve situation. And his only plan is to rewrite a scene from PIDW.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan has asked the System the conditions to surpass that arc. The only essential condition is that Luo Binghe should end up in the Abyss to continue the plot. What if the reasons were less traumatic than being pushed by his shizun? That could change everything! Shen Yuan is convinced that his current sweet White Lotus doesn’t hate Shen Qingqiu. Even Shen Jiu is surrendering to the protagonist's charms!</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now Shen Yuan has the uncomfortable pressure to write a logical script that maintains the plot without making Shen Qingqiu the villain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s the night when Shen Jiu returns.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan is working on his script but gets up at the sound of the door closing. He leaves his room, but first picks up the white cat that now lives with them. (Yes, they now have a cat although Shen Jiu still pretends it doesn't exist). He intends to speak seriously with Shen Jiu about the representation of that scene, however, he surprises him by handing him a package. Shen Yuan releases the cat to open it. Inside there is a crown of jade and silver, with ribbons the same green as the first bamboo shoots.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It's pretty, but he doesn't understand why he gave it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was leisurely strolling in the market when Liu Qingge started to annoy me, so I had to buy something to distract him. I don’t like it. For you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan narrows his eyes. Shen Jiu spoke without looking at him. Also, whenever he is upset, the first thing he does when he arrives at the bamboo house is to complain, not to wait for him to ask. Although Shen Yuan suspects that he is hiding something else, in the end, he doesn’t give it more importance. He has more urgent things to worry about than a crown.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In the last few weeks, they have been actively preparing for the exams with the rest of Peak Lords. They have helped make the disciple screening and secretly trained everyone on the beasts that Shen Yuan remembers appeared in the book. Shen Jiu has even given Luo Binghe private sword lessons, worried that his technique was too arrogant (Shen Yuan found it too cute), but they have been putting off the key part of his plan for lack of time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now that Shen Yuan has the clearest ideas, he doesn’t intend to run away anymore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We need to talk about the Endless Abyss,” he announces, very serious. Shen Yuan would have preferred to go himself, but he has already accepted that he will never get Shen Jiu to change his mind. “Do you remember all the times you have made me rehearse to be the Shen Qingqiu that you have decided? Well, now it will be the other way around. Okay, you will go to the Alliance Conference, but you will do what I tell you.” Shen Yuan pulls the script from his sleeve. “I have written what should happen. And you won't go until you know your role by heart, understood?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>In the end, Shen Qingqiu is just a character from a book. And now they have the power to write what </span>
<em>
<span>Shen Qingqiu</span>
</em>
<span> will do. One will be the actor and the other the writer. And together they will change the end of this book.</span>

<p>
<span>Shen Jiu will never acknowledge that he is as nervous as Shen Yuan. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Of course, it’s Shen Yuan’s fault. Since he has been retouching the script for the last few days, chasing him to make sure he knows his role by heart, adding tools to the qiankun pouch that will be given to Luo Binghe... Inevitably, Shen Jiu has caught his stress.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I've got you several books from the library. Some bestiaries, but also history books that I think you will like. In case you get bored, you can practice your calligraphy. I will read your exercises when I return. I have also sent Luo Binghe to prepare food for you these days. I have protected it with some talismans so that it doesn’t rot. Qing Jing Peak won’t be totally deserted, so be careful when you leave the house. You can of course go outside a bit, although I would prefer you to stay inside to avoid misunderstandings. Understood?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yeah, Shen Jiu is a clear example of a calm person and Shen Yuan is the only one nervous of the two. He should learn from him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Despite his reassuring words, Shen Yuan wrung his hands. He tries to smile but fails and ends up sighing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I'm still worried about Binghe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu wants to growl that this is ridiculous, that Luo Binghe is the only one whose future is guaranteed and Shen Yuan should worry about himself. But saying it out loud would perhaps be acknowledging that he is worried about Shen Yuan. So Shen Jiu crosses his arms with a sneer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Obviously, his advice is useless. Shen Jiu huffs before pulling the qiankun pouch out of his sleeve to give to Shen Yuan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Go. Say goodbye to the brat.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And finally, Shen Jiu makes a huge and bright smile appear on Shen Yuan's face. After thanking him, Shen Yuan leaves the bamboo house with the qiankun pouch in hand. They have prepared a qiankun pouch for each disciple, but Luo Binghe's is special. His has medicinal herbs, spare robes, a knife, supplies…</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu assumes that Shen Yuan will want to say goodbye to all the disciples, so he waits patiently, checking the house one last time to make sure Shen Yuan is not missing anything. His gaze rests at the hideous white cat that Shen Yuan has adopted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Watch him or I'll cook you,” Shen Jiu warns the animal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Obviously, the cat doesn’t respond.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A few hours later, Shen Jiu rides a horse while leading a bunch of restless disciples out of Cang Qiong Mountain Sect. Despite his intentions, chaos is guaranteed and the disciples from the different peaks have mixed. That is their fault because with so many activities young people have made friends in other peaks. Even so, Shen Jiu frowns, annoyed at the noise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Another horse approaches him and soon Liu Qingge rides alongside him. Shen Jiu glances at him, wondering if he's too early to play a little prank on Liu Qingge. Proud as he is, he would bet without hesitation about who disciple will win the Alliance Conference. Shen Jiu squints maliciously as he thinks about what they could bet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>While Shen Jiu thinks evil, Liu Qingge hands him a sachet of pastries. They look homemade and Shen Jiu eagerly accepts some sweets that have been so graciously offered to him. If he were someone else, perhaps he would suspect that they are poisoned, but he can trust Liu Qingge's righteousness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And this surprise, shidi?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are they good?” He asks instead of answering.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A few meters ahead, Luo Binghe has turned and glanced at the two immortals with narrowed eyes as Ming Fan, Ning Yingying, and Liu Mingyan gossip with each other.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hmm… Not bad.” Shen Jiu hesitates before pulling out from his sleeve another sachet almost identical to Liu Qingge's that Luo Binghe had given him that morning. Time to lay a trap for his shidi! “You should try the ones my disciple has made. They are better.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge's expression darkens, a slight annoying blush staining his cheeks, as he purses his lips. In front of them, Luo Binghe smiles and points at them as he talks to his friends.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know? I have high hopes for my disciple. I’m sure that he will win the Alliance Conference...”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The next ones will be better,” Liu Qingge assures before spurring his horse forward.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Oh, no. Liu Qingge is not allowed to leave him with the word in his mouth. Annoyed, Shen Jiu also accelerates, willing to take revenge for all past and present offenses. The two immortals pass in front of the four disciples, who follow their teachers with little dissimulation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shidi!” Shen Jiu calls him. “Do you know what my disciple is even better at than cooking? At hunting monsters.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Really?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge has frowned and stares at the brat who has puffed out his chest and smirks a few meters behind them. Shen Jiu, completely oblivious to the duel of gazes between his disciple and his shidi, continues speaking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes. He is my most diligent and talented disciple. Do you remember how he defeated that demon?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>When he is finally going to throw the bait at him, Liu Qingge clenches his fists and lifts his head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m a better hunter than he is.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Evidently?” Shen Jiu mutters in confusion, erasing Luo Binghe's smirk. “But you won’t participate in the Alliance Conference, he will.“</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe smiles again, albeit with even more determination than before. The fire of winning and making shizun proud, the fire of one day being a better warrior than Liu Qingge. Shen Jiu oblivious still doesn't look back and can’t catch all those nuances in Luo Binghe's gaze. He is keener to understand Liu Qingge's attitude and why he seems about to announce that he will also participate. Perhaps his approach has been wrong. Shen Jiu sighs before patting him on the forearm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shidi, don’t be upset. You already had your glorious time when you were a disciple.” He smiles, leaning toward him as far as his horses allow. “Do you want to do something fun? Let's bet. If Luo Binghe loses, I will train with you as much as you want.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His plan is perfect. Liu Qingge will be unable to refuse that bait. However, Liu Qingge turns around and their faces are suddenly too close.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine,” he says with determination and a hoarse voice. “If I win, we will go on a night hunt together, with no one else.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu blinks in surprise. But since Luo Binghe will win, he doesn't mind that abrupt change. Right now, he would be able to accept anything impossible. Shen Jiu draws a mischievous smirk on his lips before nodding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But what will happen if Liu-shidi loses? Mn?” He teases him. He wishes he can hit his chest with his fan, but it's not a good idea when he's riding. “If shidi wants me to go monster hunting with him, then you will have to stay with me learning manners.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>An intense blush runs down Liu Qingge's cheeks. Shen Qingqiu savors that unusual image. And knowing that he will win, he decides to raise the bet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What about a month?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge holds his gaze. And after a hesitant moment, he nods bravely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>No more abruptly slammed doors! No more dead monsters staining my peak! </span>
</em>
<span>Shen Jiu celebrates. He can finally get revenge for all those times Liu Qingge has ruined his clothes by dragging him into an unwanted spar. But Liu Qingge has been behaving in recent months, so he won’t be very cruel.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu is still savoring his victory as Liu Qingge raises his head and smiles at him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know where we will go.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aren't you overconfident, shidi?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You have never beaten me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My disciple will.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your disciple has to win everyone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And with a jerk of the reins, Liu Qingge accelerates and drives away. Shen Qingqiu frowns as he feels a bit of insecurity in his stomach, but he trusts Shen Yuan. Shen Jiu shook his head, correcting himself: he trusts Shen Yuan's words. Luo Binghe will win.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At that moment, four disciples on horseback approach him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shi-shizun?” Luo Binghe splutters, his hands twisting the reins and his cheeks colored. That his friends are laughing doesn't help his nervousness. “What if this disciple wins?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mn?” Shen Jiu turns around, surprised to find his disciples there. Seeing Ning Yingying, he again notices insecurity. She is only there because Shen Yuan has promised him that nothing will happen to her since she has another key role in Luo Binghe's future. “Everything. It is not a bet, it is a promise.” He ruffles his hair before turning his back on his and continuing on his way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they arrive at the location where the Alliance Conference will be held, it is an open secret that the hateful and arrogant Shen Qingqiu is boasting that his disciple will win everyone. That has unexpected consequences: now everyone wants to challenge him with stupid bets. Shen Jiu ignores all of them, not out of insecurity, but because he doesn't want to waste his time. He only has two more goals: to fleece the old palace master and Yue Qingyuan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Unfortunately, Yue Qingyuan never falls for his tricks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shidi should be more careful,” he comments to him as they both walk through the stands dedicated to the masters.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu wants to trick him into betting the truth on why he never returned to rescue him, but Yue Qingyuan dodges all of his traps. Annoyed, Shen Jiu goes off to watch the show accompanied by Liu Qingge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your disciple is not in the top ten yet,” he comments, too animated.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu huffs. Although Shen Yuan had already warned him that a lot of brats would take advantage of Luo Binghe in the beginning, the sight of them pissed him off. He has trained his own so that only the most qualified are in Jue Di Gorge. The Huan Hua Palace should train it's own better and show off less. Shen Jiu squeezes his fan tightly, looking forward to the moment when Luo Binghe gets rid of those vermin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because of their bets, everyone is keeping an eye on Luo Binghe, ignoring the other disciples who are in the top ranks. There is a suppressed exclamation when Luo Binghe stumbles upon a huge monster. And there is several applause as Ning Yingying, Ming Fan, and Liu Mingyan steal his prey.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu ignores the teasing from the others and frowns suspiciously. That wasn’t part of Shen Yuan's warnings.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nor did Luo Binghe decide at that moment to go on his own and abandon everyone who followed him.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Strange, </span>
</em>
<span>he thinks, his gaze fixed Luo Binghe’s figure slaughtering monsters. </span>
<em>
<span>He should continue with those useless kids until the Nu yuan chan appears. Bah, that’s better.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Despite his confidence, Shen Jiu begins to tense up, as not only has Luo Binghe entered the top early, Liu Mingyan is also surprising all expectations. Qi Qingqi approaches the two of them without hiding her satisfied smile. Both exchange a challenging look as Liu Qingge nods each time his sister scores more than Luo Binghe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The fact that Shen Jiu, despite arrogantly boasting that his disciple is the best, has only bet with two people, makes everyone cheering for the rest of the disciples and savoring his impending defeat. Everyone wishes to see him defeated, but the game changes when the legendary monsters Shen Yuan warned him about appear. </span>
<em>
<span>Finally</span>
</em>
<span>, he thinks with a smirk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Who laughs last, laughs best.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although all of Cang Qiong Sect's disciples have the necessary tools to survive without difficulty, Luo Binghe is the only one who continues to climb ranks at legendary speed. Unfortunately, no one has noticed it, because everyone is more concerned thinking about how to save the disciples.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Oh, Shen Jiu will laugh a lot when everything is over and the others find out the ranking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>All cultivators are divided into those with the martial skills to defeat monsters, those who will focus on saving disciples, and the healers. Shen Jiu is part of the first group and flies together with Liu Qingge into Jue Di Gorge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Since Liu Mingyan is in the north and Luo Binghe is in the south, the two will be separated. In a fit, Shen Jiu grabs Liu Qingge's arm. It's stupid, but according to Shen Yuan, he should already be dead.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Be careful, shidi.” He growls. “I will never forgive you if something happens to you before enjoying my prize.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge proudly puffs out his chest and gives him a confident smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course, who do you think I am?” His smile suddenly disappears. “Be careful you too. If you are in danger, use a signal. No matter where you are, I will find you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu feels warmth inside his chest, but also a cold past, an echo of his worst memories. They part without saying anything else and he rushes to find Luo Binghe. Despite the chaos around him and the monsters he has to kill, his mind is clear. Shen Jiu repeats to himself the corny, cheesy speech Shen Yuan wrote to him. Shen Jiu believes that Shen Yuan is exaggerating, even so, he will respect the script.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He finds Luo Binghe fighting human-headed spiders. At least that part is correct. Despite all the changes, important things happen just as Shen Yuan predicted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu lands gracefully after slaughtering a few human-headed spiders. They are disgusting and nasty critters.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shizun!” Luo Binghe exclaims, with too-bright eyes and an immense smile improper in a distressing situation. “You've come for us!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have come for you.” He clicks his tongue in disdain before turning his head to stare at the others. Obviously, not from his sect. “Why should I waste my time with some useless brats who are delaying my disciple? Come on, move.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Even though they bow their heads, they follow him obediently. Shen Jiu guides them ignoring Luo Binghe's intense blush. They go to a place that is part of the scheme that Shen Yuan made for him. The plan is simple: leave the disciples in a safe place and accompany Luo Binghe to where the rift into the Abyss will open. As they walk, Shen Jiu watches over the useless as he allows Luo Binghe to slaughter the monsters. After all, he has to win.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Binghe!” He calls him. “I suspect there is a Moon Python Rhinoceros near, do you think you can defeat it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course, shizun!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know. That's why I trust you to keep an eye on the surroundings while I get rid of the clumsiest ones.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu missed a meaningful glance at Luo Binghe's sword. </span>
<em>
<span>Goodbye, Zheng Yang. Hello, eternal delicious meals. </span>
</em>
<span>He is in an excellent mood when he takes the other disciples, who look at him without hiding their hatred. Obviously, they are from the Huan Hua Palace: spoiled, emotional, but without common sense. When they reach the safe place, Shen Jiu discovers that Shang Qinghua is already there with more disciples. Some are from the Cang Qiong Sect who seem more prepared than the Peak Lord.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I leave you to these, shidi. Keep an eye on them.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shen-shixiong! Where are you going!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have left my disciple alone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your disciple? Great, great. Go with him!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu returns to Luo Binghe's side. The boy is surrounded by an unnatural, false calm, which Shen Jiu knows will soon break.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shizun!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is there any sign of the Moon Python Rhinoceros?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He shakes his head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not yet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, it will appear soon.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>For the first time, Shen Yuan is wrong.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No Moon Python Rhinoceros appears, but a demon with pale skin like frost.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu frowns. He can feel the power of that demon despite the distance. His presence freezes the atmosphere. As hasty as ever, Luo Binghe steps in front of him with his sword already drawn, but Shen Jiu ruthlessly pushes him away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t be an idiot!” He growls. “He is out of your level. Go find that Moon Python Rhinoceros, I'll take care of the demon.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But shizun...”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Despite how heavy and insistent Shen Yuan was with the damn script, he has never been the problem, but everyone else. Starting with his stubborn disciple.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Go!” He exclaims when the demon attacks them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The demon is also off his level, but Shen Jiu is cunning and knows how to survive. His foolish disciple will only get killed and that will ruin his perfect future, Shen Yuan's life and he will run out of delicious meals. Checking that Luo Binghe doesn’t leave, Shen Jiu creates a barrier between the two and blocks the demon's ice attacks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not bad for a mortal,” his enemy concedes. “But not enough.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu raises an eyebrow. The demon has the same stupid arrogance as Liu Qingge, so he will use the same tricks: fighting dirty.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a few minutes, the demon eats his own words and various fire spells.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe cheers him on with admiration which is stressful. The brat should be watching for the arrival of the Moon Python Rhinoceros, not his shizun. Shen Jiu dodges several ice spears and uses his fan to direct his qi into the demon's eyes. If he had no other priorities, he could try to catch him and interrogate him later about the sabotage. Sadly, he has a very busy schedule: saving an idiot, ensuring that the idiot breaks his sword by destroying a Moon Python Rhinoceros, delivering a cheesy speech to convince the idiot to jump into the Endless Abyss, and giving him the directions where he will find a new sword. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Waiting for five years for the idiot to return with Shen Yuan and a tamed Liu Qingge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His perfect plan breaks through the barrier when the demon's power hits it. Although Shen Jiu has dodged the ice blocks, the demonic qi has left him dizzy and he recoils to catch his breath. In that interval of doubt, the idiot intervenes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“LUO BINGHE! IF HE DOESN'T KILL YOU I WILL.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>With insulting ease, the demon smashes Zheng Yang.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Well, one thing is done. </span>
</em>
<span>Shen Jiu huffs. Although that means Luo Binghe will no longer be able to face the Moon Python Rhinoceros. Reluctantly, he pops the signal to summon Liu Qingge and pounces on the demon to save his disciple. But the demon eludes him. He has grabbed Luo Binghe by the neck and is looking at him with an interest that he has never devoted to Shen Jiu in a single moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Neither human nor demon. Interesting.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, he brushes his forehead with a finger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu pulls away when a wave of demonic qi leaves Luo Binghe's body. Paralyzed, he sees how a demonic seal is drawn on the young man's skin. The ice demon finally frees Luo Binghe, who falls to his knees.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And with an immense roar, the Endless Abyss opens.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The air smells of sulfur and blood. The landscape has been destroyed by ice and now the fire illuminates them. Shen Jiu stares frozen at Luo Binghe, who struggles to get up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You are a demon,” he splutters. “You...”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Reality hits him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan has lied to him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan knew it. Shen Yuan has known this from the beginning and has been deceiving him. All the pieces begin to fit together: Shen Yuan knew about the demonic invasion and the sabotage of the Alliance Conference because he is in league with the demons. Shen Yuan has tricked him into training a powerful demon.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu notices a familiar, bitter taste in his throat: the disappointment of trusting the wrong person. Of course, someone who has tried to kill you to usurp you is an enemy. That was why Shen Yuan had insisted so much on being at that moment. He is a traitor. A liar.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shizun, I...”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe tries to get closer to him but stops when Shen Jiu raises his sword. He ignores the brat's tears to look at him with disgust and contempt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You shouldn't be here, monster.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shizun! I don't want to hurt anyone!” Luo Binghe raises his hands before taking another tentative step. “I don't want to be a demon! I just want to stay by your side...”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jump.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe opens his eyes with horror. Shen Jiu has erased the cloying speech about the glorious destiny that awaits Luo Binghe to convince him to jump. Still, despite the rage of a betrayal, Shen Jiu clings to the memory of Shen Yuan caring for him when he was injured, striving to teach all the disciples to survive.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He needs to believe that Shen Yuan is not bad. But for Shen Yuan to answer his questions, he needs to live and Luo Binghe must fall into hell.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shizun, why?” He has dropped his arms and cries tears as red as the seal that shines on his forehead. “Do you hate demons that much?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu grits his teeth. That damn brat never listens to him. Furious, but also scared by someone who doesn't deserve it, Shen Jiu extends the sword and skewers it across Luo Binghe's chest. Not to pierce his heart but as a warning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you don't jump, I'll kill you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>When you have been betrayed so many times, it is easy to turn your heart to stone and ignore the bleak gaze of a child who has had to grow up too soon. Luo Binghe, stubborn, doesn’t move. Shen Jiu grits his teeth. The situation is too troublesome: Liu Qingge will soon arrive, at any moment others will appear. If they discover him with a demon, he will be accused of sabotage and will sink the reputation of the sect. However, none of that is what really worries him. But the safety of Shen Yuan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Believing in Shen Yuan means becoming a villain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And that’s how Shen Qingqiu pushed Luo Binghe into the Endless Abyss.</span>

<p>
<span>Liu Qingge lands on an ice-shattered paramo. The ground is cracked and smoke emerges from the rifts. It reeks of blood and brimstone. Amid that desolate chaos, Shen Qingqiu stands out. His green clothes shine, also the blood that stains his sword.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shen Qingqiu!” He yells, running to his side, Cheng Luan drew in his hand. Despite the worry pounding through his veins, Liu Qingge remains alert to potential threats. “Are you hurt?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu shakes his head, although his gaze is clouded. He seems to be looking into infinity, into nowhere. Despite Liu Qingge's uneasy questions, Shen Qingqiu refuses to answer. Perhaps he has even stopped listening to him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Suddenly, Shen Qingqiu crouches down and begins to pick up the shards of a sword. One by one. The pieces were mixed with frost and Liu Qingge hadn't seen it at first.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shen Qingqiu, are you okay?” He insists, grabbing his arm so that he looks into his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No.” Although Shen Qingqiu's face is serene, his eyes burn. “I’m furious.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan hates waiting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He has always been an impatient reader. He even paid for chapters of the infamous PIDW novel because he needed to know what was going to happen! But now, he has no choice but to wait. And without clocks, alone and in silence, time slides too slow. Shen Yuan notices how impatience grows under his skin like an entourage of ants. His only company is a sleeping cat, bestiaries he can't focus on, and the System's voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Despite all his questions, the System's answer is always the same: </span>
<em>
<span>The story is progressing correctly.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Until his vision turns red and a countdown appears, racing his pulse. Until the numbers freeze and the System congratulates him for having passed the Alliance Conference Arc. And then Shen Yuan knows with absolute certainty: Luo Binghe has fallen into the Endless Abyss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When he first read it, Shen Yuan felt fury at the hateful Shen Qingqiu and the injustices Luo Binghe had suffered. Now he is afraid. It is a frosty fear like mist, spreading from his chest to the rest of his body. Shen Yuan closes his eyes and in the tranquility of his house, he wishes that Luo Binghe doesn’t suffer and he returns soon. Without revenge, no ridiculously large harems, and they return to those days with Luo Binghe keeping watch whenever Liu Qingge arrives unannounced and Shen Jiu acting like a sullen cat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Again, Shen Yuan waits.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sleep weighs on his eyelids when he finally hears noises outside. Shen Yuan's pulse has quickened. According to the System, everything went well. But he feels doubt in his lungs. Inadvertently, Shen Yuan holds his breath as he hears familiar footsteps heading towards Qing Jing Peak.</span>
</p><p>
<span>If all has gone well, the only missing disciple will be Luo Binghe. No one else has been hurt and Shen Jiu and he won’t be haunted by any future torture.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Why is he so nervous?</span>
</p><p>
<span>The door is forcefully opened and Shen Yuan takes a step forward, impatient, but his legs freeze when Shen Jiu glares at him. It is a furious and terrifying look, and Shen Yuan suddenly wishes to disappear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You lied to me,” Shen Jiu groans after slamming the door shut. “That beast is a demon.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” He splutters, without understanding what he's talking about. ”Wait! Wait! What are you talking about?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan watches wide-eyed as Shen Jiu flashes a cruel smile. That is the true face of the PIDW scum villain. And it is terrifying. His gaze leaves Shen Yuan speechless and trembling. However, there is a glint of disappointment in his eyes before Shen Jiu grabs a package from his sleeve and throws it. Zheng Yang's shards spread across the ground before Shen Yuan's feet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you still trying to fool me? Do you want me to believe that you didn't know that Luo Binghe is actually a demon and we have trained our enemy?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan just wants to hide. His accusations make him dizzy, his head hurts. He gazes at the shards of the sword as if it were Luo Binghe's corpse. </span>
<em>
<span>What has gone wrong? I don’t understand… </span>
</em>
<span>Shen Jiu keeps talking, vomiting angry words as he remains paralyzed by the silence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is how you found out, right? The demonic invasion, the sabotage of the Alliance Conference, and Luo Binghe's demonic heritage. This is why your information is so selective. You are an ally of the demons.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan finally raises his head. Something gurgles in his chest, a combination of fear and anger. Despite his rage, Shen Jiu suddenly no longer scares him. Perhaps because he seems tired, about to break down. And his weakness gives Shen Yuan the strength to dare to speak.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course I knew,” he splutters in a whisper. “I told you. I tried to tell you. This is something that I couldn't tell you directly, so I found another way to tell you.” The System beeps in his head, but he ignores it. He is no longer breaking any rules since the villain has already discovered the nature of the protagonist. “Of course I told you! I told you that Luo Binghe would survive in a place where all humans die and only the most powerful demons triumph! I told you that he would master a demon sword! I told you that he would unite both realms starting with ruling the Demon Realm! I told you that he would have demonic wives! And you told me you understood!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan screams until he runs out of air. Fear pulses in his chest, right over his heart, until it suffocates him. In front of him, Shen Jiu's eyes wides in horror. Pale and confused, he no longer says anything.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought you knew it,” he adds with weariness and frustration. “In this story, Shen Qingqiu is Luo Binghe's worst enemy. He will return for revenge. After five years in hell, he will return to destroy everything: Cang Qiong Mountain Sect, the Human Realm... you too. The two of us now.” He adds bitterly. "That's what I was trying to change. I was hoping that if we convinced Luo Binghe to jump instead of pushing him, the future would be different."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan doesn't need Shen Jiu to say anything to know that that future has already been broken.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shit,” he growls angrily, as panic begins to spread throughout his body. “What have you done?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He is terrified of hearing the truth. Because sometimes a single gesture is enough to destroy all good memories and darken a heart.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I pierced Xiu Ya in his chest.” Shen Jiu speaks in a monotone voice. He lowered his head and stares blankly at the shards of Zheng Yang scattered on the ground. They shine like fallen stars. “And I pushed him to the Abyss.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan is trembling. Because all his nightmares have grown and come true, locking him in a book whose terrible end has just been decided.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>They remain in silence for a few minutes. Shen Jiu can feel Shen Yuan's panic, immense and absorbing, a shadow that covers the bamboo house. However, he doesn’t say or do anything. In his head, there is only space for all those screams against himself. Shen Yuan hasn’t tricked him. Shen Yuan didn’t want to lie to him. It is he who misinterpreted his words. It is he who met Luo Binghe's painful gaze and drew the worst of conclusions. It is he who has condemned them all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Slowly, very slowly, Shen Jiu puts a hand to his head as he closes his eyes. Perhaps his destiny has always been destruction. Shen Yuan is the one who saves lives while he snatches them. It’s Shen Yuan who makes people friends and happy, he only brings suffering.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Maybe he should be left alone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Now what?” He mutters, too tired to mend his indifferent facade. “Tell me. What will happen when Luo Binghe returns in five years?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He will make you his prisoner. He... will torture you.” There is an inflection in his voice that reveals that there is something else that Shen Yuan doesn’t dare to utter. “He will kill monsters, find strange treasures, conquer all sects and merge both realms. No one will stop him.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I understand.” Shen Jiu takes a deep breath. “Leave.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Shen Yuan looks at him in confusion. It's so surreal to see those emotions on his own face. Shen Yuan gives his features a touch of vulnerability, of sincerity, that betrays him as a different person.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Have I not been clear enough? Get out. Now.” Shen Jiu turns his back on him. “I have created this mess, I will fix it. Get out. Right now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He intends to store his luggage and rest after a horrible night, however, the fool of Shen Yuan grabs his arm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Haven’t you understood me? No one will be able to stop Luo Binghe! And you are the person he will want to do the most harm to! And he will.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu clicks his tongue dismissively. He still has a hard time imagining his disciple as a terrifying enemy. Also that the brat is capable of doing even more damage to him than he suffered in the past.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You didn't want to be me. Don't be. Get away from the sect and Luo Binghe's revenge. Use your name, dress as you want, and travel to find those monsters that you are so passionate about.” Shen Jiu grabs Shen Yuan's hand to coldly push him away. “One Shen Qingqiu is enough.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Perhaps Shen Jiu recognizes that Shen Yuan is a good person. He is the one who only sees the worst in people and is fooled by his own anger. During all those years he has strived to create a perfect facade to hide everything that is broken inside. Shen Jiu only knows how to hurt, but for once he wants to protect someone.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>So go away. Please. You have made me stop feeling lonely, but I have only condemned you to death. That's not fair. Go away and don't let Luo Binghe ever find you. Take the cat, those books, and all your ridiculous ideas. You are the closest thing I have to a friend and that is why I don’t want anything bad happening to you. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu averts his gaze, preventing Shen Yuan from reading his true thoughts in his eyes. He has to pretend to be cold and cruel. It's better if Shen Yuan hates him. Only the living can hate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No.” Shen Yuan intercepts him, stubborn and defiant. “I stay. I have nowhere to go and I will not abandon anyone. I know what will happen, I... I'll change it! I promise you! I will find a way to change the future!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu listens to him wrapped in a feeling of uncertainty. He is unable to believe Shen Yuan, too naive, too optimistic. The world is cruel and happiness doesn’t exist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But…</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan can go. Nothing impedes him. Shen Yuan may go away and be selfish, but he has decided to stay. That certainty cuts through all his doubts. Shen Jiu may have gotten used to Shen Yuan's presence, but he has always distrusted him. He also doesn’t know how to trust other people. Everyone abandons him, they judge him, they hate him. But Shen Yuan has decided to stay.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Qi-Ge left, Shen Yuan no.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Suddenly, Shen Jiu feels his eyes sting. He needs all of his self-control to keep from breaking down in tears. He can trust Shen Yuan. He will never be alone again. He can trust someone who has had the opportunity to betray him and has not. He is no longer alone with his fears.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Can.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Trust.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And he promises that he will and will never distrust him again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine,” he growls, turning his head. “It's late, tomorrow we will talk about Luo Binghe's problem. Go to sleep.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>After so long, that night Shen Jiu has a nightmare again.</span>

<p>Thanks to his amazing talent, Liu Qingge has always overcome all the challenges that he has set for himself. Generally, they are physical, like mastering a new technique or defeating a monster. However, ever since Shen Qingqiu invited him to eat at his house after bragging about his disciple's culinary techniques, Liu Qingge has started to feel that he can do it too. And better.</p><p>His first attempt, a few pastries that he offered Shen Qingqiu on the way to the Alliance Conference, were a moderate success. However, the Alliance Conference was a failure and now Liu Qingge has another reason to improve his cooking. Despite the monsters' threat, Cang Qiong Mountain Sect only lost one disciple, the same one that Shen Qingqiu bragged so much about, the same one who nonetheless won.</p><p>Since Liu Qingge lost the bet, he regularly visits Qing Jing Peak. Shen Qingqiu's mood swings are more sudden. Sometimes he is unbearable and sometimes he smiles at him as if he had forgotten that the day before he yelled at him for punching a hole in the wall. Sometimes he gets lost in his thoughts and worries cloud his gaze.</p><p>Like the good friend that he is, Liu Qingge wants to make Shen Qingqiu feel better and that is what motivates him to improve his culinary technique.</p><p>Today he makes pork rice and fried tofu in garlic sauce. His new routine consists of training before the sun rises, cooking, training more, and heading to Qing Jing Peak. Like every day, something inside Liu Qingge writhes in doubt about what Shen Qingqiu's mood will be like. As he approaches the bamboo house, he recognizes a figure dressed in green who is reading some scrolls sitting in the garden. Liu Qingge would love to erase that worried look and promise him that he will never let anything bad happen to him ever again.</p><p>But Liu Qingge was late and was unable to save his disciple.</p><p>“Oh, Liu-shidi!” Shen Qingqiu raises his head from the scrolls to look at him. “It is always a pleasant surprise to see you again.”</p><p>Liu Qingge nods. It seems Shen Qingqiu is in a good mood today. At the same time, he seems especially restless. Shen Qingqiu picks up the scrolls with impatient, too abrupt movements. Liu Qingge kneels, but Shen Qingqiu rejects his help with a smile.</p><p>“Did Liu-shidi bring something to eat?” He asks when the two enter the bamboo house. His gaze is undisguisedly hanging on the package Liu Qingge is carrying.</p><p>Although Shen Qingqiu still hasn't recognized that his food is the best, Liu Qingge is satisfied to make Shen Qingqiu's smile shine. Even when he's in a worse mood, Shen Qingqiu receives his food with a lot of enthusiasm and that makes him feel happy. And fills Liu Qingge with the determination to keep improving.</p><p>The food is still hot thanks to some talismans. They both sit at the table and Shen Qingqiu prepares dishes. The first week Liu Qingge started cooking for him, Shen Qingqiu left half the plate to <em> eat later </em>, so now Liu Qingge does twice as much so Shen Qingqiu won't starve.</p><p>When they eat together, Liu Qingge doesn’t usually speak. He listens quietly to Shen Qingqiu's talk, although since the Alliance Conference Shen Qingqiu is usually lost in brooding silences. Sometimes, when he's grumpy, he hardly says anything. Today is one of those days when Shen Qingqiu is in high spirits and speaks for both of them.</p><p>A white cat smoothly walks over to sit on Shen Qingqiu's lap, who gives him bits of food too enthusiastically.</p><p>“You never told me what its name is,” Liu Qingge comments.</p><p>“It still has no name. We have a little debate... between my disciples and me, of course!” Shen Qingqiu laughs, strangely nervous. “I had thought of Copycat since it reminds me of someone.”</p><p>Liu Qingge doesn't know what <em> Copycat </em>means, but he agrees with him: the cat reminds him of Shen Qingqiu, specifically the past Shen Qingqiu before he saved his life. Of course, he decides to shut it up so as not to provoke his bad mood.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Since the night Shen Jiu decided to trust Shen Yuan, he has barely slept. Nightmares haunt him, plague his chest with restless worries that race his pulse. He is more nervous, tired, and upset, but all those fears that grow during the night also force him to act before the five years are gone.</p><p>Today, Shen Jiu shows up at An Ding Peak without warning, startling Shang Qinghua. Despite the obvious nervousness of his shidi, Shang Qinghua has no choice but to invite him to his house and serve him tea.</p><p>“What is the pleasure, Shen-shixiong?” He asks with an uneasy voice and the same panic in his eyes when someone brings up budgets in the meetings. “Do you want to talk about the reforms of your house?”</p><p>“Not today.” That is a pending task. He first reformed the house to keep Shen Yuan's existence a secret. Now, he wants to make it a more pleasant place. “It is another matter that brings me here. Tell me, Shang-shidi, when did you start colluding with demons?”</p><p>Shang Qinghua drops his teacup on the ground. He has turned pale and his hands are shaking as he begins to stutter.</p><p>“Wha-what are you talking about, Shen-shixiong?”</p><p>When he misinterpreted Shen Yuan, his impulsiveness linked two events. That same night, after calming down, Shen Jiu continued to value those ideas from a different approach.</p><p>“It’s suspicious that Cang Qiong Mountain Sect suffered two demonic attacks in such a short time. Attacks that share the same chance: demons couldn’t have done it alone.” Shen Qingqiu puts down his cup of tea and slaps the table with his fan to accompany his words. “First, the invasion.” Hit. “Someone told the demons when the sect would be most unprotected.” Hit. “Next, the sabotage of the Alliance Conference.” Hit. “Someone helped the demons infiltrate those monsters.” Hit. “Any sect could have contributed to the sabotage, but only someone from Cang Qiong knew when we would be most vulnerable.” Hit. “Of course, the Cang Qiong Sect is immense, but only a Peak Lord possesses all of this information.”</p><p>And narrowing down between the twelve Peak Lords had been very simple once he remembered that Shang Qinghua was the main one in charge of organizing the Alliance Conference. With that suspicion in mind, Shen Jiu began looking for other clues that would give him away.</p><p>“There are several reasons why I understood that it could only be you, but the most important one happened at the Alliance Conference.” He continues, pointing the fan at him. “My disciple and I were attacked by a demon after I said goodbye to you. It was strange, do you know why, Shang Qinghua?” He refuses to call that traitor shidi again. “There were many monsters, but not a single demon. That was the only demon and he came to specifically attack us.”</p><p>Shang Qinghua listened to him with his mouth open and terror reflected in his eyes. It was a real mystery how he had deceived them when little theories without proof were enough to unmask him.</p><p>“Fortunately for you, I have recently challenged a powerful demon.” Shen Qingqiu retrieves his cup of tea with a sly smirk. “And I'd like to have a spy to tell me what he's doing and what he's planning. If you don't like it, I can always talk to Zhangmen-shixiong.”</p><p>In fact, Shen Jiu doesn't trust Yue Qingyuan's judgment. He is too good and soft, capable of forgiving a treacherous rat or ignoring his accusations for lack of evidence. However, Shang Qinghua doesn’t know this. The important thing is that he believes that Shen Jiu has the power to destroy him with a single word.</p><p>“Shen-shixiong, I… I...” Shang Qinghua babbles unable to formulate coherent words.</p><p>“You what? Didn't you want to do it? It's too late for that.”</p><p>Shang Qinghua bows his head. For a moment, Shen Jiu fears that the cultivator will end up in a qi deviation.</p><p>“Do you want me to spy on Luo Binghe for you?” He finally splutters, stunned and on the verge of a nervous breakdown.</p><p>“I never said Luo Binghe is a demon. But yes.”</p><p>“You're going to get us to kill both of us.”</p><p>“I have no intention of that beast killing me.” <em> Not to put his hands on Shen Yuan. </em>“Of course, I won't let you try to betray me either. If you don't like my conditions, we can talk to Zhangmen-shixiong.”</p><p>“Wait! Wait! Shen-shixiong!”</p><p>“Shen Qingqiu for you.”</p><p>Shang Qinghua wrings his hands nervously before closing his eyes and taking a deep breath.</p><p>“How can I help you? My... source of information is limited and right now your disciple is out of my reach.”</p><p>Shen Jiu smiles, savoring his victory.</p><p>“I want you to tell me absolutely all the details about how you infiltrated the demons in the sect and the monsters in the Alliance Conference. I want to know more about that ice demon and the current state of the Demon Realm. I want you to keep me informed about Luo Binghe's movements. I want you to double my salary.”</p><p>“Why do you want…?”</p><p>“Is there a problem, Shang Qinghua?”</p><p>“No! No! No!”</p><p>“Great,” his smile becomes more treacherous and crooked. “And don't forget: if I fall, you will fall with me.”</p><p>Shen Jiu is in a good mood when he returns to Qing Jing Peak. His visit to An Ding Peak is a little secret since he doesn't want to worry Shen Yuan. Shen Jiu knows that Shen Yuan is terrified, although he tries to hide it behind a carefree smile. It is because of Shen Yuan that he won't sit idly by for five years. <em> Come back when you dare, Luo Binghe</em>, he thinks. <em> I'll be ready. </em></p>

<p>What Shen Yuan admires the most about Shen Jiu is his impudence.</p><p>He is the only one capable of announcing without his voice shaking that he will be leaving on a little trip. Alone. With a carriage just for him. No, Ning Yingying, this teacher doesn't need any help. No, Ming Fan, he doesn't need anyone to drive that carriage.</p><p>If Shen Yuan wasn't so stressed out, he would have found it funny.</p><p>Shen Yuan has a plan. The plan is still not very good. In fact, it is so ambiguous that Shen Jiu scoffs with his characteristic malice saying that it is not even a plan. Well, it's better than nothing.</p><p>First, they need to improve Shen Qingqiu's image. And Shen Jiu isn't helping by scaring Shang Qinghua for no reason and making decisions that may seem conceited, outlandish, and absurd.</p><p>Okay, they need a carriage to get the two of them out of the sect without being discovered. But they also need a reason to take a carriage, in addition to "Shen Qingqiu does whatever he wants." So, Shen Yuan insists until Shen Jiu yields. Now, Shen Qingqiu has taken a carriage because he is going to look for medicinal plants. His decisions are now understandable and they also get merits with Mu Qingfang. Great job!</p><p>Second, they need to prepare for Luo Binghe's arrival.</p><p>And so, that morning the two of them sneak out of Cang Qiong Mountain Sect: Shen Yuan hiding inside the carriage and Shen Jiu driving it. It's exciting and a bit scary in case they are discovered. To avoid meddling, Shen Jiu has made them get up early at an inhuman hour. </p><p>Perhaps Shen Yuan has fallen asleep for the first ten minutes inside the carriage while leaving the mountain.</p><p>Finally away from the sect, Shen Jiu stops for Shen Yuan to come out and sit by his side.</p><p>Despite Luo Binghe’s threat, who occupies all his thoughts and robs his peace of mind, Shen Yuan allows himself to relax that day. It is the first time since the Shang Hu City mission that he has left the sect and is nervous, excited, and impatient. The morning seems even brighter outside than from the bamboo house.</p><p>He sighs, closing his eyes as the sun caresses his face.</p><p>“You look happy,” Shen Jiu comments. He speaks without looking at him, his attention fixed on the road. His voice sounds less harsh, almost soft.</p><p>“It’s a nice day!”</p><p>Something has changed since the Alliance Conference. Shen Yuan believed, seeing him so angry and upset, that Shen Jiu hated him. He still doesn't understand why he decided to help him. Shen Jiu is Shen Qingqiu, the villain he hated, the reason behind Luo Binghe's suffering. Shen Yuan should have fled to save his own life. However, Shen Jiu is not really Shen Qingqiu. He is the person with whom he shares a house and who has started to act almost like a friend. And Shen Yuan is unable to flee, saving his life but condemning Ming Fan and the other disciples, Liu Qingge, and the Peak Lords.</p><p>Something changed. Perhaps he is naive in believing that he can fix everything, even the scum villain. But Shen Jiu is acting differently. He is still an unpleasant and unsympathetic person, spending half his time complaining about everyone and the other half seeking arguments. But not with him. Not anymore. Shen Yuan no longer needs to pluck up the courage to tell him that his attitude towards the carriage has been arrogant since Shen Jiu listens to him. And the two talk until they reach an agreement.</p><p>But Shen Yuan is afraid of making a mistake. Shen Jiu is such a cold person that it is impossible to know his thoughts. Or feelings. Although Shen Yuan has questioned him, Shen Jiu refuses to tell him what he thought of Luo Binghe until he discovered that he was a demon. Or why is he acting so nasty towards Yue Qingyuan and refusing to let Shen Yuan represent Shen Qingqiu if he detests the sect leader so much. Or what he really thinks of Liu Qingge. </p><p>What he thinks about Shen Yuan.</p><p>Shen Yuan is afraid that he has started to consider him a friend, but Shen Jiu is unable to appreciate anyone.</p><p>They travel quietly until silence grows unbearable. Shen Jiu clears his throat before speaking.</p><p>“I know you don't like getting up early, but I could only teach you how to handle the sword correctly when the disciples are sleeping.”</p><p>Shen Yuan looks at him curiously, surprised by his comment.</p><p>"And why not at night?"</p><p>It is no secret that Shen Jiu is suffering from horrible insomnia. Shen Yuan doesn't mind going to bed later to practice music. In his afterlife, he spent almost every night reading and has found that music helps Shen Jiu. Although he would rather have his roommate visit Mu Qingfang.</p><p>“Your qi will flow better if you have rested,” says the same person who never rests. “And I will only allow you to go on missions if you know how to handle Xiu Ya.”</p><p>“Wait!” He exclaims so loudly that even the horses get scared. “Will you let me out of the sect? And with Xiu Ya?”</p><p>“Yes, I hate wasting my time on missions and you like it.” Shen Jiu continues to stare at the road, which adds a touch of nonchalance to his words. “But you can only go if you know how to defend yourself correctly.” <em> Correctly </em> in the language of Shen Jiu means <em> perfectly </em>. “Shen Qingqiu only uses Xiu Ya and it would be strange if we pick up another spirit sword, so yes, I will lend you my sword.” Shen Yua longs for Xiu Ya. It is a stupid dream to believe that was also his sword. “And for that, you need classes. I would also feel calmer if you could protect yourself from Luo Binghe when he returns.”</p><p>Shen Jiu is the only person who grants a favor in a grumpy manner and erases all possible enthusiasm. Even so, Shen Yuan has mixed feelings. He doesn’t know whether to be scared or rejoice. It's confusing because it almost seems like Shen Jiu is worried about him. But it’s surely his imagination.</p><p>A while later, when Shen Yuan feels hungry, he pulls out of his sleeve the package that Liu Qingge has prepared for them. This time its baozi bread. Shen Yuan distributes them by savoring in advance.</p><p>“Do you want me to replace you?” He asks Shen Jiu.</p><p>“Can you drive a carriage?”</p><p>“I can learn!”</p><p>Shen Jiu almost let out a laugh. It’s more of a hiss, but his smile is real and this time Shen Yuan hasn't imagined it.</p><p>“Eat and stop talking nonsense.” And he adds after a pause. “But if you eat my part, you will walk the rest of the way.”</p><p>Shen Yuan laughs. Is it so hard for Shen Jiu to admit that Liu Qingge brings them some really good food? It doesn’t have the legendary level of the protagonist, but it’s getting more and more delicious with time.</p><p>“Who do you think will cook it? Can you imagine it is Liu Qingge?”</p><p>Shen Yuan scores another goal by making Shen Jiu choke on laughter. The idea is as absurd as funny. Shen Yuan is unable to imagine the serious Liu Qingge locked in a kitchen.</p><p>“He would probably use Cheng Luan instead of a knife,” Shen Jiu comments maliciously.</p><p>This time they both laugh at the same time.</p><p>“It has probably been a disciple,” Shen Yuan wonders. “It is also just as rare to imagine a Bai Zhan Peak disciple cooking as Liu Qingge, honestly.”</p><p>“Mn.” Shen Jiu makes a pause that Shen Yuan already recognizes as hesitant. That's weird. Shen Jiu usually always has very clear ideas. Sometimes even too much. “A disciple who cooks instead of training doesn’t fit into Bai Zhan Peak.”</p><p>“Oh!” He turns to him to pick his cheek. “Are they my imaginations or do you seem concerned about an unknown disciple?”</p><p>Shen Jiu growls, turning his face away.</p><p>“I could get you that disciple.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Shen Yuan blinks, confused.</p><p>“Liu Qingge probably won't want them. And they would be more comfortable if they was at Qing Jing Peak than having to bring food from Bai Zhan Peak every day.” As always, everything he says is reasonable. But Shen Yuan is convinced that he recognizes something anomalous in his tone of voice. “And you miss the little beast. Don't fool me, I know. Would you like to have your own disciple?”</p><p>First the sword and now a disciple. It's too many emotions put together and Shen Yuan's head is starting to hurt. That is terrifying! Shen Jiu doesn't seem to appreciate anything or anyone, but his actions lately are contradictory. Shen Yuan doesn't know what to think. Shen Yuan is afraid that he is delusional and is just another misunderstanding.</p><p>“<span>Please, don’t steal anyone’s disciple</span>.” He responds with a sigh.</p><p>“It wouldn’t be the first time.”</p><p>“Shen Jiu!?”</p><p>He's definitely the cheekiest person in the PIDW world.</p><p>They travel to the Bailu Forest without stop talking, gossiping a lot, and dodging the topic of the future. Shen Yuan is tired when they finally reach their destination. A gasp of astonishment escapes him when at last that immense and disproportionate forest.</p><p>“I hope those seeds are there,” Shen Jiu growls, clicking his tongue. “I don't want to explain anything to that old truant.”</p><p>Shen Yuan doesn't ask anything, but Shen Jiu's contempt for the Old Palace Master hasn’t gone unnoticed. Nor is it anyone they need to worry about. But yes, it is better if they avoid attracting the attention of Huan Hua Palace.</p><p>Evidently, a few minutes later they bump into someone from Huan Hua Palace.</p><p>“Master… Shen?” A disciple with age and bearing similar to Luo Binghe mutters.</p><p>As if that weren't enough, the disciple's gaze shifts from one to the other. And although the IQ of the PIDW characters is usually quite low, that young man knows how to do calculations and from his expression, the result of that sum is not what he expected.</p><p>Maybe and only maybe they have been overconfident those days. How many possibilities were there that precisely someone from another sect would be the first to catch them? Uneasy, Shen Yuan raises his fan. Beside him, Shen Jiu has outlined his most arrogant expression, as if daring him to hint that there is something wrong. Obviously, the poor disciple doesn't dare to say anything.</p><p>But maybe he does it later and very dangerous information reaches the wrong ears.</p><p>"This teacher has suffered a temporary complication," Shen Yuan comments, hiding all his nervousness behind a neutral expression. “Have you heard of the Apple with Two Souls?”</p><p>Shen Yuan has immense knowledge of all the shitty plots of PIDW. Understanding what he is referring to, the disciple relaxes and nods. What’s more, Shen Jiu lets out a growl of approval.</p><p>“That was smart,” he compliments him with a whisper.</p><p>They haven’t managed to get rid of the disciple, who has insisted on accompanying them after convincing him that they are just one person and that they are searching for medicinal plants nearby Huan Hua Palace. Shen Yuan considers him to be a very nice boy, avoiding conflicts between sects by keeping his secret.</p><p>But what makes him most excited is the recognition of the eternally fussy and dissatisfied Shen Jiu.</p><p>Unfortunately, Shen Yuan can’t tell him that he knows Apple with Two Souls due to a horrifying chapter in which Luo Binghe and Wife 27? suffer a peculiar incident. By mistake, Wife 32? ate the Apple with Two Souls and split into two separate bodies: a more emotional one that represented her heart and a colder one that represented her logic. The approach was interesting. The two bodies of Wife 38? acted differently despite being the same person, but it became an excuse to end in a threesome.</p><p>“His name is Gongyi Xiao,” Shen Jiu whispers to him again. Shen Yuan stiffens as he recognizes another minor character of the novel. “He is probably the only decent disciple of the Huan Hua Palace.“</p><p>“Probably not, he is,” he says by mistake.</p><p>Obviously, Shen Jiu raises an eyebrow at grasping that information that he shouldn't possess.</p><p>“Is he important in the future?”</p><p>“No. He also will end up miserably. Luo Binghe will send him away for daring to woo his future wife.”</p><p>Shen Jiu nodded. And he continues to be strangely thoughtful, even when Shen Yuan ends up talking to Gongyi Xiao (he's excited, okay? He's another character with incredible potential like Liu Qingge who was wasted by Airplane's terrible storytelling. And Shen Yuan is supposed to be the <em> heart </em> and Shen Jiu <em> logic </em>, so he must be sociable), when they get disturbed by a snake, and when they finally reach the cave.</p><p>He says nothing until he grabs Shen Yuan by the arm before he enters the waters of a lake.</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>“The seeds are in the center of the lake.”</p><p>“Why do you want to get wet when there is a disciple here?” Shen Jiu rolls his eyes before turning to Gongyi Xiao. “Bring us the seeds.”</p><p>Shen Jiu's nerve continues to surprise Shen Yuan.</p><p>The innocent Gongyi Xiao does whatever he asks of them. He brings them the seeds and even listens to Shen Yuan when he tells him to leave the poor demon snake alone since it is harmless. He even offers to guide the carriage while Master Shen recovers from the poisoning.</p><p>“It’s not necessary,” Shen Yuan quickly adds.</p><p>“It’s not a bad idea,” Shen Jiu says at the same time.</p><p>The two Shens look at each other. </p><p>And Gongyi Xiao is smart enough to walk away and leave space for them to argue.</p><p>“If you're tired, I can drive the carriage myself.” Everything would be easier if Shen Jiu recognized his limits. “But we have to return to the Cang Qiong Mountain Sect alone. If they hear the nonsense of the Apple with Two Souls, Mu Qingfang will investigate and he will recognize that we are not poisoned.”</p><p>“I have a better plan,” Shen Jiu says with proud satisfaction. “He takes us to the Cang Qiong Mountain Sect. He stays in Cang Qiong Mountain Sect. Huan Hua Palace doesn’t deserve a disciple with his talents.”</p><p>“What did I tell you about stealing disciples?” Shen Jiu's impudence begins to worry Shen Yuan. ”Furthermore, Luo Binghe will want to destroy our disciples as well. We would be putting him in danger!”</p><p>“He already has a miserable end, what difference does it make? Wouldn't you like to also save him as we are going to save our disciples?”</p><p>“Seriously, Shen Jiu, you can't take people away without even asking them first. And no. We are not doing it.”</p><p>“We are two and he is one.” He growls. “And he seems to admire us and you have liked him. I don’t see the problem.”</p><p>“Huan Hua Palace will probably not think the same.”</p><p>Shen Yuan settled the discussion by returning to the carriage.</p><p>“This teacher appreciates your offer, but we must go.”</p><p>“It was a pleasure, Master Shen!”</p><p>“In gratitude for your services, you can come to visit us whenever you want to Cang Qiong Mountain Sect,” Shen Jiu intervenes without giving up. Shen Yuan can see that he is smiling behind his fan. “This teacher has appreciated your attitude very much and would like to reward you.”</p><p>Shen Yuan tramples him in the subtlest way he can.</p><p>They don't speak again until the two of them get back on the road.</p><p>“Now seriously, which one do you prefer? Liu Qingge's mysterious cook or Gongyi Xiao? Or maybe both?”</p><p>“We are not going to kidnap anybody!”</p><p>“I know. But there are other ways to convince possibly dissatisfied disciples with their teachers.”</p><p>“And antagonize Liu-shidi and the Old Palace Master? We agreed that we were going to improve Shen Qingqiu's image!”</p><p>For a few seconds, Shen Jiu doesn't say anything. Then he clicks his tongue, annoyed.</p><p>“My life used to be better when I didn't have to worry about what other people thought of me.”</p><p>
<em> But now we wouldn’t be in this mess! </em>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Despite the stress of leaving and entering the sect without being discovered, Shen Jiu acknowledges that he has enjoyed that little journey with Shen Yuan. It was fun. He liked that the two of them were alone in a different environment than the bamboo house without fear of being discovered and acting normally. Without neither of them pretending to be someone else.</p><p>His gaze lingers on his Sun and Moon Dew Flower seed. He hasn’t read anything about that plant, but according to Shen Yuan, it will serve to create a second body and escape death. He clenches his fist, holding tight to the seed. Although he hasn't said anything, he doesn't like that plan. Faking his death won't fix Luo Binghe's problem. Shen Yuan has spoken to him of the destruction of the sects, the merge of both realms, of the cruel and unjust deaths. None of that will go away even if Shen Qingqiu does.</p><p>Shen Jiu recognizes that he is not a good person. But he is consistent with his actions. Using Sun and Moon Dew Flower seeds is a cowardly decision. He won’t run away.</p><p>He won’t abandon anyone.</p><p>Of course, he hasn't said anything to Shen Yuan. Because the most selfish part of Shen Jiu is relieved knowing that Shen Yuan has an alternate body and nothing will happen to him.</p><p>“Now we should choose the place where we will plant our bodies!” Shen Yuan comments happily, returning with several maps in his arms. “We should choose a place with a lot of spiritual energy.”</p><p>Although Shen Jiu's expression is empty, his throat is dry.</p><p>“It is better if we look for different places. And keep it a secret.” His gaze stops at the scroll on which Shen Yuan has written down all the information about Luo Binghe's abilities. “You said that with his manipulation of dreams and blood it is almost impossible to keep a secret from him. In that case, we should not know the location of the other's body. You know, in the worst case one gets caught we couldn’t say anything.”</p><p>That is a very cowardly lie. Because Shen Jiu keeps his seed in a box and hides it deep inside the bamboo house.</p>

<p>
<span>Shen Jiu tries to read, but he feels an uncertainty in his heart that prevents him from concentrating. Although Shen Yuan has already gone out several times on short trips outside of the sect, this is his first mission. Succubi are simple demons to defeat and Liu Qingge accompanies him, but... worry has become entangled in his shadow and doesn’t leave him alone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, he hears steps. Shen Jiu doesn't move, refusing to show vulnerability, even though inside he is happy that Shen Yuan has returned. The door opens and Shen Yuan enters the bamboo house. Shen Jiu frowns upon seeing him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why are you soaked?” His voice escapes, strangled with disgust. “Your hair is a mess! What happened?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Liu-shidi has been affected by the succubi’s poison,” he grunts, leaving the remains of a paper fan on the table. Shen Jiu recognizes him as one of Shen Yuan's favorites. “I had to throw him into cold water. He has pushed me for revenge.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu puts a sleeve over his mouth to hide a smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please, tell me what happened.” He clears his throat to stifle a laugh. “Despite our classes, has our dear shidi been fooled? Oh, I would have loved to see him drenched like a cat!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan, on the other hand, has no qualms about laughing. He has always been the more open of the two and barely hides it anymore, but Shen Jiu doesn't care.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“His expression has been very funny! And he does act a little like a cat. He almost snorted at me, all soaked and disheveled!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu hums, fanning himself languidly, as he tries to picture the pristine and ever-perfect Liu Qingge with his hair in his face, perhaps his tousled ponytail and wet clothes clinging to his muscles. He shakes his head before a mischievous daydream turns into something else.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge walks down Bai Zhan Peak with impatient steps. Despite the cold water bath, he still feels a warmth in his chest spreading to his face. His disciples, clever and cunning, flee when they see him. They recognize that he is nervous and wanting perhaps to hit something until he rips off that heat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before reaching his rooms, he catches a random disciple.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shen Qingqiu’s bestiary,” he demands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge remembers very well the classes that Shen Qingqiu gave on poisonous beasts and that all the disciples received a book written by him. And right now, with the succubus venom still under his skin, he needs that book.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Or ask for help, but his pride prevents it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Back home, Liu Qingge takes off his crown and wet clothes. Half naked, he sits in a lotus posture and opens the bestiary to find the succubus section. Although he didn’t give importance to the succubi, too weak demons that he had already faced, he heard the lesson twice. His cheeks burn at the thought that he, despite everything, has fallen into such an obvious trap. And on top of it, in front of Shen Qingqiu! It's a miracle that his shixiong still hasn't made fun of him. Liu Qingge deserves it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge knew the risks of succubi and that is precisely why he offered to accompany Shen Qingqiu, worried that those devious demons would try something. Succubi stalk attractive mortals, and Shen Qingqiu is one of the most beautiful in the sect. (Something inside Liu Qingge trembles as he remembers how Shen Qingqiu has mocked him and his </span>
<em>
<span>pretty face</span>
</em>
<span>.)</span>
</p><p>
<span>However, the protector was the one affected by Madame Meiyin's words.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Um… the other party is younger than you.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge gulps, recalling the succubus prediction with a racing pulse.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Your first meeting was unpleasant. You may have disliked each other, even. However, a crucial event happened and led to you turning your relationship around.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Two very different memories, drenched in bewilderment, shame, and the same warmth he feels now, shake him: the first time he was affected by succubus venom. He returned to the sect even more restless than now and did not stop until he found Shen Qingqiu and challenged him to a duel. At that time he couldn't stand him. But then Shen Qingqiu rescued him from his qi deviation and saved his life.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Since then, their relationship has changed forever.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>This person is always by your side.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>His breathing quickens, thinking of that month he visited Qing Jing Peak every day. Shen Qingqiu scolded him for his manners and he silenced him with food. Sometimes they even played weiqi.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>You have saved each other’s lives. Your destined one rarely pays attention to those around them, Immortal Master. However, once they come to care about someone, they do it full-heartedly, without any reservations.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge covers his face with both hands while letting out a groan. Until Shen Qingqiu saved his life, he was always outside the sect traveling, seeking threats, and hunting monsters. Now…</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>A beauty second to none.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu thinks that he has a pretty face. He's been messing with his looks all morning.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Exceptional potential, powerful spiritual energy. They come from a distinguished household and descended from a noble bloodline.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge knows that the succubus' words sought to confuse them and then attack them (which she did). Yet where did she get so much information from? Did she know that he came from the famous Liu lineage?</span>
</p><p>
<span>His gaze desperately searches for those answers in the bestiary. Sadly, Shen Qingqiu only wrote about the poison and there are hardly a few lines dedicated to the prophetic abilities of the succubi. According to Shen Qingqiu, they are limited and very specific. Succubi can read mortal hearts, distinguish soulmates, and recognize love.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>They might part for a short time, but they’ll meet again quickly. It is Immortal Master’s fated one who does the chasing. I’m jealous, Immortal Master. This person is staggeringly devoted to you.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Nonsense!!” He grunts before getting up. He still feels the heat of the poison in his heart, so he decides to take another cold bath and then goes to meditate. According to the bestiary, the poison can last up to seven days if it’s not cured with dual cultivation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Well, Liu Qingge will avoid everyone (especially Shen Qingqiu) for seven days.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<span>Eight days after Shen Yuan's mission, Liu Qingge returns to the bamboo house. And this time he knocks on the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You're improving, shidi,” Shen Jiu greets him with a smug smirk. “What is the pleasure?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge still needs more classes, since he reaches out to offer him a fan without elegance or manners. Although he tries to meet his eyes, he finally looks away when an intense blush covers his cheeks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“For you.” He splutters. “You lost the other fan because of me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh!” Shen Jiu picks it up delicately, as Liu Qingge's strength has almost split the fan in half. Like all the ones he has given to them, it is pretty. This one is light blue with drawings of pink petals. “Shidi has very good taste. Too bad he's still a brute.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge mutters something under his breath before turning his back on him and leaving so fast that he seems to be running away. </span>
<em>
<span>How strange</span>
</em>
<span>, Shen Jiu thinks before closing the door. Although before the distraction he and Shen Yuan were talking about possible plans to protect Luo Binghe's sect, he now can only think of Liu Qingge's strange attitude.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shidi has brought you a gift,” he says, throwing the fan at him. Truth be told, Shen Jiu would rather keep such a pretty fan, but he acknowledges that the gift is not for him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan accepts it with bright eyes and much joy. Shen Jiu watches him, still with suspicion in mind. He thinks back to Liu Qingge's attitude, so unexpected, almost docile, and embarrassed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did something else happen during the succubus mission?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mn?” Shen Yuan raises his head, confused. “What are you talking about?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Liu Qingge is acting strange. Almost as if...” The words catch in his throat and he winces. “Like he's infatuated with you. Or Shen Qingqiu.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan's eyes widened before breaking into laughter. No meanness or mockery, just as if he had been told the funniest joke in the world. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No way! Liu Qingge is the second most straight man in the world!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still wary, Shen Jiu sits in front of him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s </span>
<em>
<span>straight</span>
</em>
<span>?” He demands, annoyed as always Shen Yuan says a word that he doesn't know.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know, the normal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It won't be very normal if I don't know what you're talking about,” he growls.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan's smile becomes more mocking. He has opened the fan, but without hiding behind it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Men who like women. Like Luo Binghe, the most straight man in the universe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh.” A faint blush stains his cheeks. “Don’t be ridiculous. Perhaps that is normal among mortals, but in the cultivation world things are different.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now it is Shen Yuan's turn to open his mouth in surprise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Seriously?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah. There are many reasons to choose your cultivation partner, not just their gender. For example, many of Xian Shu Peak's disciples prefer women.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Shen Yuan is right. Liu Qingge will one day choose someone with potential comparable to his own, not the crippled cultivation of any Shen Qingqiu. After clearing up the misunderstanding, Shen Jiu forgets about it to focus on the plans he was discussing with Shen Yuan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, there is something inside his chest that doesn't know whether to be relieved or disappointed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Now that you mention it...” Shen Yuan mutters after a while in silence. “Madame Meiyin said something about my soulmate. But the description was very ambiguous and in the end, she didn’t finish her prophecy. She said it was confusing, as she could read two different lives on the palm of my hand.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I'm not surprised: you stole my body.“</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan bows his head at first, embarrassed, but then he smiles mischievously.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you want to know how your soulmate is?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu tenses. He once believed in those tales, but there is nothing like that. The people you love leave you without an explanation, they hate you when you destroy their life. Meanwhile, you may end up appreciating the people you used to hate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t say foolishness.” Shen Jiu sighs, wiping the bitterness out of his voice before forcing a smirk. “I just hope our soulmate is better than the cat.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge flees the bamboo house thinking of burning a book. The bestiary said that in seven days the poison would be gone! Why has he still got so nervous seeing Shen Qingqiu, as graceful as ever? Liu Qingge notices his heart racing and his cheeks flushed. It’s ridiculous and embarrassing, but as he leaves Qing Jing Peak, he can only think of Shen Qingqiu's different smiles. Before he couldn’t bear them, now he appreciates them. He prefers his grins to his frowns or rolling eyes. Liu Qingge likes that sincere, wide, and bright smile when Shen Qingqiu is in a good mood and enthusiastically talks to him about some monster. But he also appreciates that other smile, more sarcastic and sometimes mischievous.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Feeling that his nervousness doesn’t fade, Liu Qingge flies to Qian Cao Peak. Impatient, he looks for Mu Qingfang and practically extends his wrist in front of his nose even though the healer is who usually chases after him to check on his injuries.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m poisoned,” he announces.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mu Qingfang pales.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It has to be something very serious for Liu-shidi to voluntarily seek me out.” Despite his concerned tone, there is irony in his voice. “Mn… Your meridians are fine, shidi. When were you poisoned? What symptoms do you notice?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Eight days ago, succubus poison. Shen Qingqiu's bestiary says that without dual cultivation it takes a week for the poison to disappear.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And it has disappeared.” Mu Qingfang lets go of him to give him a friendly slap on his forearm. “But you have done well to consult with me. I hope you will do it again in the future. And if only that stubborn Shen-shixiong would do the same!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge listens to him paralyzed and confused. This is the first time the healer has made a mistake. He still notices the poison inside his heart. Neither his nervousness, the tachycardia, or blushing is normal. The last time the poisoning wasn’t so serious and yet it only disappeared when he defeated Shen Qingqiu in combat, knocking him to the ground. The memory of Shen Qingqiu, disheveled, his clothes open to show his collarbones, only aggravates his current symptoms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He needs another cold bath and meditation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Since his trusted doctor had failed him, in the following days Liu Qingge didn’t know who to talk to about his problem. He demanded missions from Yue Qingyuan away from the sect, but Shen Qingqiu pursued him in his dreams. Also the damn words of the succubus. Liu Qingge needs to ask someone for help, but there are only two poison experts in the sect: the healer, who has mistakenly considered him cured, and Shen Qingqiu, the reason for his symptoms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In the end, Liu Qingge decides to talk to Liu Mingyan. She is the person he trusts the most in the world and if she was able to infiltrate a brothel to find answers (although in the end, he asked her not to do so, deciding that he would wait for Shen Qingqiu to tell him the truth) maybe she can also sneak in the Qing Jing Peak Library.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Mingyan sighs after sipping her cup of tea.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You are not poisoned, Gege. Your symptoms were already there before you faced the succubi, but you have only noticed it now,” she patiently explains to him after hearing his problem. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So what is it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge hates problems that he cannot solve with a sword. Thanks to his powerful cultivation, he has survived a lot of poisonings and accidents. But now he is affected by something nameless that keeps him from sleeping and makes him behave like an idiot in front of Shen Qingqiu.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You are in love.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He opens his mouth intending to protest, but then…</span>
</p><p>
<span>He understands that his sister is right.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He has fallen in love with Shen Qingqiu.</span>

<p>
<span>It has been a long time since Liu Qingge went on a mission with Shen Qingqiu. Although they are not alone, since Mu Qingfang accompanies them to Jinlan City, now that he is aware of his feelings he is nervous and tense. His gaze is hanging on Shen Qingqiu, as graceful as ever, in the way his fingers caress the fan he gave him. When Shen Qingqiu turns to look at him, Liu Qingge turns his head away and pretends to ask the healer if he needs him to carry something.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yue Qingyuan comes out to greet them, although it’s no secret that he does so because he has always had a slight soft spot for Shen Qingqiu. Liu Qingge turns his back on the two of them, slightly flustered and uneasy inside his chest. It is impossible to be the only one who has noticed how beautiful and intelligent Shen Qingqiu is, the smiles that he hides behind his growls, and how honest he is despite the rumors. Restless, Liu Qingge looks at his two martial brothers out of the corner of his eye and not understanding why he has such absurd thoughts. Although there has always been something anomalous in the relationship between Yue Qingyuan and Shen Qingqiu, it’s not romantic.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yue Qingyuan has already given everyone a few last pieces of advice (and stared at Liu Qingge to ask him to please not be reckless) when Shang Qinghua appears running, hair tousled by the air and pupils dilated.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shen-shixiong!” He screams but falls silent when he finds that four Peak Lords are staring at him very intently, with curiosity and a bit of bewilderment. Shang Qinghua begins to babble unintelligible words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge is not the only one confused. Shen Qingqiu looks puzzled, and although Yue Qingyuan smiles, he has slightly frowned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is something wrong, shidi?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have to talk with Shen-shixiong. It’s a personal matter. Nothing important.” He clarifies, but so vehemently that Liu Qingge suspects it's not true. Intrigued, he looks at Shen Qingqiu, who doesn't seem to understand what Shang Qinghua is referring to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If it is not important, we can discuss it when I return from the mission.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He's probably in Jinlan City! The </span>
<em>
<span>matter </span>
</em>
<span>we talked about the other day!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu frowns and Shang Qinghua bows slightly before disappearing again running. Liu Qingge has always considered him to be a strange cultivator, very different from the rest of the immortal masters, but his attitude today is especially unexpected. Intrigued, he finally dares to stand beside Shen Qingqiu.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What is he referring to?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Honestly, Liu-shidi, I don’t know.” Shen Qingqiu sighs, his fan (the fan he gave him) brushing his lips. “We have been talking about some renovations to my house for a long time. It's probably nothing important, shall we?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge nods and tries to forget all those indecent thoughts to focus on the mission. The afternoon before he had been having tea with Liu Mingyan and his sister had offered him a lot of useless advice. This is not a date or a pleasure trip, but rather solving the mystery of a plague that has already killed too many people. But Liu Mingyan had poisoned his head with excuses to spend more time together with Shen Qingqiu. "Don't be separated from him," she had whispered to him. "Maybe you have the opportunity to protect him and carry him in your arms. And you must find an inn where there is only one room. That never fails."</span>
</p><p>
<span>After taking a deep breath, Liu Qingge forgets the echo of his sister's voice and returns to the present, willing to impress Shen Qingqiu and save lives at the same time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In reality, Liu Qingge doesn't understand why they chose him. It is a plague, they need a doctor like Mu Qingfang and a scholar like Shen Qingqiu. Liu Qingge is not subtle and he cannot end a disease with his sword. But he doesn't regret it either. He likes to listen to Shen Qingqiu's theories, walk beside him, help him enter the city, capturing those casual touches like his hands brushing against each other.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jinlan City is a large city but covered in a patina of decadence and desolation. But even at that moment, Shen Qingqiu shines and even dares to joke when they meet Yang Yixuan, a brat who tries (unsuccessfully) to keep them out. Yang Yixuan has no qualms about telling them everything he knows or guiding them to his house, where there is a sick monk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Liu-shidi should welcome him as a disciple.” Shen Qingqiu teases him, using his fan to hit him on the cheek until Liu Qingge snorts. “He fits the profile of Bai Zhan Peak. He is brave, feisty, and full of energy. He will be terrifying with a sword!” Shen Qingqiu pauses, contemplative. “You know? The boy has potential. You should keep him before someone tries to kidnap him.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t say nonsense, Shen Qingqiu.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There is something wrong with the city, something that stains the air, freezes the atmosphere, and turns off all voices. It is something invisible and that makes it more terrifying. Liu Qingge stands the whole time with his hand on Cheng Luan's hilt, ready to face those enemies that he senses but doesn’t see.</span>
</p><p>
<span>While Mu Qingfang stays at the Finely-Crafted Weapons shop to develop a cure, the two of them go out to investigate the city. Liu Qingge doesn’t want to part, but they must. Before leaving each in one direction, he holds Shen Qingqiu's hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Be careful,” he asks him. “If you have problems, call me like last time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And this time, he won’t be late. It is a promise.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan knew there was something wrong with the city and discovered it too late when the sower infected his hand. However, his satisfaction in solving the mystery disappears when he meets Gongyi Xiao, who is no longer Huan Hua's head disciple.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then Luo Binghe appears.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The System awakens from its slumber, filling his head with updates and beeps, shrill noises that almost silence the "Shizun" that Luo Binghe purrs with a satisfied smile. It is a predatory smirk, an echo of the innocence of his white lotus that has darkened hopelessly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan stretches his fan to hide his nervousness, the fear that he doesn’t want to reflect on his face, and the stupefaction. That's wrong. The presence of Luo Binghe, two years before what the novel said, is as bad as this plot that shouldn’t exist. Much to their regret, they have literally followed the book. Why have their decisions triggered events that shouldn't exist?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Perhaps Shen Yuan should have imagined that training Luo Binghe and preparing him to survive the Abyss would mean that he had the tools to return sooner.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Shen Jiu is going to kill me, </span>
</em>
<span>he thinks. </span>
<em>
<span>If Luo Binghe doesn't dismember me first. Of course.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan remains silent, crouching behind his cold and perfect facade, as Luo Binghe orders the Huan Hua Palace disciples around. He notices that the other disciples blindly follow Luo Binghe and the hateful looks they give to Shen Yuan. It's worse than Luo Binghe's contempt, as they don't bother to fake their dislike for him. The only one who doesn't do it is Gongyi Xiao, also the only one who also keeps his distance from Luo Binghe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>If it weren't for Shen Qingqiu's inevitable fall from grace, perhaps Shen Yuan would accept Shen Jiu's proposal and take Gongyi Xiao away from the viper's nest that is Huan Hua Palace.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe offers to take the sower’s corpse to the Finely-Crafted Weapons shop and Shen Yuan has no choice but to accept despite the fear in his gut. But Luo Binghe can't attack him. He won't. Liu Qingge is nearby and there are too many witnesses. Luo Binghe is not so naive to reveal his true nature so soon. Right now, violence and darkness hide behind an almost kind smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>However, Shen Yuan is terrified.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Master and disciple walk silently through the abandoned streets of Jinlan City. Shen Yuan goes ahead to guide Luo Binghe, although what he wants is to flee, return to the bamboo house and warn Shen Jiu that all his plans have been rushed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“After these years shizun is not going to say anything to this disciple?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe's voice sounds sad and turns into a chill under Shen Yuan's skin. He squeezes the handle of the fan without daring to turn around. He doesn't know what to say. It's too late to be the kind shizun of the past.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We must hurry,” he comments, trying to stay calm. “Mu-shidi needs that corpse to develop the cure. We can talk later.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That is a desperate promise, a lie since Shen Yuan only thinks of hiding behind Liu Qingge's shadow until they return to the sect.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Obviously, Luo Binghe is not fooled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan keeps walking when he hears a thud. Turning around, he discovers that Luo Binghe has thrown the sower’s corpse on the ground and stares at him with an intensity that freezes his legs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know the truth, right?” Luo Binghe asks him. And the sadness in his eyes seems a little more real and less feigned until it turns to rage. “The other shizun told you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan's eyes widen and he feels his lungs gasp for air. There is a question in his throat that he can't pronounce. Paralyzed and confused, he watches as Luo Binghe approaches him with determined steps. Unconsciously, he backs away until his back hits the wall.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you talking about?” He finally splutters.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe has stopped in front of him. Now he is taller and wider, more powerful and Shen Yuan feels tiny and insignificant compared to his shadow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This disciple always knew that he had two shizuns. A kinder one.” Luo Binghe reaches out to hold his chin and prevent Shen Yuan from shunning his gaze. He is smiling like he did in the past and it doesn't seem like a lie. “And a colder one.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His grin turns into a furious scowl.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Shen Yuan listens to him with his heart almost in his throat and both hands gripping the fan. He suddenly remembers that Luo Binghe always cooked disproportionate amounts of food, ideal for two people. That Luo Binghe took on the role of a guard dog, and if it weren't for the fact that he always yelled at the visitors, Liu Qingge would have discovered them long ago.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe knows. Luo Binghe has always known.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What did the other shizun tell you about the Alliance Conference?” His voice is dangerous, it hides anger and pain. “Out of shizun’s fear, this disciple assumes that he already knows his true identity. But does he know what the other shizun did?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan listens to him, still stunned by the revelation. And another truth hits him until all his plans are broken. Looking up, he understands that Luo Binghe is sad and frustrated, but his hatred is not towards him. Luo Binghe doesn't hate him. He is the </span>
<em>
<span>kind shizun</span>
</em>
<span>. Everything he did has been worth it, and Shen Yuan has avoided that cruel future.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He can live. Luo Binghe doesn’t dream of ripping off his limbs and torturing him to madness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But only him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe is furious at Shen Jiu. Shen Yuan can understand it, but he refuses to let the story end as PIDW.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He told me. Everything,” he adds before Luo Binghe accuses Shen Jiu of misrepresenting the truth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The demon stiffens and his eyes glow a little redder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did he tell you that he tried to stab me in the heart? How did he push me to hell despite my pleas?” His breathing sounds quick and demonic qi begins to surround him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan doesn't dare to answer because he knows it. That has always been the problem: he has always known too much.</span>
<em>
<span> Actually, it's my fault,</span>
</em>
<span> he thinks. </span>
<em>
<span>Shen Jiu pushed you because I would die if he didn't.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Guilt is like a flower that grows in his lungs and spreads down his windpipe. He feels the bitter taste of regrets with every inspiration.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m here thanks to shizun’s kindness.” Luo Binghe continues to speak, his hand releasing Shen Yuan's chin to caress his cheek. “Shizun's qiankun pouch saved this disciple in the Abyss. This disciple also remembered all his lessons. So shizun shouldn't be afraid of my demon nature. Because this disciple will do his best to always protect shizun.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That's wrong. All his words are wrong. Shen Yuan gave Luo Binghe the qiankun pouch, but they prepared it between the two of them. Shen Yuan prepared the funniest lessons about monsters, but it was Shen Jiu who tried to teach Luo Binghe music, painting, and calligraphy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu pushed Luo Binghe into the Abyss, but Shen Yuan's hand is also behind that decision.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He is not perfect. He is not the good master and Shen Jiu is not just bad. But Luo Binghe has built a wrong image of both of them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What about Shen Jiu?” He interrogates him and his former disciple's expression darkens, refusing to answer. And his silence is worse than acknowledging all the bloody wishes that Luo Binghe hides in his heart. “Listen to me, Luo Binghe. What happened at the Alliance Conference was a misunderstanding.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is that what the other one told you? A misunderstanding?” Luo Binghe flashes a crooked and sarcastic smile. “Did he tell you that the legendary sword Xiu Ya aimed at the wrong demon?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s hard to explain!” Shen Yuan wants to scream in frustration. “But he had his reasons.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe sighs. And his anger disappears, devoured by disappointment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course, shizun would rather believe the other shizun and his lies than this disciple.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s not true! I believe in you, Luo Binghe.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>But I also know that your mind is now affected by Xin Mo.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe stares at him for a few seconds before moving even closer, until Shen Yuan is trapped between him and the wall. Overwhelmed at feeling him so close, his chest almost crushing him, Shen Yuan averts his gaze and Luo Binghe grabs his face again. His thumb stops on his lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Prove it.” Luo Binghe says. “If shizun drinks my blood, I will trust him too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan feels his heart stop. It is a trap. It has to be. Demon blood is almost poison, a form of torture. It is surrendering to Luo Binghe's will. And he knows it. It’s not an innocent request. It takes a lot of confidence to accept the blood of a powerful demon. Shen Yuan cannot accept it. What if it's a trap? What if he really hates both of them?</span>
</p><p>
<span>He can't, but he needs to. He needs to trust Luo Binghe and show him that he can trust him too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine,” he nods with a dry throat and fear spreading throughout his body.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Luo Binghe finally flashes his first authentic smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When the demon pulls away, Shen Yuan feels that he can finally breathe again. Although his pulse is still racing when Luo Binghe uses a knife to cut his wrist and offers it to him. With nervous fingers, stiff with anguish, Shen Yuan grabs Luo Binghe's wrist. His movements are slow, delaying an inevitable decision. But inside him there is something that still doubts and mistrusts, there is a voice that screams that he should flee away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan closes his eyes before accepting Luo Binghe's blood.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It is unpleasant and sticky. If he could, Shen Yuan would kill the author for having such disturbing ideas. Unfortunately, Airplane is not in that world and he cannot suffer the consequences of all his horrible kinks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan tries to regain his dignity when he raises his head and uses a handkerchief to wipe his lips. Suspicious, he watches over Luo Binghe, who is healing the wound thanks to his abilities. He seems happy, maybe too much. But he never uses his new control to hurt him. On the contrary, Luo Binghe takes Shen Yuan's hand and strokes the sower's wound until it is erased.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks,” he mutters, his fingers still clinging to his hand. “Shizun's trust means a lot to me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan nods, still guilty.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe is wrong, but despite that supposed confidence, he doesn't want to believe him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This teacher can justify what the other shizun did.” He looks into Luo Binghe's eyes. “Now it's your turn to trust me. Please. When we finish the Jinlan City mission, listen to this teacher's explanation.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And perhaps with more time Shen Yuan can organize his ideas to avoid a disaster.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe purses his lips with disgust but agrees. Since they don’t have any more unfinished business, the demon picks up the sower’s corpse and Shen Yuan guides him back to the Finely-Crafted Weapons shop. Although they walk together, their shoulders almost brushing, there is an even greater distance between them than before.</span>
</p><p>
<span>An abyss for all that Shen Yuan knows and doesn’t dare to say.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge is in front of the store when they return. He frowns upon discovering that Shen Yuan is not alone, although, from his expression, it takes him a while to recognize Luo Binghe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is he...”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mn. It seems that my disciple survived the Alliance Conference.“ Shen Yuan waves his fan a little nervous, he has forgotten to ask Luo Binghe what his intentions are with the Huan Hua Palace.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before, he believed Luo Binghe wanted to conquer it, but perhaps he is wrong. And Shen Yuan has decided to trust Luo Binghe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Liu-shishu,” Luo Binghe bows, although there is a certain impertinence in his voice, in the way he looks at his martial uncle. He smiles again. His smirk is arrogant and mischievous, a bit malicious. “This humble must go. Someone must hunt down those sowers.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge stiffens, ready for action, upon discovering the corpse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Demons?” He guesses. “I will hunt them too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This humble will be delighted to collaborate with the War God.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan wants to hit his wayward disciple with the fan. Liu Qingge is too distracted thinking about hunting and hasn’t realized it, but he has noticed the mockery hidden in Luo Binghe's words. He is challenging him. He is hinting that he is the only one who can hunt sowers. Shen Yuan sighs while shaking his head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This teacher will help Mu Qingfang. Don't act like mindless brutes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>When he turns around, the two of them are glaring at each other. An aura of competitiveness grows, a tension that is broken when they run off in opposite directions. Shen Yuan doesn’t care.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He is tired, stunned by so many emotions, worried about what will happen. And guilty. Guilt doesn't fade even when he says goodbye to Mu Qingfang and goes to rest. Perhaps he should speak to Shen Jiu before Luo Binghe. He still has the fake jade guanyin in his inventory. If Shen Jiu gives it to Luo Binghe, perhaps his anger will soften.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With those ideas in mind, Shen Yuan closes his eyes and tries to rest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The next day begins better than he imagined after the return of the protagonist, although Shen Yuan hides a concern that devours him inside. He remains taciturn as Mu Qingfang explains that he has developed an antidote and when Luo Binghe returns to announce that he has hunted more sowers than Liu Qingge. The War God seems wounded in his pride and remains upset all morning. It’s tempting to tease him, but Shen Yuan can't find the right moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He only thinks of returning to the Cang Qiong Mountain Sect.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan stands aside as the city regains its vitality and the other sects return. He greets his other martial brothers, not understanding why Shang Qinghua is still so nervous or why Liu Qingge is startled every time Luo Binghe approaches. In other circumstances, he would laugh to see that his arrogant shidi has tasted his first defeat, but none of that matters.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He also ignores the hatred from the Huan Hua Palace's gazes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Shen Yuan has no choice but to return to reality when the situation spirals out of control. The sowers accuse him of a ridiculous crime. Qiu Haitang emerges to reveal Shen Qingqiu's past. The Huan Hua Palace announces that he mistreated Luo Binghe, who remains silent.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It's too soon. Nothing is happening as it should and Shen Yuan freezes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But some changes are positive. His sect defends him. Liu Qingge stands in front of Shen Yuan to duel for him, Yue Qingyuan announces that they are infamies and Cang Qiong Sect will never deliver Shen Qingqiu. Even Qi Qingqi or Shang Qinghua are supporting him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s nice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But the most intriguing thing is Luo Binghe's silence. While the others argue, Shen Yuan watches over him hiding behind his fan. Luo Binghe's silence is unexpected. And suspicious. He is obviously uncomfortable and Shen Yuan now knows that it is because he doesn’t want to accuse him unfairly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But he doesn’t defend him either.</span>
</p><p>
<span>These accusations are frustrating for the absence of solid evidence. Right now, if Shen Yuan refused, he could avoid the trial plot. In the book, the hatred of the protagonist was the real reason behind Shen Qingqiu’s imprisonment. And now Luo Binghe remains silent while uncertainty grows within Shen Yuan's chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And he finally understands him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe is divided. He doesn’t want to imprison Shen Yuan, the nice shizun, but Shen Jiu. Luo Binghe doesn't say anything because he wants Shen Yuan to return to the Cang Qiong Sect. But the accusations won't disappear. Perhaps they will return with evidence for the next time to lock up Shen Jiu, his real target.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Shen Jiu is guilty of almost all of those crimes. But Shen Yuan doesn't care, since he promised that he would protect the scum villain from the protagonist's wrath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s ridiculous!” He finally grunted before handing Xiu Ya to Liu Qingge. Shen Jiu will kill him if the Huan Hua Palace puts its stinky hands on his sword. “Enough. These demons plan to divide us and cause a conflict with their downfall. This master won’t allow it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan takes a step forward, but Liu Qingge grabs his wrist instead of his sword.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you doing, Shen Qingqiu?” He hisses. “You stay with us.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan makes an immense effort to not agree and return to his side. Liu Qingge is too proud to admit it, but there is a plea in his eyes and it is so obvious that it hurts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This master rejects all accusations,” Shen Yuan announces, turning his back on his sect to face the Old Palace Master. “To show my goodwill, I agree to be locked up, but only on the following conditions: if during an agreed time you don‘t find solid evidence, there will be no trial and I will be released. If that evidence appears, I agree to remain locked up for as long as it’s necessary until the trial.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan has never liked the character of the Old Palace Master, but now he finds him obnoxious and disgusting. His smile is cruel and false, his eyes shine with greed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“These are very serious accusations, Master Shen.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Anyone can make up the worst charges. That they are horrible doesn’t mean that they are true.” Shen Yuan points his free hand at the sowers. “They are murderers, demons that feed on human beings. Are you suggesting that their testimony is more valuable than mine? I want proof. They have accused me like they could accuse Mu Qingfang or anyone else.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But the hand!” A disciple of the Huan Hua Palace protests, one of those who looked at him yesterday with hatred.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It is cured and this master will explain the reasons behind the cure at the appropriate time.” Shen Yuan is not stupid and for his strategy to work he needs Luo Binghe on his side. Then he points his hand at Qiu Haitang. “I'm sorry, but I don't know you miss. It is the first time that we have met and I can assure you that I don't know the Qiu family.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan feels a little bad when she clenches her fists and teeth in frustration. In the book, he found it very satisfying that Qiu Haitang achieved her justice, but his life is no longer a book.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you don’t accept my conditions, this master will not accept this humiliation.” Shen Yuan stares at the Old Palace Master, challenging him with his gaze. “I think charging an innocent person without fair, verifiable evidence can be a very dangerous precedent. Do we have a deal or not?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The Old Palace Master has erased his smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“10 days,” he announces.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Too much,” Liu Qingge growls, still holding onto Shen Yuan's wrist tightly. “5 days.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A week,” Shen Yuan intervenes. “Or nothing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan knows that everyone is unhappy, but they cannot complain. They will not be locked up in the infamous Water Prison! After sighting resignedly, Shen Yuan turns to look at Liu Qingge one last time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t worry, Liu-shidi,” he promises him. “Everything will end well.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge has pursed his lips and is not looking at him, but at the Huan Hua Palace with fury. If they were a huge monster, he would have already defeated them. Reluctantly, Liu Qingge releases Shen Yuan's wrist, but then hugs him tightly, refusing to let go.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan feels like his heart is a bit broken when he finally separates from his sect to walk to Huan Hua Palace. Gongyi Xiao approaches with an immortal binding cable and an apologetic look.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry, master Shen,” he says before tying Shen Yuan's wrists and then his arms behind his back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Feeling his qi disappear is terrifying. Suddenly, Shen Yuan begins to doubt whether that was a good idea. He regrets it, but it's too late to back down. He tries to hold his head high and pretend that nothing is affecting him. Before leaving together with Huan Hua Palace, he takes one last look at his sect. They are furious. Yue Qingyuan seems to be preventing Liu Qingge from drawing his sword and destroying the nearest buildings, Qi Qingqi mutters insults and Mu Qingfang tries to calm her down. Shang Qinghua is pale and wrings his hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They are also his new family.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan turns his back on them one last time. As he walks, Luo Binghe soon stands beside him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t worry, shizun,” he promises him with a whisper. “I’ll stay with you. I'll talk to the Old Palace Master to untie you. He likes me, he will listen to me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they have to fly to Huan Hua Palace, Luo Binghe is the one who offers to take him in his sword. Although his presence calms him down and makes him feel a bit protected, Shen Yuan's uneasiness is growing increasingly. It seems like he won't be able to run away from his conversation with Luo Binghe.</span>

<p>
<span>Shen Jiu appreciates tranquility and silence. For him, staying in the bamboo house is a vacation where he can read or play music. However, Shen Jiu is not used to resting. And there comes a moment when his thoughts fly to his problems: the information that Shang Qinghua has given him about Luo Binghe's advancement, what Shen Yuan has told him about the future, and the mission in Jinlan City.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a sigh, he gets up to go to his table. While Shen Yuan and the others went to the city, he thought about the clues that he knew to solve the riddle. It has been an interesting exercise and Shen Jiu is almost convinced that the culprits are sowers. When Shen Yuan returns, he will ask the answer, although he is confident of his victory.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Shen Yuan returns…</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu feels a chill, an echo of his worst nightmares trapped in his heart. Suddenly, a cold rise from his chest. Shen Jiu notices frost on his bones and snow sliding down his ribs. It's the fear that Shen Yuan won't come back like Qi-Ge didn't. </span>
<em>
<span>Nonsense!</span>
</em>
<span> He thinks, furious. But although Shen Jiu tries to ignore those absurd thoughts, he still has badly healed wounds and others that are still open and throbbing under his skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But the cold doesn’t disappear either when Shen Jiu sits under the sun that comes through the window or when the cat approaches him to demand pampering after a whole day of ignoring each other.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I hope Shen Yuan comes back soon</span>
</em>
<span>, he thinks as he absentmindedly strokes the cat's head.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>The Water Prison is damp and bleak. He only hears the sound of waterfalls and a slow, distant bubbling, like acid. Shen Yuan is left in a cell with no other company than the exhaustion of him and the tug of the ropes as they dig into his flesh. With a sigh, he sits up. Although a part of him wants to hold on to the tiny hope that Luo Binghe will help him, he needs to focus to solve that problem.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Who is behind the sowers?</span>
</em>
<span> Shen Yuan frowns. He should have suspected something since that plot didn't appear in the original book. Nor is it an irrelevant subplot like the skinner's case. Is it the world pushing Shen Qingqiu to his original destiny? Or something else? </span>
<em>
<span>Someone is trying to blame me. If it's not Luo Binghe, then who? </span>
</em>
<span>The only clue he has is his knowledge of PIDW.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The sowers' plot must be a consequence of the changes he and Shen Jiu have caused, but Shen Yuan can't think of any. Although those changes exist. Like Luo Binghe developing different feelings for his shizuns since he always knew there were two of them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That implies that there are several more changes Shen Yuan wasn’t aware of.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Perhaps he could ask Luo Binghe for help in solving the mystery of the sowers. He's still a Demon Lord, right? Although it’s too early and his power is not as consolidated as two years from now. Shen Yuan is almost convinced that the culprit of the sowers is a demon. Unless he was a human disguised as Shen Qingqiu.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although refuting the sowers will be easy as surely they will not find any proof since Shen Yuan has not done anything, he needs them to investigate who is pulling the strings and what they want.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The next problem is Qiu Haitang. Shen Yuan bites his lip as he remembers all the truth serums in PIDW. He needs one of those. Please! Is the answer to all his problems! No one will be able to complain about what he says if it is thanks to a truth serum. Shen Yuan has never seen Qiu Haitang before, nor is he behind the sowers nor has he mistreated his disciple. Although it is a choice too risky because of the secrets he hides: Luo Binghe's demonic nature, that he is not the real Shen Qingqiu…</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan considers that it has been an eternity since he was abandoned in the dark when the water parted and a woman dressed in gold with a whip in hand entered. He tenses, as he recognizes one of Luo Binghe's wives. </span>
<em>
<span>What's going on? </span>
</em>
<span>He thinks. The woman looks at him with the same contempt for a cockroach.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You're not so cocky anymore, eh Shen Qingqiu?” She says in a voice worthy of a movie villain. But not the main baddie, but one of those secondary villains that give more pity than fear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>However, Shen Yuan is unarmed and tired, lacking spiritual powers, and stiffens when she approaches him. </span>
<em>
<span>The Little Palace Mistress?</span>
</em>
<span> He remembers those luxurious clothes and the symbol of the Huan Hua Palace on a tassel around her waist. And for the whip. That wife became famous in the harem for being one of the most aggressive.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don't say anything today, Shen Qingqiu?” She shakes the whip, menacing. “Have you lost your arrogance, you infamous scum? You weren't so polite when you mocked our Huan Hua Palace disciples during the Alliance Conference.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>SHEN JIU!!!!!!????? </span>
</em>
<span>Shen Yuan wants to cry. </span>
<em>
<span>Why are you like this?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The whip hiss before hitting him on the shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don't ignore me, Shen Qingqiu!” The woman screams. The whip moves in time with her words hitting Shen Yuan on the shoulders or chest. “You are the worst scum! How dare you mistreat our dear Luo Binghe? You don't deserve his kindness!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although her blows are not very intense, without his spiritual powers they hurt and cause him to clench his teeth to contain the pain and not scream. Shen Yuan closes his eyes and turns his head away, unable to do anything.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The next blow doesn’t arrive.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When he opens his eyes, Shen Yuan discovers that a hand has stopped the Little Palace Mistress's wrist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Binghe!" She yells.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Luo Binghe?" He mutters.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They are both just as confused.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe is furious and is surrounded by an aura of menace and darkness. Without finesse, he plucks the whip from the Little Palace Mistress and throws it into the acid.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What are you doing?" He demands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Justice! He is a terrible scum who hurt you!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He is my shizun.” Although he doesn't scream, his voice is deep and dark, almost a roar. “Leave.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman has paled, although pride prevents her from lowering her head and admitting her mistake. Furious, she clenches her fists and turns to walk away from the prison with impatient strides.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan takes a deep breath, but the atmosphere remains tense and pernicious. Although he wants to thank Luo Binghe, something inside him trembles as he realizes that his disciple has disappeared and a very dangerous demon lurks inside his skin. Shen Yuan stiffens when Luo Binghe kneels in front of him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is shizun hurt?”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Just sore, tired, and very upset.</span>
</em>
<span> Shen Yuan shakes his head instead of replying.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe has frowned and gazes furiously at the whip-torn clothing and reddened skin. He has the expression of someone capable of murder and Shen Yuan swallows, uncomfortable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s nothing.” He manages to sputter. </span>
</p><p>
<span>His words don't calm Luo Binghe. His former disciple pulls out a knife and begins to cut the immortal binding cables. Shen Yuan lets out a surprised groan as he feels his qi circulate again. He is so tired that he even allows Luo Binghe to take his wrist and pass spiritual energy to him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This disciple promised that he would protect shizun. I am sorry for not having kept my word.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s okay, Luo Binghe.” Shen Yuan closes his eyes. “She had her reasons for being mad at me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was the other shizun who offended Huan Hua Palace.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>And pushed me into the Abyss, </span>
</em>
<span>Luo Binghe's eyes seem to say.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Even though the heat has returned to his limbs, Shen Yuan feels that it is even colder than before. He wants to defend Shen Jiu, but he neither understands why he did it nor does he know exactly what happened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And he doesn't dare to tell Luo Binghe the truth. Where does he start? Because they are the characters in a book? That it was his destiny to suffer for the enjoyment of readers like him?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan bows his head and silently waits for Luo Binghe to finish.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How is the investigation?” He asks when Luo Binghe pulls his hand away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Someone burned the sowers by mistake and they are arguing because they don't know how to confirm if their words were true or not. Qiu Haitang has submitted some records of his family.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you know what Cang Qiong Mountain Sect is doing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe shakes his head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Has anyone asked to visit me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although it’s not a surprise, the answer hurts him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh.” Sad, Shen Yuan bows his head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Luo Binghe's hand holds his cheek and encourages him to look up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s okay, shizun.” His grin is the only thing beautiful inside the Water Prison and at the same time, there is something twisted about it. “This disciple will always be by your side.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks, Luo Binghe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But he doesn't have the energy to smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I'm going to talk to the Old Palace Master,” Luo Binghe announces as he collects the fragments of the immortal binding cable. “I will not allow anyone else to disturb shizun. And shizun deserves a better place than this cell.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But as the rope is removed, Shen Yuan's clothing slides off and several pieces of cloth also fall to the ground, revealing the pale skin on his arms, shoulders, and chest. Shen Yuan snorts, too tired to bother, not realizing that Luo Binghe has frozen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A rustle of cloth is heard and then Luo Binghe's outer robes end up on top of Shen Yuan just like a blanket.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Binghe?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But the demon has turned and is gone, leaving him alone, but less cold.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan covers himself with the outer robes and sighs. Although they haven't talked about Shen Jiu, he doesn't feel any relief. That pending conversation still hangs in the air. Someday it will explode and Shen Yuan trembles because he doesn’t know what he will say. Meanwhile, the remorse of knowing that he is neither perfect nor deserving to be idealized continues to grow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He is as guilty as Shen Jiu of pushing Luo Binghe into the Abyss.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I'll tell him next time.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>But the next time comes too soon. Only a few hours, maybe half a day, Luo Binghe returns with a tray of food. The smell betrays that it has been cooked by him. Although Shen Yuan missed the protagonist's legendary food, regrets are a cyst in his stomach that robs his appetite.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, he smiles and tries to eat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He doesn't want to think about the reason behind his silence, but Shen Yuan is aware that despite all his promises, he is still afraid of Luo Binghe. A three-year fear cannot fade in a few days. He has had so many nightmares, so much stress, that he is terrified to stop being the </span>
<em>
<span>kind shizun</span>
</em>
<span> and that is why he eats even though he is not hungry and smiles at him even though he is tired and sleepy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because he doesn't want to upset Luo Binghe and stay alone in the Water Prison.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Or end up shattered like the original Shen Qingqiu.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe tells him about the monsters of the Abyss and how he managed to defeat them by following his advice. He is proud and happy, but Shen Yuan is unable to pay attention to him even though he wants to ask him more about his stories. He keeps thinking about those topics that both of them are intentionally avoiding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Luo Binghe," he says when his former disciple pauses. "How are the investigations going?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe blinks, surprised by the change of subject. But right away he smiles.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Very well. Shizun doesn’t need to worry about anything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ironically, Shen Yuan is concerned about his smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan knows his disciple. He knew his disciple. But this Luo Binghe is different. He talks a lot and, but at the same time, he doesn't say anything. Shen Yuan is trapped in a dark corner far from the world without knowing if his charges hold, what his enemies are planning, what his allies will do.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And he wants to trust Luo Binghe, who protects him, who brings him self-cooked food and distracts him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But he doesn’t know if he can trust the stranger that still doesn’t recognize what he plans to do with Shen Jiu nor if he has already denied the abuse accusation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But when Shen Yuan is once again left alone with Luo Binghe's outer robes for cover, with no hand ties and a full stomach, those doubts dissipate a bit.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Maybe I could give Shen Jiu the fake guanyin jade? </span>
</em>
<span>He thinks. Shen Yuan has kept that ace for years and Luo Binghe can't know which shizun protected him since he acted from the shadows.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The next time Luo Binghe returns, he brings more food and stories, but no information about the outside world.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan eats in silence, torn between the satisfaction of knowing that his advice was useful to Luo Binghe and worried about everything the demon is silent about. What if Qiu Haitang has provided solid evidence? What if the Huan Hua Palace is forcing the other sects to celebrate the trial?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although Luo Binghe doesn't tell him what he needs to hear, he keeps him company and Shen Yuan is grateful. Solitude is sticky and cold.</span>
<em>
<span> How will Shen Jiu be?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Temperatures drop suddenly and Shen Yuan trembles when an ice demon enters the cell. It is the first time that he sees Mobei-jun and opens his mouth in surprise. He is even more awesome than most fanarts! But what is truly impressive is that that six-foot demon kneels helpfully before Luo Binghe, who looks at him almost indifferently.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jushang,” Mobei-jun says with a monotone voice, “the army is ready.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan's eyes widen as those words dig into his stomach. Still, he tries to smile. Because he wants to believe in Luo Binghe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you having trouble at the Demon Realm, Binghe?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not this time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His answer leaves him more uncomfortable and scary, almost breathless. Luo Binghe sits up calmly, once again not being sincere but not lying either. When he turns once to look at him, his smile is dark and dangerous, showing his fangs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don't worry, shizun. You'll be out of here soon."</span>

<p>
<span>Alone, the silence grows until it drowns him. Shen Yuan is already tired of repeating his thoughts, of rehearsing apologies that he won’t dare to say to Luo Binghe. And he is afraid of what happens outside Water Prison, of the reality that is hidden in Luo Binghe's smiles.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan sighs and rests his head on his knees. Although thanks to his cultivation level he doesn't need it, he would like to sleep. Maybe that way the time would pass faster. He could close his eyes and the days will fade. He doesn't even know how long he's been locked in that dark hole.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At first, when he hears noises, he thinks it is a hallucination. But the noise grows into footsteps that even waterfalls can't muffle. Shen Yuan sits up, tense and worried. They don't sound like Luo Binghe's. He recognizes more than one person. Shen Yuan trembles at the memory of the Little Palace Mistress. He hopes it's not her. Fortunately, this time he is not helpless.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just tired, bored, and uneasy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The acid waterfall part and Shen Yuan recognizes the golden uniform of Huan Hua Palace's disciples. And a face identical to his.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But furious.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shen Jiu?” He babbles, taking a step back. “What are you doing here?”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Luo Binghe hasn't captured him either, right? </span>
</em>
<span>A fear sharp as thorns spreads up Shen Yuan's spine. He is frozen when Shen Jiu enters the cell and walks towards him impatiently and angrily, his eyes narrowed and his mouth twisted into a terrifying grin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan reflexively closes his eyes, terrified that he will yell at him or try to hit him. However, a hand brushes Luo Binghe's clothes away showing the torn fabric.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who did this to you?” He hisses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Confused, Shen Yuan blinks and looks him into his eyes. Shen Jiu's fury is not directed at him, he understands, but at someone else. To the person who has dared to harm him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m fine! It’s nothing…!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Shen Jiu has grabbed his arm and drags him out of the cell. Stunned by confusion, Shen Yuan is slow to recognize that the disciple accompanying him is Gongyi Xiao and that Shen Jiu carries Xiu Ya tied around his waist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He comes with me,” Shen Jiu warns the disciple with that tone of voice that admits no retorts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gongyi Xiao is pale and looks at Shen Yuan with horror. The boy bows his head, not opposing Shen Jiu's decision but supporting him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Shen Yuan still doesn't understand what is happening and no one explains anything to him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu drags him through the maze, guided by Gongyi Xiao. As they move away from the Water Prison, Shen Jiu's grip softens. Looking at his face, Shen Yuan sees a murderous fury in his eyes. And that the hand that holds his arm trembles, but doesn’t waver when passing spiritual energy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Thanks," he mutters.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu responds with a grunt through his teeth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Leaving the subways of the Huan Hua Palace, they arrive at a courtyard lavishly decorated with gold and white jade. Shen Yuan swallows hard, as there is a crowd arguing loudly. He recognizes the golden robes of the Huan Hua Palace, but also the family uniforms of his sect. The voices gradually fall silent when they recognize them. Shen Yuan flinches, nervous and scared at so many confused and incredulous looks, judging them, wondering who they really are.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shen… Qingqiu?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They are two.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who is the real one?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A figure dressed in white pushes his way through the crowd and runs towards them. It is the first time that Shen Yuan has seen Liu Qingge so pale, with a gleam of fear in his eyes, but his steps are determined and he immediately catches up with them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t fail this time protecting him, you useless shidi,” Shen Jiu growls, releasing Shen Yuan. And Liu Qingge nods with a determined expression as he remains dazzled by the sunlight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu rips off the outer black clothes and leaves him with Liu Qingge's protection to face the crowd. His anger is evident, also his hate, but his voice is cold as a glass snake when he speaks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who has dared to harm him?” And he throws the clothes on the floor with contempt. “I demand an explanation, Old Palace Master.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The man, famous for his weasel smiles, is just as confused as the rest. Even so, he does not miss that opportunity to fight back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We could ask you that very thing. Who is the real Shen Qingqiu?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu lets out a bitter laugh. Shen Yuan is afraid that he has lost control and tries to step forward to support him, but Liu Qingge stops him by placing a hand on his shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Stay with me,” he asks him in a whisper.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Shen Yuan can reply, Liu Qingge takes off his outer clothes to cover him with them. When Shen Yuan raises his head, he recognizes more familiar figures. There are almost all the Peak Lords, some of his disciples. And Luo Binghe at the Old Palace Master's side.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Their gazes meet and Shen Yuan trembles at the fury in the half-demon's eyes. This time it is different from Jinlan City. He needs to get Shen Jiu away from the protagonist or they will have just uselessly swapped positions.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You are all stupid. What do you have eyes for if you don't use them? Why do you have a tongue if you only speak nonsense?” Shen Jiu mocks everyone with a cruel laugh. “He is Shen Yuan, also known as Shen Qingqiu. I’m Shen Jiu, also known as Shen Qingqiu. And the answer to your question is so simple that it is an insult to intelligence to have to answer it: we are twin brothers.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan's eyes widen and he lets out a gasp. Brothers. He knows it's a lie, but even so, happiness spreads through his chest in the form of heat. Brothers. It is not true, he is a liar in the wrong body, but at that moment he understands that he would like to be Shen Jiu's brother.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When he died, Shen Yuan lost his life and this world offered him another.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When he died, Shen Yuan lost his friends, but he has met new people within the pages of a book.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When he died, Shen Yuan lost his family, but now he has someone who could be his brother.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He has to cover his face with his hands to not cry.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can't believe you're stupid enough to accept the words of murderers, carrion eaters, demons.” He spits out the last word with contempt and Shen Yuan stiffens as fear devours his happiness. Because Luo Binghe is listening to Shen Jiu's words with an icy grudge on his face. “Anyone can introduce themselves by my name and fool those pathetic demons. Or maybe they have lied to you to wreak havoc. Who was the idiot who dared to lock up a Peak Lord of Cang Qiong Mountain Sect just because of rumors?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But the other accusations...” A master from the Huan Hua Palace protests.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, yes. Where is the lady?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The crowd parts as Qiu Haitang approaches. There is doubt in her eyes and Shen Jiu looks at her coldly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It's the first time I've seen you, miss.” He lies without hesitation. “Tell me, did your slave have a twin brother?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She shakes her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Too bad, I grew up with my twin brother. In a rich house full of whims.” He keeps lying. “My family was friends with Yue Qingyuan's. Perhaps you trust the word of my sect leader more.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan nearly choked when Yue Qingyuan confirms Shen Jiu's words with a smile that seems sincere but is more false than a butterfly in winter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s true. Shen-shidi and I are childhood friends. We grew up almost together.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s more.” Shen Jiu adds with a wicked smirk. “The boy in your description would start cultivating too late, and Wu Yanzi is famous for crippling cultivation. How could he have become a powerful Peak Lord like us? I wish you the best of luck in finding him, miss. But next time be careful with your accusations.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan frowns. He's not the only one. Beside him, Liu Qingge's expression has darkened. Shen Yuan knows that Shen Jiu's past is true, but never before has he wondered how a slave managed to become a Peak Lord. He has the same talent as him and although they are not as powerful as Liu Qingge or Luo Binghe's, their ability is outstanding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It's another contradiction that the book never explained.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan looks at Shen Jiu's figure with many questions bubbling in his head. The accusations were always weak, based on hearsay and people's hatred rather than genuine evidence, but in the original book, he never said anything. Shen Qingqiu accepted the sentence knowing that he would never be free again without bothering to defend himself. </span>
<em>
<span>Why?</span>
</em>
<span> Shen Yuan begins to suspect that Shen Qingqiu no longer had any reason to live, while Shen Jiu still has someone to fight for.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan remembers his doubts when they traveled that day. And the stupid fear he felt. But the truth is that Shen Jiu cares about him, even though he is unfriendly and grumpy. He has taught him, he has protected him, he trusts him, and today he is saving him at the cost of ruining his reputation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But the worst wasn’t hearing that the Huan Hua Palace had dared to imprison a Peak Lord just for the words of some pathetic demons. Being a big sect doesn't prevent it from being run by stupid and arrogant people. The worst thing was that someone insinuated that Shen Yuan's favorite disciple was mistreated.” His voice is drenched in intense hatred that even makes Shen Yuan tremble. “A cowardly disciple who prefers to keep quiet. A disciple we no longer recognize. From today, our ties are broken, Luo Binghe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>People let out several groans and even some screams. The Old Palace Master covers his mouth with one hand. Luo Binghe's gaze is dark and it seems to say that those ties were already broken when Shen Jiu pushed him into the Abyss. The two look at each other, ignoring everyone around them without saying anything else.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Until Shen Jiu turns around to return to Shen Yuan's side. And with each step, he irretrievably breaks all the plans that Shen Yuan had prepared to improve the relationship between the villain and the protagonist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They are trapped by a fate that doesn’t change. And neither can escape being the enemy of the other.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu turns his back on them and gently drags Shen Yuan away from that courtyard, from the people and their accusations.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Stop, Master Shen," says the calm voice of the Old Palace Master. "You cannot leave with so many questions still unclear."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Once again, you are wrong."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I can."</span>
</p><p>
<span>His arrogance is terrifying and leaves everyone speechless. Not even Shen Yuan dares to protest. Although he looks back once. To Liu Qingge who has been frozen and confused, to Yue Qingyuan who approaches the Old Palace Master with a conciliatory smile. And to Luo Binghe, whose expression is the most indecipherable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu doesn't notice because he's too proud to turn around and look back, but Luo Binghe is keeping an eye on the two of them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Perhaps he is now free, but he has not solved any mysteries. His regrets are still a knot in his chest, Shen Jiu is in danger, and Luo Binghe is an uncontrollable piece in a plot that Shen Yuan no longer knows. But despite all those worries, he closes his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Thanks."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I've gotten that Gongyi Xiao boy in trouble," Shen Jiu comments as he draws his sword. "We should keep him."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You are incorrigible!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan can't help it: he starts laughing. He laughs so hard that it hurts, that he needs to hold onto Shen Jiu's shoulder to not trip. It's nice after so much stress. Shen Jiu huffs, annoyed, but helps him to mount Xiu Ya.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Stop being silly. You are going to fall.” He scolds him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry. About what you said before...” Shen Yuan bits his lip. He feels that fear again, which is actually disguised insecurity. “Can I call you Jiu-Ge?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do whatever you want, A-Yuan.”</span>

<p>Things seem brighter, more hopeful, and less threatening after a hot bath. Shen Yuan puts on clean clothes and stifles a yawn. It is past noon, but the stress of his stay in the Water Prison had turned to exhaustion inside his bones. </p><p>He would like to lie on the bed and close his eyes for a few minutes, but Shen Yuan finds the strength to sit in front of the table. To his surprise, Shen Jiu has prepared three cups of bamboo tea. If it was coffee or a more revitalizing drink, Shen Yuan would understand. Right now, he would drink three cups of coffee or more. But it's just tea and the cup is arranged on the table as if they're waiting for someone else.</p><p>"Jiu-Ge..." He mutters, cautious. The name on his mouth sounds strange. Shen Yuan wants to get used to calling him that and forever forget that he was once a character in a novel.</p><p>At that moment, someone knocks on the door and Yue Qingyuan enters. Although the sect leader smiles, there is fear in his eyes. He looks at the two of them, conscientiously at Shen Yuan and imploring at Shen Jiu.</p><p>“Xiao Jiu, I deserve an explanation.”</p><p>Shen Yuan stiffens. It is the first time that he hears "Xiao Jiu" instead of the characteristic "Shidi" with which Yue Qingyuan always addressed Shen Qingqiu. They didn't usually coincide much either, as Shen Jiu always avoided that as he now remembers. <em> Is this a hidden backstory? </em> He thinks as he holds his teacup with shaking hands.</p><p>“Please, Zhangmen-shixiong, have a seat. It is a long story.”</p><p>And the three of them end up around the same table, each with a cup of tea that no one drinks. Suddenly, Shen Yuan is very ashamed and afraid just for existing. He shouldn't be there and maybe being a secret wasn't bad. After years of being Shen Qingqiu, now that they look at him and see him is terrifying. With Luo Binghe he didn't feel like that, perhaps because Luo Binghe never mistook him for another person.</p><p>"I found you, Xiao Jiu," Yue Qingyuan mutters in a broken voice. "There was no other baby. Only you. It is unlikely that I wouldn’t have seen another. And there wasn't a child identical to you among the slaves." Shen Yuan’s eyes widen. He knew Shen Jiu's past from the book, but he had never imagined that Yue Qingyuan was another slave as well. "How now do you have a twin brother?"</p><p>“It is a complicated story. You won’t like it.“ He warns him with his cold nonchalance. “We met a few years ago by chance. Shen Yuan was a rogue cultivator.” Shen Yuan lifts the teacup to his lips to hide a sigh. His false brother’s lies don't end. “It was a shock at first. Suddenly, there is a person identical to you and I found it terrifying. He also had a talent similar to mine and his knowledge is quite interesting.” Shen Jiu pauses. “So, I kidnapped him and locked him in my house.”</p><p>Shen Yuan spits out the tea. And he would have choked if Shen Jiu hadn't slapped his back with one hand while Yue Qingyuan mutters a strangled groan.</p><p>“You did WHAT?”</p><p>“At first, I found him hateful. Someone like me but that he hadn’t suffered the same.” Shen Yuan raises his head and looks at him curiously. Shen Jiu speaks with his eyes almost closed and his voice is empty as if he has locked all of his emotions. Shen Yuan wonders for the first time if there is still something else about him that he doesn't know yet. “However, Shen Yuan was useful to me. Now I could avoid the most annoying meetings while I did more useful things.”</p><p>“Xiao... Jiu...” Yue Qingyuan is so pale that he seems on the verge of a qi deviation. “Did you allow a stranger to take your place as Peak Lord?”</p><p>“Yes. But over time Shen Yuan ceased to be a stranger to me. He has helped me with the disciples and together we talked about the dual cultivation classes or the tests we prepared for the Alliance Conference.” Shen Jiu pauses to look Yue Qingyuan straight into the eyes. “I trust him.”</p><p>Shen Yuan feels a pleasant warmth in his chest. He stares at his cup of tea, unable to look at the other two. There are too many emotions in a short period.</p><p>“Anyway, it's a relief the secret has been revealed. Lately, it was being quite awkward to leave the sect together without being discovered. Or stop that brute shidi from knocking the door down.”</p><p>“Xiao Jiu...”</p><p>“Shen Yuan has more patience than me, so you can bother him from now on. Although I warn you that his ideas are very strange and he uses an unknown vocabulary sometimes.”</p><p>“Xiao Jiu.”</p><p>“But you can't monopolize Shen Yuan. I'm a little tired of everyone and everything and would rather go away with him for a while. Although first I would like to dismantle the Huan Hua Palace stone by stone...”</p><p>“XIAO JIU!” Yue Qingyuan's scream startles the two Shens. The sect leader runs a hand over his forehead. He seems incredibly exhausted. “Qing Jing Peak cannot have two Peak Lords.”</p><p>Shen Jiu smiles. His smile is terrifying, without a hint of joy, typical of a poisonous snake.</p><p>“Zhangmen-shixiong, I asked you never to call me that. But you break your word. Again.” There is so much bitterness in his words that even Shen Yuan shivers. “You owe me more than many apologies. You owe me an explanation and never speak to me again. But I can forgive you that debt if Shen Yuan stays.”</p><p>An awkward silence sharp as a thousand thorns spreads over the bamboo house. Shen Yuan opens his mouth, but all the words die in his throat. <em> Did you just blackmail Zhangmen-shixiong? For me? </em> He blinks in a daze and his gaze shifts from Shen Jiu's raging determination to Yue Qingyuan's strange sadness.</p><p>Fortunately, someone knocks on the door at that moment.</p><p>Mu Qingfang enters with an apologetic smile on his lips.</p><p>“Next time, I would appreciate Shen-shixiong if you would allow me to do my job before leaving dramatically.” After rebuking Shen Jiu, the healer walks to Shen Yuan, who meekly extends his wrist. “Well, at least I know how to differentiate the two of you. It seems that Shen-ershixiong appreciates his health.”</p><p>The normality with which Mu Qingfang talks about them softens the atmosphere. Shen Jiu doesn't relax, but at least he no longer seems willing to destroy an entire sect. Though the temptation shines in his eyes as they wait for Mu Qingfang's verdict.</p><p>The healer smiles when he finishes checking him.</p><p>"I was scared by the inhuman conditions of the Water Prison, but Shen-ershixiong is just tired. Your cultivation is intact, can I examine your injuries?"</p><p>Shen Yuan is a bit embarrassed to undress for such stupid injuries.</p><p>"It's nothing. They're just welts."</p><p>"A-Yuan..."</p><p>"Luo Binghe untied me." He looks into Shen Jiu’s eyes. "He helped me..." Of course, Shen Jiu is thinking about how the past two years he has told him how terrifying Luo Binghe will be. And maybe he is. “We need to talk about him. Alone.”</p><p>Shen Jiu reluctantly nods.</p><p>On the third occasion, the door opens with a sharp kick that almost knocks it to the ground and startles everyone except Shen Jiu, who covers his face with his hands, and Shen Yuan, who no longer has to hide any secrets.</p><p>“SHEN QINGQIU!” Liu Qingge yells. “I should have known! You couldn't be nice all of a sudden!” Shen Jiu throws a fan at his head and he catches it without blinking or being surprised. “Who is Shen Yuan and who is Shen Jiu?”</p><p>“I’m Shen Yuan,” he tilts his head to hide the embarrassment that colors his cheeks. Yue Qingyuan was only looking at Shen Jiu and Mu Qingfang has acted as usual, but Liu Qingge's sudden appearance reminds him that he has lied to them for a long time.</p><p>And Liu Qingge, loyal, honest, and patient, didn’t deserve it.</p><p>"Does it matter?" Shen Jiu huffs. "You always give us the wrong gift. I'm sure you'll mistake us again."</p><p>A faint blush covers the cheeks and ears of the War God.</p><p>“You…!” He takes a deep breath until he calms down. “The Lingxi Caves?”</p><p>“It was A-Yuan.”</p><p>“The night hunts?”</p><p>“Me. All of them.”</p><p>“The succubus mission?”</p><p>“A-Yuan.”</p><p>Yue Qingyuan clears his throat, interrupting the interrogation.</p><p>“Perhaps you should clarify that matter in private, shidi. Before we should...”</p><p>But before he can finish the sentence, the Peak Lord of An Ding Peak enters the bamboo house in a hysterical whirlwind, disheveled and pale.</p><p>"WHO IS SHEN YUAN?" He screams desperately. His gaze shifts from Shen Jiu's quiet arrogance to Shen Yuan's confusion. "Proud Immortal Demon Way?"</p><p>And Shen Yuan's teacup falls from his hands. <em> Another transmigrator? </em> He thinks, stunned, as Shang Qinghua begins to scream with joy.</p><p>"I knew it! I knew the plot didn't make sense! HAHAHHAHAHAHAHA!"</p><p>Someone clears his throat and then Shang Qinghua discovers that he is behaving like a lunatic. On the doorstep, arms crossed and smiling sarcastically is Qi Qingqi.</p><p>"I knew we had to talk about the two Shen Qingqiu, but I didn't expect that the meeting would be at Qing Jin Peak."</p><p>Her words bring them back to reality. There are many Peak Lords huddled in the bamboo house. Yue Qingyuan sighs and stands up, ignoring the cup of tea that he hasn’t touched.</p><p>“We should reunite at Qiong Ding Peak. This is a matter that the twelve of us should discuss... The thirteen.” He adds while looking at Shen Yuan, who turns his head away, uncomfortable with the attention.</p><p>One by one, they all leave the bamboo house. The two of them are the last to leave. In a fit of courage, Shen Yuan grabs Shen Jiu's arm.</p><p>"Are you sure of this?"</p><p>"More than ever. With that unhinged beast on the loose, you need the protection of a big sect."</p><p>Shen Yuan gulps, noting the uneasiness deep in his throat.</p><p>"Luo Binghe doesn't want to hurt me. He always knew we were two..."</p><p>"Our former disciple is a treacherous vermin," he hissed with a rage that left Shen Yuan speechless. "He has chosen to place with Huan Hua Palace, he kept silent while they wrongfully accused you!"</p><p>"But he untied me! He..."</p><p>“Give you his robes? And what else? I got you out of a miserable and disgusting cell.”</p><p>Luo Binghe promised to release him, but he didn’t.</p><p>Shen Yuan shakes his head to chase away those hideous ideas.</p><p>“Luo Binghe protected me from the Little Palace Mistress. He kept me company and brought me food.”</p><p>Shen Yuan should tell him about the blood, about the threat of the demon army. And after thinking about those details, his trust in Luo Binghe falters.</p><p>“I don’t care.” Shen Jiu growls, stubborn. "Do you know how I felt when I found out what had happened? It was the infamous Water Prison, A-Yuan! They didn't even let Liu Qingge visit you when he demanded it!"</p><p>Something inside Shen Yuan squirms as he realizes that Luo Binghe lied to him. But maybe it was just an innocent lie. Trembling, he laces his fingers together.</p><p>“He doesn't want to hurt me. I know that. He could do it but he didn't. He took care of me, he protected me.” Shen Yuan takes a deep breath. “But I don't know what he wants from you.”</p><p>And that's what scares him. Perhaps Luo Binghe would never inhumanly torture him as he does in the book, but perhaps he does it to Shen Jiu and that would destroy Shen Yuan. Feeling an intense panic, Shen Yuan hugs him tightly. At first, Shen Jiu tenses. Afterward, he awkwardly hugs him back.</p><p>“I’ll protect you, A-Yuan...”</p><p>“You don't understand it, Jiu-Ge! I’m the one who has to protect you!! So, please, stay with Liu-shidi or Zhangmen-shixiong. Stop being alone and keeping your distance from everyone else. Please.”</p><p>Shen Jiu growls.</p><p>“Now with your words.”</p><p>“Gr, fine... I promise you.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Once upon a time, there was a young boy.</p><p>The boy had a brilliant talent and a heart so big that his emotions were too intense. There was no admiration, but adoration. No appreciation, but blind loyalty. No disappointment, just hatred.</p><p>After a miserable life, the boy believed that in Cang Qiong Mountain Sect he would be happy. However, his shizun was a cold immortal who never looked at him. The boy tried very hard, but only received disdain and punishment.</p><p>But one day his shizun changed.</p><p>His shizun became kinder. He protected him, gave him a balm for his wounds, invited him into his carriage, and handed him another manual. The boy's heart filled with happiness as he finally got his shizun's attention.</p><p>After three years in seclusion, his shizun changed again. And he trembled, terrified that the cold shizun that despised him would return. But then, shizun chose him to face the demons. He said: "I trust him."</p><p>There were no smiles or those warm glances the boy had grown used to. But shizun said it confidently. He believed in him! The boy tried his best to not disappoint him. And although he achieved a victory, shizun didn’t even look at him. His disdain saddened him and erased his smile. What had he done wrong to make shizun ignore him again? Had he failed despite winning?</p><p>That night the boy had a very strange dream. Shizun was there and was back to being nice and even congratulating him. At the end of the dream, the boy met an elder demon.</p><p>"I will be your master," said the demon.</p><p>But the boy refused. He already had a shizun.</p><p>"A shizun?" The dream demon scoffed. "Which of the two are you talking about? I notice two consciousnesses, although I‘ve only been able to bring the one that was asleep."</p><p>Two shizuns. The boy's eyes widened. Two shizuns. And then he understood. One shizun was kind and smiled when he thought no one noticed, instructed them with games, and always complimented him. The other shizun was more serious and cold, he kept his distance from everyone and even avoided the other Peak Lords.</p><p>The boy wanted to earn the respect of both of them.</p><p>"Shizun," he muttered once. "Is it true that all demons are evil?"</p><p>The cold shizun huffed and a wry smile spread across his face.</p><p>“Only someone like you would ask such a naive question! Don't be silly, Luo Binghe, humans can be worse than demons."</p><p>Luo Binghe now finally understands his shizun.</p>

<p>
<span>That Peak Lords meeting is the most unusual of all the meetings the Qing generation has ever had. It is the first time that they are thirteen. At the Qing Jing Peak seat, there are two identical people today. And although the meeting is to decide what will happen to Shen Qingqiu, Liu Qingge is not paying attention. He is still stunned by the discovery and he can only stare at the twins while the other Peak Lords speak at the same time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now that they are together, Liu Qingge appreciates their differences. Shen Yuan holds the fan that he gave to him after the incident with the succubi. Although he seems calm, he is hiding behind the fan and Liu Qingge suspects that he is more nervous than he appears. Meanwhile, Shen Jiu is the one who speaks with a determined and arrogant voice, so sharp that no one dares to ask uncomfortable questions. He holds on his knees the fan that Liu Qingge gave him after the disastrous (date) meal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I know it's an irregularity," Shen Jiu says after hitting the table with the fan and catching their attention. "But first, this will be Zhangmen-shixiong's decision." Yue Qingyuan also doesn't speak. He's pale and tired like he's been emotionally beaten. "Second, I warn that A-Yuan and I are not parting ways. I think Cang Qiong Mountain Sect would rather have two Peak Lords from Qing Jing Peak than none."</span>
</p><p>
<span>It is blatant blackmail. In the past, Liu Qingge would have been enraged and challenged Shen Qingqiu for breaking all the rules. But now, he thinks of his own sister. Would he be able to challenge the sect for Liu Mingyan? Surely. Liu Qingge has always relied on his sword more than dialogue.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Furthermore, he has selfish and personal reasons for wanting both twins to stay in the sect. Liu Qingge clenches his fists on his knees and tries to control his racing pulse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He is still in love, but no longer knows with whom.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"And third, we have a common enemy." Shen Yuan stiffens upon hearing his brother and he turns his head to look at him. "I'm sorry to report that we have a trifling problem with Luo Binghe, our former disciple."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I thought the problem was the Huan Hua Palace," comments Qi Qingqi, angrily.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What's wrong with your disciple?" Liu Qingge looks at both twins, still remembering the sense of danger he felt in Jinlan City. Luo Binghe acted with Shen Qingqiu (no, </span>
<em>
<span>Shen Yuan</span>
</em>
<span>, he corrects himself) with an improper closeness between disciple and master.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"He is a half-demon."</span>
</p><p>
<span>The Peak Lords pale. No one says anything, everyone looks at them in disbelief. Until Liu Qingge startles all of them by hitting the table with a fist. </span>
<em>
<span>I knew it!</span>
</em>
<span> He thinks.</span>
<em>
<span> I knew there was something wrong!</span>
</em>
<span> That's why Luo Binghe beat him by hunting sowers: he cheated.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A… half-demon,” Yue Qingyuan mutters cautiously.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"In case you're wondering, no, I didn't know when I accepted him as my disciple," Shen Jiu growls in obvious annoyance. "I found out during the Alliance Conference and then I sent him to the Endless Abyss. No, Luo Binghe wasn’t behind the Alliance Conference sabotage either."</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But we never knew who sabotaged the Alliance Conference and now the Old Palace Master is allied with Luo Binghe, a half-demon...” Qi Qingqi says with the obvious intention of looking for an excuse to cut off the Old Palace Master's head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge understands her. After all, she is one of his best friends.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu sighs before demanding their attention again with a fan hit against the table. At this rate, Liu Qingge will soon have to give him another.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No, the Alliance Conference sabotage was done by another powerful demon named Mobei-Jun. That matter is now resolved."</span>
</p><p>
<span>They all look at him. He doesn’t say anything. Everyone waits for him to clarify his words, but Shen Jiu insists on hiding his secrets. And Qi Qingqi snorts, disappointed. Shang Qinghua lets out a sigh that almost seems relieved. Mu Qingfang is worried and Yue Qingyuan's expression has darkened. It is the first time that Liu Qingge has seen his sect leader so angry and something inside him wants to intervene to protect the two twins. Specifically, the stubborn and proud Shen Jiu, although Liu Qingge is a mess of feelings.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was almost easy to accept that he was in love with Shen Qingqiu, the fussy and unfriendly man who saved his life, who sometimes smiles and jokes with him. But Shen Qingqiu is now two people and his feelings are still mixed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We shouldn't worry about the past, but about the present." Shen Jiu adds after clicking his tongue in annoyance. "Luo Binghe is dangerous."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"He's just a half-demon, not a full demon," Liu Qingge grumbles, still upset that he lost when they were hunting sowers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Surely this traitor was in cahoots with the sowers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"He has heavenly demon blood."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yue Qingyuan covers his face with one hand and sighs deeply. It's a mystery that the sect leader hasn't broken out yet. The rest, on the other hand, are frozen by so many surprises and no one says anything.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan nudges Shen Jiu.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Luo Binghe has tried to isolate my brother from the sect. His intentions are not clear, but he is dangerous. Please, I need your help to protect A-Yuan."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu makes a feint of a bow, but his twin nudges him again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Not that!" He scolds him with a hiss before looking at them. It is the first time that Shen Yuan has addressed the Peak Lords without pretending to be someone else and Liu Qingge can notice his nervousness. "My brother pushed Luo Binghe into the Abyss and he hates him. He is the one he wants to lock up and torture..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"As if that brat could," Shen Jiu grumbles.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Please, I need your help to protect Jiu-Ge."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You can count on me." Liu Qingge speaks without thinking about what he says. Noticing the gaze of both twins, he crosses his arms and turns his head to the side. "I'm the War God of Bai Zhan Peak." He adds as if that justifies his need to protect them. Both of them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge decides to keep quiet for the rest of the meeting, lost in his thoughts. He hates feeling this nervous, with a lump in his throat and another in his chest, with his heart torn between disappointment, affection, rivalry, and desire.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before, understanding himself was easier.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yue Qingyuan ends the meeting by asking everyone to leave to speak with Shen Jiu alone. One by one, everyone gets up to go outside. The Peak Lords whisper among themselves. Liu Qingge feels a dry throat upon discovering that Shen Yuan is alone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And he decides to approach him when the two meet in the Qiong Ding Peak gardens.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh, Liu-shidi!" He exclaims with a nervous smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan is the one who smiles the most. His nature seems much kinder and more relaxed than Shen Jiu's. Liu Qingge still doesn't understand how he could have gotten confused.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He bows his head to Shen Yuan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I have never properly thanked you for saving me at the Lingxi Caves."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It was nothing!" Shen Yuan waves his hand to dismiss it. “Anyone could have done it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>"And I'm sorry." He grits his teeth, furious. "I failed you in Jinlan City."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"That was my fault, not yours." Shen Yuan sighs seeing that he is still with his head down. And he reaches out his hands to force Liu Qingge to stand up. "I did it to get my brother away from Luo Binghe. I'm the one who should apologize for scaring you. And..." Shen Yuan smiles and Liu Qingge gasps. It's a less awkward, brighter smile that reminds him of all those good times together. "Thank you, Liu-shidi. It made me very happy to know that you tried to visit me at the Water Prison."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge doesn’t reply. He clenches his fists since that was another defeat. Liu Qingge has always had it all: talent, a sword, his blood family, and his martial family. His defeats have been rare and insignificant and yet he has failed his most important person.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At that moment, in front of Shen Yuan, Liu Qingge finally acknowledges his feelings. He is no longer disappointed even when Shen Yuan bows to apologize for lying to him. Because he is in love with his laughs and smiles, with that sweet little voice when he tries to make fun of him, with his conciliatory tone to avoid arguments.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He loves Shen Yuan and would do anything for him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, shidi,” says another voice, much more malicious. "That's timely."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge turns around and sees that Shen Jiu has already left and walks towards them. His smile is colder and more artificial.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I need to talk with you, shidi." He demands and walks past them as if he is waiting for Liu Qingge to follow him. "See you at home, A-Yuan."</span>
</p><p>
<span>It is an inexplicable mystery how no one has discovered them before when they are clearly so different. Liu Qingge bows his head to Shen Yuan and walks after Shen Jiu, the man who once swore to kill him, who visited brothels...</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge stops. And he forgets that line of thoughts. He now knows that it was Shen Yuan who defended Shen Jiu from the rumors, confirming that they were false. Liu Qingge blushes with embarrassment as he realizes that he has been carried away by his prejudice once again. Nervous, he looks at Shen Jiu.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Forget the sentimentality my brother has said," Shen Jiu growls. "Shen Yuan doesn't have a sword. I do. I need your help to protect him."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge blinks, confused.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You need me?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why are you all so dense?” He sighs, rolling his eyes. "Yes, shidi, I need you. I need your strength and your fame as a War God. And I don't trust anyone else."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge feels his heart beat faster and faster. He believed that understanding his feelings would be as simple as choosing. And for a few minutes, he had convinced himself that his feelings were for Shen Yuan's gentleness. But that grudgingly acknowledged show of appreciation from Shen Jiu has made him happy, very happy. And then Liu Qingge remembers that it was Shen Jiu that he chased the first time he was poisoned by succubi. Shen Jiu is much more grumpy and unfriendly, but that also makes his smiles more unique.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge lowers his gaze. A tremor arises from his heart and shakes his entire body. And he understands that he is in love with both of them.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>“Finally you are alone!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan turns and sees the Lord of An Ding Peak. Only this time, he knows that Shang Qinghua is not Shang Qinghua. He is not a traitor and a spy, but a person like him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Another transmigrator?" Shen Yuan frowns.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"YES!" The immortal has happy tears in his eyes. "Now it all makes sense! Why was the plot drifting, why was Shen Qingqiu so OOC... It's always been you!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan becomes defensive. He considers that the plot has improved.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You don't know how long I've been asking the System what was going on. So... It’s Shen Yuan your real name?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>He nods.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What's yours?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shang Qinghua." He blushes a little perhaps from the shame of sharing a name with such an irrelevant secondary. But Shang Qinghua quickly recovers. "You're amazing bro! And also the reason why I've had nightmares for three years. Shen Jiu is more terrifying than Luo Binghe. Was it also your idea to force me to spy on Luo Binghe?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"SHEN JIU DID WHAT?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>At least now Shen Yuan understands Shang Qinghua's cryptic message before leaving for Jinlan City.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yes! Yes! Yes! He discovered me after the Alliance Conference and threatened me to pass the information on Luo Binghe's progress to him."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan takes a deep breath. This time, it is Shen Jiu who will be scolded when they return to the bamboo house. Meanwhile, Shang Qinghua keeps babbling nonstop.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I never imagined that I would meet a fan in my book! So now you are the scum villain's brother? What was it like? I never wrote that character to have a brother since he should be miserable and bitter..."</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu sighs as he rubs the bridge of his nose.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"A-Yuan, can you explain to me why you have tried to strangle the Lord of An Ding Peak?"</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Yue Qingyuan is pale and exhausted, but his voice sounds firm and almost furious.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"First, I find out that for years there have been two Shen Qingqiu in front of my nose and neither has said anything to me. Then, that you have kidnapped a person just because he looks like you, that now you want us to accept him as another Peak Lord because he is your brother, your disciple is also a heavenly demon... And now you are trying to assassinate Shang Qinghua? Xiao Jiu, I need an explanation now."</span>

<p>Shen Jiu looks at Shang Qinghua as if he is the worst of the scums while the unfortunate author of PIDW whimpers. Shen Yuan is surprised that he agreed to speak with them that morning even though a few days earlier they both nearly murdered him.</p><p>Honestly, Shang Qinghua deserves it for creating such a horrible story. And for killing Shen Jiu in the book, along with Liu Qingge, Yue Qingyuan, his disciples, and 99% of the male population. Shen Yuan sighs. He still can't believe the PIDW author is stuck in the role of an irrelevant minor character. Caught between the two Shen, Shang Qinghua trembles under their contemptuous gaze. Although for different reasons. Ironically, Shen Jiu has relaxed knowing that he is not a true spy, but someone forced to play his role like Shen Yuan. Shen Yuan has only been able to tell him that Shang Qinghua is the reason why certain events must happen.</p><p>But he is also the reason for other things much more horrible and Shen Yuan doesn’t think to forgive him yet.</p><p>"So, Jiu-Ge," he begins as he sets his cup of tea on the table. "When were you going to tell me that Shang-shidi was your spy?"</p><p>"When were you going to tell me that you knew he was a spy?"</p><p>Shen Yuan blushes with embarrassment.</p><p>"I had no evidence and his role is insignificant."</p><p>"Hey!"</p><p>"Furthermore, his destiny was to die miserably and he deserves it after the demonic invasion and the sabotage of the Alliance Conference."</p><p>"Hmh… sorry?"</p><p>"It is a comfort to know that he will die miserably." Shen Jiu smiles terrifyingly.</p><p>Shang Qinghua seems about to cry.</p><p>At least, Shen Yuan now understands the cryptic message before going to Jinlan City. Too bad that he couldn't interpret it in time.</p><p>"Do you know what Luo Binghe plans?" He asks Shang Qinghua, who shakes his head.</p><p>"I’m a servant of Mobei-Jun and I receive direct orders from him, not from Luo Binghe."</p><p>"Useless," Shen Jiu hisses.</p><p>"But you have to know something," Shen Yuan insists. "Luo Binghe has returned two years earlier, the Jinlan City sowers event shouldn't have happened and his behavior is… odd. Unpredictable."</p><p>"That is probably your fault, not mine," Shang Qinghua grumbles. Although the three of them are sitting in front of the table, he still hasn't touched his cup of tea. "Luo Binghe isn't supposed to have two masters, just one. I... I really don't know what he's thinking about. If this was the original story, now he would only be thinking about revenge."</p><p>Shen Yuan swallows hard. He and Shang Qinghuan have paled as they recall the horrendous events that take place at PIDW. Shen Jiu looks at them curiously, his chin resting on both hands and his elbows on the table.</p><p>"Don't be exaggerated. He is not the first demon with an army and a tantrum."</p><p>Shang Qinghua turns to Shen Yuan with his wide eyes and dilated pupils.</p><p>"He doesn’t know?" He hisses, terrified.</p><p>Obviously, Shen Jiu can hear him. He raises an eyebrow and although his expression is as cold as ever, his annoyance is evident.</p><p>"Know what? The stupid harem of hundreds of women? Is it also your fault that my disciple turns into a beast in heat?"</p><p>Shang Qinghua apologizes with teary eyes to avoid being hit again. Shen Yuan ignores his babbling and looks at his brother curiously. It is the first time since the incident at the Alliance Conference that Shen Jiu has recognized Luo Binghe as his disciple. Since then he has refused to say his name, sometimes calling him <em> beast </em>. That little detail burns inside his chest like a spark of hope.</p><p>When Shang Qinghua is gone, he will tell Shen Jiu about the fake jade guanyin pendant. Shen Yuan still believes that if Shen Jiu apologizes to Luo Binghe and uses that special item, he will be able to appease his anger.</p><p>"We haven't summoned you to hear you whimper," Shen Jiu hisses as he hits the table with his fan. "You are both terrified of our enemy, I can see it. But hiding and running will not change anything. You have both seen Luo Binghe recently. I need information. Now."</p><p>Shen Yuan takes a deep breath. In the last few days since his return from the Water Prison, he has avoided that conversation to sort out his ideas. And the curiosity of the other Peak Lords and his disciples haven’t allowed them to speak calmly either.</p><p>"I don't think Luo Binghe is behind the Jinlan City sowers," he begins.</p><p>His cat hears him speak and appears to rub its head against his back until Shen Yuan grabs the animal and sits it on his lap. The animal purrs and Shang Qinghua looks at it in amazement: "You have a cat too? Very suitable bro," he mutters.</p><p>"Why do you think so?" Shen Jiu intervenes. "I know you appreciate Luo Binghe, but you cannot let your affection for him blind you."</p><p>"Cannibalism is characteristic of southern demons. Luo Binghe has returned too soon and hasn’t yet unified the Realm Demon, am I right?" He turns to Shang Qinghua.</p><p>"That's true. He is in league with the North and Mobei-Jun."</p><p>"Perhaps the Jinlan City incident was caused by an enemy from the South who needs food for his troops," Shen Yuan theorizes.</p><p>Meanwhile, Shen Jiu listens to both of them very attentively while he takes notes.</p><p>"I don't like that we have to face another unknown demon as well," he comments. Shen Jiu has frowned and has a thoughtful expression. "Luo Binghe is a simple enemy since we know his abilities and have emotional ties to him." They both look at him skeptically. "However, if we do not control the unknown demon, the humans will be harmed as happened in Jinlan City. However, it is also an element that we can use to weaken Luo Binghe."</p><p>"I don't want to fight him," Shen Yuan reminds him. "Forget what I have told you these years. Luo Binghe wasn’t aggressive with me and helped us neutralize the sowers."</p><p>"He lied to get you locked up in that horrible place ..."</p><p>"Technically, he didn't lie, he just kept quiet. I suspect he planned to free me without dropping the charges to lock you up. You are his target."</p><p>"It's true, Jiu bro!" Shen Jiu's expression darkens upon hearing Shang Qinghua speak. "My evil son only thinks about revenge! You have to be very careful."</p><p>"I don't listen to advice from traitors or spies. How do I know you won't betray us?"</p><p>Something is haunting his voice and Shen Yuan fails to identify it. It's something slimy and cold, which makes Shang Qinghua pale even more.</p><p>"I would never do it."</p><p>"You have already betrayed the sect twice."</p><p>"But I decided to help you these years! I also didn't tell Zhangmen-shixiong that you blackmailed me to get double the salary! And now I understand why."</p><p>"Oh." Shen Yuan smiles. His brother is so cold that those gestures always warm his heart. "But you can't blackmail your martial brothers, Jiu-Ge. Or kidnap anyone. We've already had this conversation."</p><p>Shen Jiu clicks his tongue with disdain. Unfortunately, he is not going to change his mind. <em> I have to do something about his criminal impulses </em>, Shen Yuan values. Reforming a scum villain is pretty tricky.</p><p>"There is something that can explain Luo Binghe's attitude: Xin Mo." Shen Yuan continues, willing to fight for a happy future in which the darkened protagonist and the redeemed villain can be friends. Or, at least, acquaintances without murderous intentions. "Thanks to our help and teachings, it is understandable that Luo Binghe took less time to cross the Endless Abyss. However, mastering Xin Mo is quite hard."</p><p>"Stupid parasitic sword," Shen Jiu growls as he consults his notes. "From what you told me, Xin Mo can only be quenched with violence and dual cultivation, right?"</p><p>"Indeed. Luo Binghe will have no problem with..." Shen Yuan blushes at the thought.</p><p>Nothing more needs to be said, as Shen Jiu nods in understanding.</p><p>"With such an exorbitant harem and his knowledge, he will be able to perform dual cultivation safely and responsibly."</p><p>"WAIT A MOMENT!" Shang Qinghua has stood up and looks at both brothers with perplexity. "Did you teach my protagonist stallion sex ed?"</p><p>"Stallion?" Shen Jiu repeats with a confused expression.</p><p>Shen Yuan prefers to ignore him.</p><p>"Right now his harem will surely be small. Perhaps Sha Hualing and some demoness, although in Huan Hua Palace he is already quite loved. Probably some female disciples have already surrendered to his charms."</p><p>"Sha Hualing no," interjects Shang Qinghua. "She is one of her generals. I have seen her in several meetings that Mobei-Jun attended. There is nothing between them."</p><p>"How odd..."</p><p>"Better." Shen Jiu nods and Shen Yuan seems to see a satisfied grin behind the fan. "If he turns into a beast that collects women to quench a demonic sword, I will castrate him myself."</p><p>"Even if they are demons?"</p><p>"Yes. Demons or humans, all women deserve to be respected."</p><p>Shen Yuan bows his head with shame, ignoring Shang Qinghua's malicious laugh. One of Peerless Cucumber's most famous comments was the demand for the castration of Shen Qingqiu. And the author remembers. And he also remembers. When Shen Jiu reaches for his cup of tea to drink, Shang Qinghua nudges Shen Yuan.</p><p>"If you say anything to him, I'll tell him all the crap you wrote," Shen Yuan warns him through clenched teeth.</p><p>Shang Qinghua nods and the two make a pact of silence.</p><p>"I'm not worried about dual cultivation. Even if his harem is small, with a cultivation partner the problem is solved," Shen Jiu continues. "The problem is the violent and murderous impulses of that sword. As long as he fights the demons, there will be no problem. But once he conquers the Demon Realm as you have predicted, he will have to quench those impulses elsewhere. The best thing is to snatch the sword from him and seal it. "</p><p>"Luo Binghe will never allow it," Shen Yuan sighs.</p><p>"I didn't say that I need his permission."</p><p>In addition to blackmail and kidnapping, Shen Yuan adds robbery to Shen Jiu's list of hypothetical crimes.</p><p>"But it's not a bad idea," he confirms after pondering. "The link between him and Xin Mo is still weak. We can remove it from him."</p><p>"And we have Zheng Yang's shards, I will speak with Wei Qingwei to re-forge it."</p><p>Shang Qinghua wipes a fake tear away.</p><p>"You know guys? Listening to you makes me feel hopeful. Maybe none of us will die!"</p><p>"Remember that if at any time you betray us, lie to us, or give us false information to benefit Luo Binghe, I will kill you in the most painful way possible."</p><p>"Yes, yes..." Shang Qinghua shakes a hand dismissively. "You always tell me the same thing, Jiu bro."</p><p>"Stop calling me that!"</p><p>"You won't let me call you shixiong because you don't consider me a martial brother anymore! Why not Jiu bro?"</p><p>Shen Yuan covers his mouth with his fan to stifle a laugh as Shang Qinghua leaves the bamboo house before Shen Jiu throws a kettle at his head.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Shen Yuan needs time to get used to his new life as himself. He's been imitating someone else for so long that he's forgotten what it's like to be Shen Yuan. And there is something that he has not confessed to anyone, not even his brother: he is afraid to show his true nature.</p><p>Although hated by all, Shen Jiu is elegant and refined, unfriendly without being rude. Instead, he is critical and lazy, very different from a distant immortal. Therefore, the presence of Shang Qinghua is a relief, because when the two of them are alone, Shen Yuan can act as himself without fear of consequences.</p><p>Shen Jiu doesn't like when he spends time with that rat and often accompanies them.</p><p>That morning, the two examine their disciples at Qing Jing Peak while discussing Luo Binghe. His inactivity in recent weeks seems to indicate that he must be busy with his demonic conquering. Although Shen Jiu is more concerned with the silence of the Old Palace Master.</p><p>"That scum must be planning something."</p><p>"His daughter's wedding with Luo Binghe?"</p><p>Shen Jiu hums thoughtfully.</p><p>"We must avoid that wedding," he finally responds. "I don't care if Luo Binghe entangles with some female disciples, but the Little Palace Mistress is the heiress to the Huan Hua Palace. If Luo Binghe takes over one of the two most powerful sects, we'll be in trouble."</p><p>Shen Yuan rolls his eyes. <em> Seriously, Jiu-Ge? Two of the most powerful sects? What about Tianyi Overlook and Zhao Hua Temple? </em> However, despite the tension they feel, Shen Yuan smiles at the thought of how much fun it would be to ruin the Little Palace Mistress's wedding as revenge for what happened in the Water Prison. Then he remembers Luo Binghe's anger and his temper fades slightly.</p><p>Curious, he glances at Shen Jiu. Despite his confident and indifferent appearance, he knows that his brother has had nightmares recently. Sometimes Shen Yuan gets up to play a song to him until Shen Jiu's breathing calms down.</p><p>They walk silently, pretending to watch over their disciples, but lost in their thoughts, when Liu Qingge appears with his characteristic brusqueness. Shen Yuan smiles at him as Shen Jiu snorts, though he knows deep down that he doesn't displease him as much as before.</p><p>Shen Jiu has always complained a lot about Liu Qingge. However, there are a lot of people he detests: the Old Palace Master, Yue Qingyuan, Shang Qinghua... He never talks about them, as if none of them deserves that honor. With Liu Qingge he does it and that is why Shen Yuan suspects that he is special to Shen Jiu. <em> Better </em> , he thinks happy. <em> Liu-shidi is a great friend, the best uber driver, and so honorable that it is hilarious to tease him. I'm glad the two of them are getting along better. </em></p><p>"Wait," he whispers to Shen Jiu while holding his arm and covering his face with the fan so Liu Qingge cannot read his lips. "Let's see if he can recognize us."</p><p>"Oh," Shen Jiu's soul is mischievous since he smirks maliciously.</p><p>Fourth crime: identity theft. But this time, they are both guilty.</p><p>The two of them turn to face their shidi, who stops in front of them.</p><p>"Hi, shidi!" Shen Jiu greets him with a sweet voice and an almost flirtatious smile. Meanwhile, Shen Yuan tries to stay serious while he holds back his laughter. "What is the reason for your visit?"</p><p>Liu Qingge takes out from inside his robe two fans, as beautiful as all the ones he has given them. And as always, his attitude is stiff and he avoids looking into their eyes. Liu Qingge extends an arm with the two fans as he waits for them to accept it. And they do, of course.</p><p>"It's nice," they reply at the same time.</p><p>"Thank you, shidi," Shen Jiu has the gall to put his arm through Liu Qingge's and rest his head on his shoulder.</p><p>Shen Yuan frowns. And not because he's imitating Shen Jiu, but because his brother's impersonation is very bad. Okay, it's true that he always smiles at Liu Qingge and sometimes gets close to him because he likes to stay around him, but Shen Jiu acts too flirtatious.</p><p>And Shen Yuan is NOT flirting with the War God. He would never dare to do something like that!</p><p>Shen Yuan uses his new fan to separate the two of them.</p><p>"Enough. Liu-shidi, don't abuse my brother." Now he's the overprotective one, right?</p><p>Liu Qingge blushes adorably. It is surprising how a man so serious and with so few words, with the emotional capacity of a stone and who only thinks about fighting and swords, it is so easy to shame.</p><p>"I never...!" He babbles while Shen Jiu covers his smile with the sleeve. Still, they hear him laugh.</p><p>"Don't be like that, Jiu-Ge!" Shen Jiu protests with a mocking voice. "Shidi was just being nice. He has even given us a beautiful gift."</p><p>"A beautiful gift, indeed."</p><p>"We should thank shidi."</p><p>Liu Qingge takes a step back when they turn to look at him.</p><p>"Do you want to eat with us tomorrow?" Shen Yuan proposes.</p><p>"At Bai Zhan Peak..."</p><p>Shen Yuan uses his fan to lightly tap Shen Jiu on the head. When he looks at him, offended, Shen Yuan meets his gaze. <em> Don't be cheeky, </em> he thinks. <em> I know you want to go to Bai Zhan Peak to take advantage of his disciple's food. And kidnap them. This is not how gifts are appreciated! </em></p><p><em> As if you could stop me, </em> Shen Jiu's gaze seems to answer.</p><p>"Fine," Liu Qingge replies, startling both brothers.</p><p>He is smiling. And damn it, his smile is even more adorable. Shen Yuan uses the fan to cover his face and hide his expression. Liu Qingge's existence should be illegal. He is too handsome, kind, and caring.</p><p>"Peak Lords Shen! Peak Lord Liu!"</p><p>The three of them turn when they hear someone calling them. A disciple from Qiong Ding Peak runs towards them with a hasty expression. His voice breaks the tranquility and exchanges their expressions: Shen Jiu wipes his smile to regain his icy expression while Shen Yuan bites his lip with nervousness.</p><p>Yue Qingyuan still hasn't decided what will happen to him.</p><p>"Shizun needs you at Qiong Ding Peak. Right now."</p><p>Liu Qingge and Shen Jiu draw their swords at the same time. Although his brother gives him a questioning look, Shen Yuan shakes his head to ride on Liu Qingge's sword. For some reason, he feels more comfortable when Liu Qingge takes him to places. Without hesitation, Shen Yuan grabs his shidi's waist from behind. Despite his muscular body, Liu Qingge has a slim waist and is very easy to hug. Although today he is more tense than usual. Perhaps for having made fun of him a few minutes before.</p><p>In less than one incense stick, they reach Qiong Ding Peak. Despite landing on the grass, Shen Yuan is reluctant to let go of Liu Qingge. He no longer hugs him, but unconsciously his hands are still clinging to his outer clothes.</p><p>Shen Jiu blindly trusts that Yue Qingyuan will allow him to stay in the sect, but Shen Yuan has doubts. Nervous, he gulps and finally walks away from Liu Qingge.</p><p>The other Peak Lords are already inside when they arrive. Shang Qinghua runs to his side with an obvious expression of stress that only makes Shen Yuan's guts twist. He knows that Cang Qiong Mountain Sect is not his place. But he is worried that Shen Jiu will be reckless to stay by his side. Or Liu Qingge. But Shen Jiu needs the support of his sect until Shen Yuan resolves the misunderstanding with Luo Binghe.</p><p>However, there is a fourteenth young man surrounded by the Peak Lords. Shen Yuan opens his mouth in confusion, recognizing Gongyi Xiao. His gold clothes are dirty and torn on the sleeves, and he has a scratch on his cheek that is still healing.</p><p>"Gongyi Xiao?" Shen Jiu comments, sharing the same perplexity as him. "What are you doing here?"</p><p>Still, Shen Yuan appreciates that his brother seems happy. He nudges him before the others guess his wayward thoughts.</p><p>"Master Shen. Young Master Shen." The young man bows. "I've come to talk to you. And the sect leader Yue."</p><p>"Please have a seat," Yue Qingyuan asks.</p><p>In recent weeks, he seems to have aged from stress.</p><p>Intrigued, all the Peak Lords head to their sites. This is one of those rare times when no one whispers. And the silence grows until it intertwines with the air.</p><p>"Young Gongyi Xiao arrived today carrying news about Huan Hua Palace. Luo Binghe has revealed his demonic nature and taken control of the sect."</p><p>Liu Qingge frowns as the others speak in uneasy voices. The ones who used to have doubts about Luo Binghe's demonic heritage are the ones who speak the loudest and ask more questions.</p><p>"I don't understand," Shen Jiu comments. His hand grabs Shen Yuan's wrist as if he is afraid that he might disappear. "We haven’t heard of any wedding with the Little Palace Mistress."</p><p>"There has been no wedding, Master Shen." Gongyi Xiao explains. "He has taken the Huan Hua Palace by force."</p><p>The news unleashes a hurricane of hisses and worried voices. As one of the most powerful sects, Huan Hua Palace possesses talented cultivators, fortune, and many defenses, in addition to traps and arrays. Shen Yuan gasps as he remembers when Mobei-Jun spoke to Luo Binghe about the army.</p><p>"Huan Hua Palace has been isolated for a few days and if it weren't for Gongyi Xiao managed to escape, we still wouldn't have found out." Yue Qingyuan intervenes. His expression is serious and he speaks with determination. "Soon, the entire cultivation world will discover that Luo Binghe's demon nature... and his intentions."</p><p>Shen Yuan bows his head. His pulse trembles. He doesn’t want to face Luo Binghe, as he knows how the war will end. And although his heart suspects that Shen Jiu might rival him this time, Luo Binghe doesn't deserve it either.</p><p>Because it's his fault. Not Shen Jiu's for following his words. Not Luo Binghe's for being born. It’s his. Only his. It was Shen Yuan who had the arrogance to try to change the story. But in the end, he has just entangled with inevitable plots.</p><p>"We should announce it now," Shen Jiu comments with determination and ignoring his discomfort. "We will take that advantage from him and be able to unite the other sects and rogue cultivators."</p><p>"We should be careful," Qi Qingqi shakes her head. "Luo Binghe was a disciple of Cang Qiong Mountain Sect. The others could accuse us of being in league with demons."</p><p>"I severed our disciple-master ties."</p><p>"Shen-shixiong, there are rumors that you are both behind the Jinlan City sowers. Or that you are demon twins."</p><p>"Stupid Old Palace Master," Shen Jiu curses. "Still, I think we should seize this opportunity. At least the others will be aware of what kind of threat Luo Binghe is. At worst, we can spread rumors."</p><p>His suggestion is accepted with murmurs and thoughtful expressions. And Shen Yuan feels increasingly uncomfortable and tense. Until he can't take it anymore and gets up.</p><p>"Jiu-Ge, we need to talk. Alone."</p><p>His brother holds his gaze. Then, he finally nods. Shen Jiu gets up as well and the two of them walk outside, but before leaving, he stops at the threshold.</p><p>"This master is indebted to Gongyi Xiao for helping him rescue his brother. As a just reward, Gongyi Xiao can stay at Qing Jing Peak if he wishes."</p><p>Shen Yuan sighs. From his expression, Shen Jiu is thinking of using that opportunity to officially adopt Gongyi Xiao as his new disciple. And since he has left Huan Hua Palace, even though it’s a good idea, his humor prevents him from savoring that moment. Tension is smoke inside his throat, fear tangled in his lungs. Once alone in the gardens of Qiong Ding Peak, Shen Yuan confronts Shen Jiu's icy and almost indifferent grin.</p><p>"We can't face Luo Binghe," he reminds him with a growl. "Unless you intend he merges both realms and destroys all sects. And we have a plan! Luo Binghe is weakened. We can infiltrate and take the sword from him. Shang Qinghua can provide us with the information and Liu-shidi can help us. No one needs to get hurt!"</p><p>But Shen Jiu's expression is heartless and Shen Yuan's pulse quickens.</p><p>"A-Yuan," he begins and uses that tone that already warns that his words will be bitter. "Have you considered what would happen if Luo Binghe is not affected by Xin Mo?"</p><p>Shen Yuan frowns.</p><p>"What are you talking about?"</p><p>"We have assumed that Luo Binghe's mind it’s affected by Xin Mo, but what if he keeps the sword controlled with violence and dual cultivation? He has not razed Huan Hua Palace, he has conquered it. It’s a strategy, A-Yuan, not a violent impulse. Luo Binghe is well aware of what he's doing. "</p><p>"But...!"</p><p>"Luo Binghe is no longer an innocent child, but the monster that the Abyss and I have forged." Shen Jiu closes his eyes and sighs. "There is a fairly high probability that he made all those decisions because he wants to, not because he is forced by a sword."</p><p>Shen Yuan takes a deep breath as he recalls his last encounters with Luo Binghe. And it pains him to admit that perhaps Shen Jiu is right. Luo Binghe lied to him, Luo Binghe kept him locked up. But Luo Binghe also protected him, took care of him. He wants to believe that there is still a bit of his lovable Luo Binghe with his eyes glowing from the illusion within the Demon Lord's heart.</p><p>He raises his head upon hearing Shen Jiu sigh.</p><p>"In the hypothetical case that the sword has controlled his mind, how can we save him?" He snorts. And his voice sounds resigned. He doesn’t believe in that possibility, but he does believe in Shen Yuan and that is why he won’t reject it without valuing it.</p><p>Shen Jiu's appreciation is strange. Sometimes cold and distant, sometimes it seems like he doesn't have a heart, but he cares for him and listens to him even if they don't think the same.</p><p>"I had thought of self-destruction."</p><p>"What?" Shen Jiu's eyes widen in panic. "Don't even think about doing it, A-Yuan! Or I'll resurrect you to kill you."</p><p>"Listen to me first! With self-destruction, we can calm excess demonic qi without dual cultivation. And we have alternate bodies, remember? Even if one of us sacrifices, then we will return."</p><p>Shen Jiu listens to him with tight lips and fear in his eyes.</p><p>"No."</p><p>"But..."</p><p>"Luo Binghe is my responsibility. I..." He closes his eyes. "In the one who made the mistake. If Luo Binghe is a threat, I will kill him."</p><p>"But Jiu-Ge!!"</p><p>"But if Luo Binghe is only possessed, I will self-destruct. Understood? Don't do anything reckless." Shen Jiu looks into his eyes. "Promise me, A-Yuan."</p><p>For some reason, Shen Yuan feels a bitter taste in his throat while a chill sinks into his flesh.</p><p>"I promise you."</p><p>It is a promise that hurts, that reeks of fear. Although Shen Jiu smiles, something darkens his gaze. Like a drop of sadness that disappears in a blink of an eye.</p>

<p>
<span>Yue Qingyuan sighs, exhausted and with dark circles under his eyes, while Shen Jiu waits. It has been a long time since they were alone in a room. And although it is long and wide, without the other Peak Lords it turns narrow and suffocating.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Every Peak has its Peak Lord," he begins and the uncertainty in his voice makes Shen Jiu uneasy. "We have always been twelve and we can only abandon our position at the end of our generation. However, your... </span>
<em>
<span>brother </span>
</em>
<span>can stay in Qing Jing Peak as an elder."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu hates that Yue Qingyuan sounds so sad, almost hurt. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But at least this time he hasn't failed him and Shen Jiu takes a deep breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Thank you, Zhangmen-shixiong."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yue Qingyuan grimaces.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“One last thing, shidi.” He says before Shen Jiu heads for the door. "I know you'd rather be called Shen Jiu, but you're still Shen Qingqiu. And now more than ever the Qing generation needs to be united."</span>
</p><p>
<span>He clenches his teeth. The brand owned by the Qiu passed from his skin to his name, as if he still belonged to them. But Shen Jiu hides his slave number. Both names are terrible, but one is more tolerable than the other. Perhaps because </span>
<em>
<span>Shen Qingqiu</span>
</em>
<span> never existed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Outside, everyone else is nervously and impatiently awaiting the verdict. Shen Yuan is between Liu Qingge and Shang Qinghua, although the other Peak Lords are there as well, in addition to Gongyi Xiao and Qing Jing Peak's older disciples. All that support makes Shen Jiu smile, although he hides behind the fan to prevent others from seeing that show of weakness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>If one day he disappeared, nothing would happen. They will take care of Shen Yuan and Shen Yuan will take care of Qing Jing Peak and the sect.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Greet Shen Yuan, the new elder of Qing Jing Peak."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Everyone comes to Shen Yuan and some to Shen Jiu to celebrate. In other circumstances he would have been envious, but not today, not right now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Jiu-Ge," Shen Yuan has approached him without him noticing. "What are you thinking about?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I was right. Gongyi Xiao suits in our elegant green and white uniform much better than that hideous golden thing of Huan Hua Palace."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan tries to snicker, but he fails.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You know?" Shang Qinghua mutters at a certain distance. "When they both laugh I have the feeling that they are planning something bad."</span>
</p><p>
<span>The treacherous Liu Qingge nods. He has his arms crossed and watches them without moving or saying anything, although his grin is softer than usual.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shizun, shizun!" Ning Yingying and Ming Fan exclaim as they approach them. "How should we refer to Shen Yuan?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, a blast goes through the sky.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And the entire sect trembles when the power of an enemy threat hits the wards. Instinctively, Shen Jiu covers Shen Yuan. All of them have put their hands on the hilts of their swords and wait still tense and expectant. Yue Qingyuan leaves the house with sudden movements and a livid face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What's going on?" He demands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I suspect we are under attack," Liu Qingge replies. "I will lead my disciples to the sect gates..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before he can finish speaking, it breaks out in a chorus of howls, screams, and sharp hisses. Demonic energy spreads through the air like miasma and even Shen Jiu trembles.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Luo Binghe," he mutters under his breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Beside him, Shen Yuan has paled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yue Qingyuan's expression darkens, his weariness turned into worry.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Liu-shidi will command Bai Zhan Peak. Qiong Ding Peak, Wan Jian Peak, and Xian Shu Peak will come to support you. Mu-shidi, prepare your disciples. Shen-shidi," he turns to Shen Qingqiu. "You know the enemy we face. We are counting on you."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu nods as his hand grips Shen Yuan's wrist tightly. </span>
<em>
<span>This time you won't take him,</span>
</em>
<span> he silently promises.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Ming Fan, Ning Yingying," he calls out to his disciples as Yue Qingyuan continues to give orders. "Return with Shen Yuan to Qing Jing Peak. Protect him. Gongyi Xiao, with me."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ming Fan and Ning Ying also have emotional ties to Luo Binghe. Shen Jiu wants to believe that the half-demon won't hurt them if they get in his way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Wait, Jiu-Ge!" Shen Yuan stops him by holding his sleeve when he tries to walk away. "Remember..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I know, I know. Stop Xin Mo. Unless he is a cruel and conscious demon."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan gulps, uncomfortable and scared.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Find out what is attacking us. If it is an organized army commanded by Sha Hualing, Mobei-Jun, or Luo Binghe himself, we are in danger. But if they are primitive demons or uncontrolled monsters without being commanded... then it is a trap."</span>
</p><p>
<span>And they separate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu has a bad feeling when he rides on Xiu Ya and flies alongside his martial siblings. Killing Luo Binghe is the simple and effective solution, the one that would solve all of his problems. But something inside him rejects that idea. Perhaps because Shen Yuan would hate him if he did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And being hated by Shen Yuan is terrifying.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu allows the others to move away to organize their disciples as he flies even higher to contemplate the threat. As they feared, hordes of monsters and demons crowd the Cang Qiong Mountain Sect entrance to break down the sect's protections with brute force. </span>
<em>
<span>Damn</span>
</em>
<span>, Shen Jiu thinks. It's not a big army, just loud and annoying. Cang Qiong Mountain Sect is powerful enough to get rid of those monsters, but the city is also in danger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu sends Gongyi Xiao to warn Yue Qingyuan that they must spread their forces in protecting the sect and eradicating all monsters to save normal people. While he flies, Shen Jiu verifies that the horde acts uncontrollably and without being commanded by anyone. </span>
<em>
<span>Shen Yuan is right, it’s a lure.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The cultivators have arrived. They fly like arrows to face the enemy. But Shen Jiu only has eyes for one dressed in white.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shidi, with me! It's a trap!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>And despite the distance, the scandal that rises from a hundred howling throats, Liu Qingge listens to him. And he follows his orders without hesitation.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>"Are you alright shiz ... Shen Yuan?" Ning Yingying corrects herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She has taken him to Qing Jing Peak since he still doesn't have his own sword. Shen Yuan tries to smile to reassure her, but the truth is that he is terrified.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This has already happened in the book. Luo Binghe dragged Cang Qiong Mountain Sect. He destroyed the Lingxi Caves, reduced the twelve peaks to ash. He murdered everyone except his wives. Although Shen Yuan tries to remember that this time Liu Qingge is alive, Shen Jiu is supported by everyone, and Yue Qingyuan is still one of the most powerful cultivators, the fear doesn’t fade away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Let's get everyone together just in case," he says with the confidence of being Shen Qingqiu the last few years.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Taking action allows him to distract himself from these dire thoughts. Shen Yuan gathers all of his disciples and divides them into groups so that the smallest and swordless are protected by the seniors.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan's footsteps wobble and his legs stop supporting him. Fortunately, Ning Yingying is nearby and catches him before he falls to the ground.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What's wrong? You look pale."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I think I've got dizzy..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Or maybe it's nerves and fear, freezing his bones.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ning Yingying helps him walk to the bamboo house and Shen Yuan sits down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Should I call someone from Qian Cao Peak?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It's not safe. We should stay together." Shen Yuan takes a deep breath. "Besides, I think I feel better. It must have been just fainting."</span>
</p><p>
<span>But it's a lie. It is not the physical exhaustion that keeps him immobile, but those long chapters on destruction and torture. Yue Qingyuan was pierced by so many arrows that all of his bones were destroyed. Ming Fan was eaten alive by ants. Ning Yingying was reduced to one more flower in an immense harem. Shen Qingqiu...</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan takes a deep breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His Luo Binghe is different from the one in the book, but his latest actions contradict what he had believed. But despite everything, Luo Binghe is still his disciple, his favorite protagonist. And neither does he want Luo Binghe to hurt anyone or anyone to hurt him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In the end, Shen Yuan sends Ning Yingying to supervise the others while he makes himself some tea to relax.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shizun."</span>
</p><p>
<span>He freezes upon hearing that purr that repeats his name. Shen Yuan turns slowly, very slowly. Luo Binghe is in the center of the bamboo house. Unlike last time, now his red sigil shines on his forehead and his clothes are more ostentatious. It is PIDW's dark Luo Binghe, the one he feared and is now here and...</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan takes a step back, terrified, and Luo Binghe's expression darkens.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shizun trusted this disciple, but now he is afraid. What kind of lies has the other shizun told you? Or was that Gongyi Xiao?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan tries to control his racing pulse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Weren't you the one who lied to me, Luo Binghe?" He manages to sputter. "Why? You told me that no one wanted to visit me, but Liu-shidi tried. You never told me why you were organizing your army and now you attack my sect."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I was just trying to protect shizun."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"And now?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe doesn't reply. A dark aura envelops him, it is subtle, almost priceless and Shen Yuan had not noticed at first, but now it is impossible to ignore. </span>
<em>
<span>Xin Mo! </span>
</em>
<span>He understands with horror.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Luo Binghe, listen to me. You have to get rid of that sword. It's getting into your mind..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Luo Binghe grips the hilt even tighter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shizun, I've come for you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And he extends a hand that Shen Yuan cannot accept. Luo Binghe sighs, more sad and resigned than furious. And then tiredness spreads through Shen Yuan's body again. Luo Binghe catches him in his arms before he collapses. Neither his legs nor arms react when Luo Binghe carries him in bridal style.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Luo Binghe, are you using your blood?" He babbles.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And it hurts. It hurts that he doesn't listen to him and uses against him a weapon that Shen Yuan accepted because he trusted Luo Binghe. He carries Shen Yuan outside the bamboo house. He appreciates that his eyes are glassy and can notice his scrambled qi. His qi is like bites, like a rough sea. Shen Yuan wants to calm him down, but he is trapped inside his own body.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe stops near the bamboo forest, hidden enough for others to not see them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I thought the other shizun would be with you..." He mutters to himself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"He is not here!" Shen Yuan hastily spluttered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then Liu Qingge arrives.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge lands with a thud in front of them. Cheng Luan glows unsheathed in his hand and his expression is a mask of rage.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Let him go, demon."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still holding Shen Yuan, Luo Binghe unsheathes Xin Mo. The sword is covered in dark, sticky shadows like cobwebs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Never."</span>
</p><p>
<span>And he throws a wave of demonic qi towards Liu Qingge, so intense that it rips through the bamboo and the disciples scream upon hearing the noise. Liu Qingge manages to stand, protected behind his sword, but he has gritted his teeth in a painful grimace. Still, he charges against Luo Binghe, who uses his energy to keep the cultivator away from them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Cheng Luan traces silver grooves when striking demon qi, but Luo Binghe's power is a wall that resists all attacks. Shen Yuan is so close to him that he can feel his breathing increasingly hard, how his eyes fog up with the color of blood. Luo Binghe is losing his control and he can only watch as he falls apart without doing anything to prevent it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Beast! Get away from my brother!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a graceful bow, Xiu Ya blocks an attack that would have struck Liu Qingge. Shen Jiu lands in front of them, pale, worried, and so furious that he's almost scarier than the Demon Lord.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You have finally arrived, shizun!" Luo Binghe flashes a wild smile that shows all of his teeth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I remind you that I severed our ties between disciple and master."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Did you do it at the Huan Hua Palace or during the Alliance Conference?" Luo Binghe sounds desperate and Shen Yuan weakly complains when he holds him even more tightly. "Why, shizun? Why did you push me? What did I do wrong?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu doesn't reply. He cannot answer. In his place, he raises the arm that holds the sword.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shidi, step aside. I'll take care of it."</span>
</p><p>
<span>That means self-destruction. That means killing Luo Binghe. And Shen Yuan cannot allow either option.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Wait, Jiu-Ge!" He yells before looking at Luo Binghe. "Binghe, please. Calm down. I can explain it to you."</span>
</p><p>
<span>The pressure of qi doesn’t soften. It is so intense that Shen Yuan would also not be able to move, even if he was free of the blood parasites.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It was my fault. I was the reason you ended up at the Endless Abyss."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Regrets are worse than fear. Shen Yuan has endured them for too many days. During the Water Prison, fear froze his tongue, but none of them deserves a lie or a half-truth, no one deserves to suffer the consequences of his actions.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This master always knew that his disciple was a half-demon," he explains under Luo Binghe's confused gaze and Shen Jiu's worried gaze. The two cultivators are tense behind the wall of qi as they try to ignore the darkness that envelops them like a second skin. "Do you believe in destiny, Luo Binghe? Your destiny has always been brilliant..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>No, that's another lie. Luo Binghe's destiny was to suffer and become a monster that makes others suffer without ever finding his true happiness. Shen Yuan takes a deep breath to forget the book and the character. The Luo Binghe that keeps him trapped is real and he deserves an explanation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Your destiny was to end up in the Endless Abyss and reclaim your true power. We knew it. So we tried to prepare you as best as possible so that you would overcome all obstacles and return to us safe and sound. But... I'm sorry, Binghe." His voice breaks. "I was wrong. I thought Shen Jiu knew you were a half-demon, but when he found out he was scared. He believed that I had tricked him. But I never wanted anyone to get hurt..." Shen Yuan has started to cry but he keeps talking. "We prepare your qiankun pouch together and..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>A hand brushes his cheek to wipe his tears. And Shen Yuan discovers that he can move now and is not the only one crying.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shizun, I’m sorry...”</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It's okay, Binghe. It's okay. Don't let it suppress your heart." Shen Yuan moves to comfort him with a hug. But even though the anger has subsided, his qi remains out of control and dangerous. "Everything that's happened in the past, I'll repay it all for you today."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"A-YUAN NO!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan smiles before looking at Shen Jiu one last time. Although his figure is blurred by the shadows of qi, he can recognize his expression of horror.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"See you soon, Jiu-Ge."</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Shen Yuan self-destructs.</span>

<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Planning this fic, I considered the deaths of both Shen (what would have happened if Shen Jiu actually died or kept Shen Yuan's canon sacrifice). In the end, I chose Shen Yuan, because Shen Jiu believes that he is already fine just because he trusts one person, because he thinks he is loved by one person... But the truth is that there are many traumas and many toxic thoughts that need to be cured. And the absence of Shen Yuan will also mark the arcs of Luo Binghe and Liu Qingge.<br/>Furthermore, it is a nice parallel with the beginning of the fic: the story begins with Shen Yuan desperate to live and Shen Jiu terrified that someone will replace him.</p><p>Also, Luo Binghe deserves a genuine apology 😤 I'm changing Shen Yuan's arc in order to better develop his future romantic relationships.</p><p>The third part of the fic is the angst.

<p>Chapter Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p><b>Warning about the third part:</b> Shen Jiu is not fine. He has dragged on many problems since the beginning of the story that at no time has been fixed or cured, but he has ignored it believing that he was already well thanks to the presence of Shen Yuan. But he is not. The third part begins with him and his abandonment and insomnia problems, his grief disorder (first stage: denial), his distrust, anger, insecurity, loneliness, and detachment; his self-destructive and almost suicidal attitude.

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The demonic qi unravels into threads until it fades.</p><p>Liu Qingge and Luo Binghe share the same horror that freezes them, the same disbelief in their wide eyes. And Shen Jiu runs.</p><p>
<em> No. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Nononononoononononononononononoonononononnnnnnnnnonoonononononoononononononoonononononoononononoonononononoonononononoononono </em>
</p><p>
<em> NO! </em>
</p><p>Shen Jiu clings to his brother's body, pulling him away from Luo Binghe's arms, too stunned to react. But he was late. Although Shen Jiu hugs Shen Yuan tightly so that he never disappears, he only catches silence.</p><p>The silence of a heart that doesn’t beat, the silence of interrupted breathing. The silence of a voice that no longer sounds.</p><p>
<em> NONONONONONONOONONONONOONONONOONONONONOONONONONO </em>
</p><p>
<em> Please don’t leave me. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Not again. </em>
</p><p>Shen Jiu collapses onto his knees. All his strength, all his will, have been erased by a weariness that comes from his deepest memories. He doesn't even listen to Liu Qingge's screams or the insults he dedicates to Luo Binghe. Shen Jiu just contemplates Shen Yuan. His body is still warm and he seems to be sleeping, but it's a lie. He is gone. And it's ironic because at first Shen Jiu hated him, Shen Jiu hated that he had tried to steal his life, but in the end…</p><p>
<em> Come back. Please. I had forgotten what it was to trust someone. You've made me feel less miserable. Happy. You have to come back because you are my brother... </em>
</p><p>Shen Jiu closes his eyes to hide all the tears.</p><p>
<em> Nothing has happened. It's okay. Because you will come back. </em>
</p><p>After all, that was never Shen Yuan's true body. Shen Yuan has another body buried underground. He is not dead. He will return.</p><p>And Shen Jiu is used to waiting.</p><p>Shen Jiu stands up with Shen Yuan in his arms. Although his body is light, as if he has bird bones, Shen Jiu walks slowly. All his fears weigh too much and crush him. Shen Jiu raises his head and discovers Liu Qingge pointing Cheng Luan at Luo Binghe’s neck, undecided whether to kill him or not, while the disciples stay away. The scandal must have attracted them, but none dares to approach.</p><p>"Stop," Shen Jiu orders in a voice that is too hoarse, too broken. "You are embarrassing A-Yuan."</p><p>Liu Qingge lowers his sword and looks at him and then finally reality hits him as tears cover the War God's eyes.</p><p>"I'm sorry... I've failed you both," he splutters.</p><p>"It's okay, shidi. It's okay."</p><p>But his words, instead of reassuring him, worry Liu Qingge even more.</p><p>Shen Jiu has arrived with the two and stands between them.</p><p>"It's temporary," he tries to explain before either of them does something stupid. "Shen Yuan will be back. And now we should fix this mess. You." Shen Jiu looks at Luo Binghe. "Take away your demons. And I hope you assume the consequences of everything you've destroyed. And you." He turns to Liu Qingge. "Call Shang-shidi. My Peak needs some repairs."</p><p>But Liu Qingge remains paralyzed and horrified. Although he opens his mouth, he cannot speak. Only Luo Binghe seems to react to his words. The Demon Lord uses his sword to cut through a portal in midair.</p><p>Shen Jiu closes his eyes. He still feels a knot of emotions inside his chest, stretching and stretching and stretching and about to break him. But he is used to pain and will endure it. First, he has to reassure Luo Binghe before his qi alters again and Liu Qingge’s denial. And explain to the other Peak Lords that Shen Yuan has a spare body.</p><p>Everything is fine.</p><p>Although he's tired and just wants to stay alone and close his eyes and sleep until Shen Yuan comes back and…</p><p>Someone grabs him by the waist.</p><p>"STAY AWAY FROM HIM, DEMON!"</p><p>Luo Binghe drags Shen Jiu and Shen Yuan with him. The portal closes and the last Shen Jiu hears is Liu Qingge's voice calling out his name. The echo of his desperate cry, the bamboo, and his house; the terrified gazes from his disciples, and the familiar smell of Qing Jing Peak have all disappeared.</p><p>Shen Jiu blinks. At first, he doesn't recognize where he is. In a very short time, Luo Binghe has refurbished the Huan Hua Palace. Gold has been replaced by red and black. Human and demon servants approach them. Restless, Shen Jiu hugs Shen Yuan's body tighter, but the Demon Lord approaches them and takes him away with gentle, but firm intentions.</p><p>"Don't worry, shizun. I'll bring shizun back," the demon assures him with a confidence bordering on insanity.</p><p>In his arms, Shen Yuan seems more fragile and delicate. Luo Binghe turns his back on Shen Jiu as he orders his servants.</p><p>"Bring me Mobei-Jun. Take shizun to his room."</p><p>Shen Jiu could stop him, stop Luo Binghe from leaving with Shen Yuan.</p><p>But he doesn’t.</p><p>Instead, Shen Jiu allows the servants to guide him to a room. It is light and airy, exquisitely decorated, and reminds him of his bamboo house. <em> This is where you wanted to bring A-Yuan? </em> He thinks as he examines the furniture.</p><p>There is something wrong. Shen Jiu at first believed that Luo Binghe kept his brother locked up because he mistook them, later he discovered that the Demon Lord had always recognized them. Shen Jiu understands hatred and resentment, he has spent a lifetime feeding on them. But the adoration that Luo Binghe seems to process for his brother is incomprehensible to him. </p><p>It seems like something else. Something very different from the respect between teacher and student. <em> But A-Yuan told me that he is only interested in women </em>... Shen Jiu begins to have a bad feeling in his chest. But there is nothing he can do at that moment.</p><p>In the end, Shen Jiu sits under the window. No matter the place, waiting is always just as terrible. And now it's the only thing he can do.</p><p>So, Shen Jiu waits.</p><p>Despite the quiet of the room, there is chaos on the other side of the walls. When Shen Jiu sits up to find out what's going on, he discovers that there are guards at his door and they won't let him out. Resigned, he returns to his place under the window.</p><p>At least the views are nice.</p><p>Some maids come in to bring him a tray of food. But he is not hungry. The food is cold and intact when they return at night with another tray.</p><p>When he was a child trapped in the Qiu mansion, waiting for Qi-Ge was agonizing. Time slipped by very slowly and he was aware of every minute, every hour, every day that it was digging into his flesh. However, waiting for Shen Yuan is more blurry. Soon it dawns. They bring him breakfast, they prepare a bath that he ignores. More chaotic noises and the whispering voices of the servants are heard. It's noon. It’s sunset. It’s night. It is dawn. It's noon. It’s sunset. It’s night. It’s dawn. It's noon...</p><p>The door opens.</p><p>And Mu Qingfang enters the room.</p><p>"Mu-shidi?" Shen Jiu gets up, confused. "What are you doing here?"</p><p>His martial brother sighs. He looks exhausted.</p><p>"Your disciple appeared at Qian Cao Peak and... I'm sorry, Shen-shixiong. I'm so sorry." Mu Qingfang wrings his hands nervously. "I know this is a tough time for you, but you need to talk to Luo Binghe. He is insane. He has asked me to... heal Shen-ershixiong."</p><p>Shen Jiu frowns.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"He believes that he can resurrect him."</p><p>"That is not possible. Besides, it is absurd." Shen Jiu clicks his tongue as he shakes his head.</p><p>"Grief is tough, but he doesn't listen to me. Please, you have to talk to him..."</p><p>Shen Jiu interrupts him before pulling a talisman of silence from his sleeve.</p><p>"Shen Yuan is not dead," he explains to Mu Qingfang after making sure that no one can hear him.</p><p>However, his martial brother adopts the same expression of horror and pity as Liu Qingge. Mu Qingfang reaches out to take his hands while speaking to him in a cautious voice.</p><p>"He is gone, shixiong."</p><p>"No, he is not..."</p><p>"I have seen his body. I can help Luo Binghe preserve it, but his soul has gone to the reincarnation circle."</p><p>"No!" Shen Jiu slaps him away. "Can you hear me for once! Shen Yuan is alive. We looked for Sun and Moon Dew Flower seeds."</p><p>"Sun and Moon Dew Flower seeds?"</p><p>"Yes. With those seeds, you can plant another body using qi. A-Yuan's soul has only changed body."</p><p>Mu Qingfang's expression darkens.</p><p>"I've never heard of something like this. Where did you get that information?"</p><p>"A-Yuan told me about it. I think he read it in a book."</p><p>"What book? From the Qing Jing Peak bookstore?"</p><p>"Perhaps..."</p><p>"A book that you haven't read?" He sighs. "Where did you get those seeds?"</p><p>"Here. In the Bailu Forest."</p><p>"So you also planted a body?"</p><p>"No..."</p><p>"Do you at least know where Shen Yuan's body is?"</p><p>He tried so hard to prevent his brother from discovering his lie that he never inquired into those details.</p><p>Mu Qingfang's expression becomes more skeptical at his silence. Shen Jiu notices that his heart trembles, that he is drowning.</p><p>"You don't believe me," he splutters with wide eyes.</p><p>Shen Jiu takes a step back and Mu Qingfang raises his hands while looking into his eyes.</p><p>"I’m trying, Shen-shixiong. But it sounds like a tale that your mind has made up to reject reality. The first step in grief is to accept that he is gone..."</p><p>Mu Qingfang looks at him with pity and Shen Jiu hates him.</p><p>The healer walks over to the table and examines the cold, untouched food. Then he stares at the wrinkle-free bed until he stops at his disheveled appearance.</p><p>"When was the last time you ate, Shen-shixiong?"</p><p>"I’m an immortal master. I can practice inedia."</p><p>"When was the last time you slept?"</p><p>Shen Jiu frowns.</p><p>"Does it matter? I'm fine." But he is not fine. He is furious, exhausted, and doesn't need Mu Qingfang's voice to cast new doubts in his head. "I trust A-Yuan. He will come back."</p><p>"Shen-shixiong..."</p><p>He hates the wariness with which Mu Qingfang tries to approach him as if he is not a person, but a wounded and confused animal. Shen Jiu shakes his sleeves to prevent him from touching him.</p><p>"I'm telling the truth! But you never believe me!"</p><p>Because he is Shen Jiu.</p><p>And people only trust Shen Yuan, they only care about Shen Yuan, they only believe in Shen Yuan. It’s normal. He does the same. He doesn't trust himself, he doesn't care about himself, he doesn't believe in himself either.</p><p>But he is tired of always facing the misgivings of others. The rumors, the misunderstandings. Why try if they despise him?</p><p>"Leave me alone," he hisses angrily.</p><p>Shen Jiu only breathes in relief when the door closes. Although the knot in his chest is still inside, stretching and stretching, twisting all that resentment accumulated over time, all those wounds that have never healed.</p><p>He returns to his place under the window.</p><p>And he waits.</p>

<p>
<span>The next few days happened in a blur.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu hears from the servants that Mu Qingfang and Luo Binghe have locked themselves in a room to </span>
<em>
<span>heal </span>
</em>
<span>Shen Yuan. The room is covered with frost to preserve the body and protect it from decomposition. Luo Binghe only leaves under specific circumstances.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That means Shen Jiu can calmly wait undisturbed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>However, since Mu Qingfang's visit, the servants insist that he must eat. "These are Lord Luo's orders," the humans say. "These are Jushang's orders," said the demons. Thus, Shen Qingqiu stirs the food and drinks so they stop bothering him. At night, he also undoes the sheets, although he doesn’t dare to close his eyes, fearing the nightmares.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The servants also pester him with the baths and Shen Jiu reluctantly agrees. They bring him new clothes, green and white, albeit with black or red decorations. Although they are different clothes than he usually wears, Shen Jiu is indifferent and he allows them to comb and dress him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>One morning the servants announce that he can now leave the room. Even so, most of the palace is off-limits. "Jushang is reforming it," the servants explain with great enthusiasm. The corridors that Shen Jiu can walk through are hardly reminiscent of the originals of the Huan Hua Palace. Luo Binghe has chosen a new undoubtedly demonic aesthetic and from the servants' comments, Shen Jiu deduces that he also wants to make the palace bigger. </span>
<em>
<span>Why?</span>
</em>
<span> He thinks.</span>
<em>
<span> For your infinite harem?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Even so, he notices a bit of fear as he understands Luo Binghe's clear intentions to become the emperor of Shen Yuan's prophecies.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu is only allowed to stay in a specific spot in the gardens. Although it is nice to feel the sun on his face, there is no difference between waiting inside a room or outside. The anguish is always the same and also the fatigue that dulls his thoughts and blurs the hours.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eight days have passed since Shen Yuan's death when something changes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu is sitting under a gazebo when he hears noises. The scandal is annoying but common in the palace. Shen Jiu has never given importance to it. Perhaps it is the reforms or the old disciples of the sect rebelling against the demons. But that day the servants around him tense up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And a cultivator dressed in white appears.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu frowns, confused and stunned. Liu Qingge seems to be part of a dream. There is something unreal about him, how he opens his eyes when he recognizes him and runs towards the gazebo. Shen Jiu still hasn’t assimilated what is happening when he is caught in a hug.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge is trembling, he realizes. Liu Qingge is here and is real. His body is warm and until now Shen Jiu hadn't realized how painful loneliness is. Unconsciously, he lifts his hands to sink them into the folds of his robes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shidi?" He mutters, stunned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge moves without breaking the hug until his forehead brushes his. And a hand caresses Shen Jiu's cheek as if he is something precious.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I finally found you," Liu Qingge manages to say in a broken voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Wait? What are you doing here?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Rescue you."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge stands up, still holding Shen Jiu. And he stumbles, leaning on his shidi's chest. He can feel that Liu Qingge is tense, almost ready to fight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don't you dare," the servants hiss in a warning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Liu Qingge dares.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu is still confused when Liu Qingge grabs his hand to flee. However, exhaustion makes him clumsy and Shen Jiu falls to the ground. But Liu Qingge doesn’t abandon him. He reaches down and gently carries him into his arms while someone yells.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge runs through the gardens and no one tries to stop him. Shen Jiu closes his eyes and grabs onto his neck. All seems part of a dream. Perhaps he is sleeping or perhaps exhaustion has made him sink into one of those desperate desires deep in his heart.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Some guards try to stop him, but no one confronts him and Liu Qingge dodges them until he reaches the walls. Opening his eyes, Shen Jiu recognizes signs of recent fighting and for the first time, he wonders if these marks are from when Luo Binghe conquered Huan Hua Palace or was Liu Qingge trying to enter all this time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We need to reach outside Bailu Forest," Liu Qingge warns him when they finally reach the trees. "There is a formation that prevents flying." He grips Shen Jiu tighter. "I'll take you to Cang Qiong Mountain Sect and then rescue Mu-shixiong and Shen Yuan. I promise you. I won’t abandon your brother’s body so you can bury him."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Despite his characteristic confidence, there is sadness in his voice. And Shen Jiu sees that Liu Qingge looks extremely tired. Maybe he's not the only one who hasn't slept all that time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They enter the interior of the forest when a dark rift splits the air. And Luo Binghe appears, with Xin Mo in hand, his gaze glowing red and rage. Liu Qingge stops and the two silently challenge each other.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Let shizun go," the demon demands, speaking very slowly. And although he seems calm, his posture is threatening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge growls, furious.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You don’t have enough!!?" He hisses, releasing Shen Jiu so that he can stand while Liu Qingge reaches for Cheng Luan's hilt. "Shen Yuan died because of you! And now you want...!!?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before he can finish speaking, dark, demonic, and dense qi covers Luo Binghe's figure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"SHUT UP!!!!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>A wave of demonic qi rushes down on them. Liu Qingge covers Shen Jiu with his body before attacking the demon as well. Soon, both swords collide, engulfed in black and silver sparks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The strength of both qi knocks Shen Jiu to the ground. And he is unable to get up. There is something that keeps him paralyzed, that freezes his legs, his energy. Maybe it's tiredness. Or maybe it's the confusion of watching them fight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although their styles are very different, there is a certain similarity that makes them reflections. They have the same look, the same pain warped in rage.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I never meant to hurt shizun!" Luo Binghe roars and sounds lamenting, crying.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"He would be alive if he weren't for you!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu's eyes widen after he understands... their heartbreak is evident. </span>
<em>
<span>They love him! </span>
</em>
<span>Shen Jiu remembers Luo Binghe carrying Shen Yuan in his arms to take him away from the sect, Liu Qingge's strange changes in his attitude that became more apparent after the succubus mission. They love Shen Yuan or, at least, they want Shen Yuan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu notices a bitter taste. None of them have called him by his name. Because Shen Yuan is gone and there is still someone identical to him. The discomfort grows when he remembers that Luo Binghe has locked him in the room that was going to be for Shen Yuan as if he was some kind of replacement.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>How could I have been such an idiot? </span>
</em>
<span>He thinks as he gets up. </span>
<em>
<span>Surely Liu Qingge hasn't even come for me, but A-Yuan.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu intervenes in the fight. He needs to stop them before Luo Binghe gets out of control and Shen Yuan's sacrifice has been in vain. But he has forgotten Xiu Ya in the room and his qi fails when he raises his hands to stop their swords.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shizun!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Move away!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Cheng Luan scratches his left arm, tearing his sleeves and staining the ground with blood while demonic qi strikes him. Even though it’s not an especially powerful blow, Shen Jiu doubles over coughing up blood.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Enraged, Luo Binghe unleashes his energy and attacks Liu Qingge. The air churns with violence and murderous intent. Shen Jiu closes his eyes before putting his hands on the ground and trying to get up. But his injured arm burns and he can't move. Although Liu Qingge doesn't scream, he does hear him groan in pain before a blow shakes the forest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Stop..." Shen Jiu tries to sputter. “Don’t… hurt him.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe returns to his side. The demonic qi softens as he reaches down and gently picks him up. Shen Jiu thinks back to the last time when he did the same to Shen Yuan, and panic ripped through his body.</span>
<em>
<span> I'm not him. I'M NOT HIM.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>But he is too tired and he cannot struggle or open his mouth to speak.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu's pulse is racing as he looks for Liu Qingge. And he breathes in relief when he discovers that he is hurt but alive. Liu Qingge uses Cheng Luan to get up. He has blood on his face and from the way he is holding his chest, perhaps also several broken ribs. Luo Binghe gives him a last look.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I won't kill you because Shizun appreciates you. But the next time you try to attack my palace, I won't be so merciful." A cruel smile appears on his lips. "Maybe I'll rip your arm off."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe turns around and leaves with Shen Jiu back to the palace. It is the first time that they are alone since the Alliance Conference and the silence grows like a shadow. Shen Jiu no longer understands what his former disciple wants from him: revenge, a replacement...</span>
</p><p>
<span>The same servants and guards who haven’t dared to confront Liu Qingge, receive their Demon Lord with bows. </span>
<em>
<span>Cowards</span>
</em>
<span>, Shen Jiu hisses with narrowed eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Call the healer," Luo Binghe orders them. He has stopped for a few seconds in front of his servants and then continues walking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The room is cold when they arrive, although there is no frost on its walls or a frozen corpse, just an empty bed and a closed window. Luo Binghe carries Shen Jiu and helps him sit on the edge of the mattress. Although his movements are careful and avoid brushing against his wound, Shen Jiu recognizes that he is tense. Shen Yuan tried to clarify what happened, however, there is much that they haven’t talked about yet and all those silent words create an abyss between them. Luo Binghe is so close that his curls brush his cheek, but Shen Jiu feels that he is so far away that he won’t be able to hear him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mu Qingfang arrives quickly, disheveled, with his sleeves rolled up and the exhaustion drawing dark circles under his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What happened?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"An accident."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu purses his lips and looks at the wall as Mu Qingfang stands in front of him to examine the wound. His shidi's skin is icy, but his movements are more precise than Luo Binghe's and he manages to move his arm without hurting him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It's superficial. Bring me water. I need to disinfect the wound." He pauses. "I would also appreciate having access to the salves and medicines of your palace."</span>
</p><p>
<span>In other circumstances, perhaps Shen Jiu would have smiled at the image of the lanky healer commanding the Demon Lord. And the most amused is that Luo Binghe abides without question. When he leaves the room, Shen Jiu inhales, discovering that until that moment he had been holding his breath. However, Mu Qingfang's presence also makes him uncomfortable, reminding him of the misgivings of their last argument.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe returns followed by more servants who are placed under Mu Qingfang's command. Although the Demon Lord remains distant, he doesn’t leave and watches closely as Mu Qingfang cleans the wound and bandages his arm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu tries to pull away when the healer finishes, however, Mu Qingfang grabs his wrist to check his meridians. Although he's trying his best to ignore them all, he notices his throat dry when his shidi frowns. There is a concern in his eyes and even Luo Binghe notices, as he leaves the wall he was leaning against and approaches them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What's wrong?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mu Qingfang ignores the Demon Lord, his gaze fixed on Shen Jiu's.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shen-shixiong, your qi is unstable."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Annoyed, Shen Jiu manages to free himself as he clicks his tongue.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I've been hit by demonic qi. I'll recover with a little meditation..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Your physical state is fragile because you still don't eat or sleep, am I wrong?" Mu Qingfang interrupts him. He is no longer tired but disappointed. "You have a superficial wound, but you have bled too much because you have no energy to heal it yourself. And now your qi is altered. You have always been prone to qi deviations, Shen-shixiong."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You're overreacting."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I'm not and you know it. Our mental state affects the qi and now you are under a lot of stress."</span>
</p><p>
<span>At least this time Mu Qinfgang hasn't mentioned the forbidden words: grief, denial, and Shen Yuan's death.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You're right: I need to rest." Shen Qingqiu flashes a fake smile that accompanies his bitter words. "Can you please leave me alone?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>He stiffens, holding his breath, after seeing Mu Qingfang sit up and look at Luo Binghe. It's not a "Let's go back with Shen Yuan" look, but a "We need to talk" look. That complicity keeps him alert and suspicious. </span>
<em>
<span>Do you trust Luo Binghe more than me? That superb demon who has locked us both up? </span>
</em>
<span>He wants to yell at him, but he clenches his teeth until his jaw hurts. </span>
<em>
<span>Do you know that he has hurt Liu Qingge? And we still do not know what happened to the Old Palace Master and his daughter…</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Although the door closes, Shen Jiu still feels all those thoughts inside his chest, poisonous like smoke. To distract himself, he picks up the little chaos and changes his robes. He also folds the torn and bloody clothes. When the servants arrive, they take them away along with the sheets that have also been stained when Mu Qingfang cleaned the wound.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That night, Luo Binghe returns with a tray of food. That change in an invariable routine makes him suspicious. Shen Jiu watches as Luo Binghe puts the tray on the table and sits down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shizun." It is the first time since Shen Yuan's death that Luo Binghe has spoken to him directly and his voice makes him tremble. "Would you humor me?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Suspicious, Shen Jiu crosses his arms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Is this Mu Qingfang's idea?" He guesses, raising an eyebrow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>However, Luo Binghe tilts his head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Did shizun forget the bet?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu frowns until the memories return with little bites. The sword. The shards. A bet that he knew he was going to win. But now the reward is indifferent to him, although something inside him (hunger, maybe regrets) twists. Shen Jiu approaches the table with small steps and sits down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The food is simple, a little white rice with almost no seasonings, and apricots. Still, it smells as good as ever. Nostalgia catches him with the first bite. The food tastes like the old days at Qing Jing Peak, Liu Qingge kicking open the door and Luo Binghe trying to stop him in vain; Shen Yuan covering his hand with a sleeve to hide his laughter and the unfriendly cat climbing up on the table to steal something from the plat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But everything has changed forever. And those sunny days, without worries or long waits, will never return.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu eats silently, avoiding Luo Binghe's gaze. And he doesn't speak either. The weak smile with which he has reminded him the bet has faded, replaced by a thoughtful grin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Mu-shishu has made this special herbal tea," he explains as he hands him a cup of tea. "It will help shizun to sleep."</span>
</p><p>
<span>After a doubt, he accepts.</span>

<p>
<span>In the dark, the room becomes the same as his bamboo house. Shen Jiu is so tired that he closes his eyes and tries to fool himself. At first, he succeeds. He takes a deep breath as his thoughts fly away. But the pressure in his chest doesn't fade.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>shen yuan is missing liu qingge is hurt liu qingge and luo binghe are in love with shen yuan will liu qingge be alright? will he return? shen yuan please come back soon what are mu qingfang and luo binghe planning? what does luo binghe want? do you hate me? why don't you hate me??????????</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu exhales, opening his eyes. The room is too cold and it doesn't smell like bamboo, but strangers and medicines. And there is no one else. Just him and different fatigue than usual. Shen Jiu rubs his eyes. </span>
<em>
<span>Damn tea</span>
</em>
<span>, he hisses. He had become used to sleepless nights, but now his determination begins to bubble away. Reluctantly, Shen Jiu takes off his clothes and lies down on the bed. He doesn't want to sleep. He is afraid to sleep. But the effect of the narcotic is too intense and defeats insomnia.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu feels that he is sinking into a deep black water lake, which erases all his worries.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But the nightmare catches him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The darkness engulfs him. He dreams that he is locked in a room without doors or windows. And the room begins to shrink. It's smaller, smaller, smaller, smaller. The walls crush him, break his bones. Shen Jiu opens his mouth to scream, but sand gets down his throat. It's smaller, smaller, smaller, smaller. Although he tries to close his eyes, he is enveloped by the same thick, sticky darkness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s not a room, it’s a mouth. The walls have teeth and fangs, the floor is a slippery tongue. He is going to be eaten in a thousand pieces.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Someone grabs him. Shen Jiu feels tiny and fragile when some arms wrap around his body and rescue him away from that hissing jaw. A greenish clarity dazzles him. And his lungs relax to find himself under a sky so blue it hurts. Shen Jiu walks among the bamboo with cautious steps.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In the distance, someone says his name.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And he would recognize that voice even at the end of the world.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu runs. And the bamboo sprouts are pushed aside to show a house. Shen Yuan is there, playing with a cat. He is not alone. There are some shadows without faces, Luo Binghe, and his other disciples. Shen Yuan raises his head and looks at him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Jiu-Ge!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>They are almost all there. Someone takes him by the hand and encourages him to approach with increasingly confident steps.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shizun! Shizun!" Luo Binghe says, looking at the two of them with eyes shining like stars. He is an adult now, but he still wears a white and green uniform. "This disciple has improved his sword technique!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh!" Shen Yuan smiles candidly, sitting down on the grass. "Show it."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu sits with him, allowing nostalgia to entangle him, erasing the suffocating memory of the nightmare.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu growls with his eyes closed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The dream is still tangled with his thoughts. Despite the light that has devoured the room, the inside of his head is a hole covered in shadow. Shen Jiu growls again when someone knocks on the door. Someone comes in. Although Shen Jiu opens his eyes, he feels that he is still within an illusion. The servants who enter are more unreal than usual and he is unable to recognize where he is. All the furniture is strange, the sheets are too soft, there is too much noise outside the window.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu covers his face with his hands, still wrapped in the sheets. His body is heavy and awkward, his eyes sting. He feels a doughy tongue and tiredness that cuts through bone and muscle, to wrap itself in his chest, in his skull. </span>
<em>
<span>How long have I been sleeping? </span>
</em>
<span>He thinks as he sits on the bed. Although he wishes to close his eyes and continue sleeping, Shen Jiu slowly begins to wake up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And he remembers that he is not at his house, but at Luo Binghe's palace. Nine days have passed since Shen Yuan's self-destruction and he still hasn't come back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Something inside him squirms. Maybe it's fear. Or doubts. Remorse. Unsafety. Suspicion. Mistrust.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu gazes without enthusiasm at the food that has been brought to him. From the light coming through the window, it must be almost noon. And although he still notices the nauseous echo of the nightmare, he is so exhausted that he just wants to sleep. Sleep for a whole day and wake up when Shen Yuan does.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Suddenly, Shen Jiu's eyes widen. And despite the clumsiness, he pulls the sheets aside and manages to get up. At first, his legs shake. The servants pretend to bring his clothes closer to him, but he ignores them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Where is Luo Binghe?" He hisses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His heart beats so fast that he hears nothing else, just those rhythmic thumps against his ribs. After so many days of waiting, feeling something is immense and terrifying. It burns. It is anger and suspicion and confusion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The servants exchange an uncomfortable look.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Lord Luo is with Master Mu in the frozen room."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Where?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You should eat first, Master Shen. We will tell Lord Luo that you have asked for him..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu growls and walks through them. He ignores their pathetic attempts to stop him, the food on the table, or the fact that he's disheveled and wearing only his inner robes. Shen Jiu leaves his room chased by the voices of the servants. Although he has never visited Shen Yuan's corpse, he senses where he is.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Wait! Master Shen...!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu walks with increasingly impatient and swift steps. Although his legs are still tired and the sudden movement makes him dizzy, he doesn't stop. As he approaches the hallway, several guards try to block him, but he gives them a dismissive look.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Leave."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan's room is nearby. Shen Jiu jerks the door open and enters, ignoring the chill biting into his bare feet or exposed skin. The room is very similar to his, almost a reflection. The walls are covered in frost and one body has been lying on the bed for nine days with its eyes closed. For a few moments, Shen Jiu ignores Mu Qingfang and Luo Binghe's confusion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan seems to be sleeping.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And it hurts because he is not the real one.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What's going on?" Luo Binghe growls. He holds one of Shen Yuan's wrists in his hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The servants stand on the threshold of the door, not daring to enter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We are sorry, Lord Luo."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We tried to stop Master Shen."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"But he doesn't listen to us."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shen-shixiong?" Mu Qingfang turns away from the bed to walk towards him with cautious steps. "It’s something wrong?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>He stops when Shen Jiu gives him an icy, grim look.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Thanks for drugging me, shidi," he hisses, taunting each word sarcastically.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mu Qingfang sighs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It was a medicinal tea to help you sleep, shixiong."</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Shen Jiu no longer listens to him. He turns his head towards Luo Binghe while that storm of emotions continues to burn inside him until flames creep up his throat and his voice crackles.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"How could I forget your Dream Demon?" He growls angrily.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe's expression darkens.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Does Shizun also know about the Elder Demon?" Still, he has the nerve to smile. "I shouldn't have underestimated shizun's knowledge."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu is trembling. And he notices a bitter taste in his mouth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"How long?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This is the second nightmare this humble disciple has intervened in."</span>
</p><p>
<span>And he remembers it. Another horrible dream that only disappeared when someone rescued him with a hug. It was the night he and Shen Yuan spoke perhaps for the first time as brothers. Shen Jiu clenches his fists.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Liar." He accuses him. "Now I remember. I started to sleep well after that night. But the nightmares returned when I pushed you into the Endless Abyss. I thought it was fear or regrets, but no! It was you all this time!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>With slow and cautious movements, Luo Binghe leaves Shen Yuan's arm on the bed and turns to him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I was just trying to help shizun."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I never gave you permission to get into my head!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu is startled to notice that someone has approached him. Mu Qingfang looks at him with pity and fear. Despite his rage, Shen Jiu manages to retrieve the fragments of his cold mask. And he gives him a dismissive look.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Why do you all forget that I am Shen Qingqiu, Qing Jing Peak Lord, the Xiu Ya sword?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>He is not frail or sick or broken, he is just a little tired and very furious.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Once upon a time, there was a young boy and two shizuns.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although his shizuns were identical, their hearts couldn't be more different. One shizun was warm like the sun and his kindness made the boy happy. The other shizun was cold and strict, and the boy was afraid of him at first. But when the demons attacked them, the cold shizun said: "I trust him."</span>
</p><p>
<span>And everything changed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>If one shizun was his sun, the other was the moon: sometimes he disappeared into the darkness, sometimes he shone, sometimes he smiled, and his smiles were the most unique and beautiful.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The boy worshiped the sun. He made him feel special. Once he accompanied him in his nightmare, healed his wounds, and taught him to face monsters. Even when he fell into the deepest and darkest abyss, his sunlight was there to illuminate his path and warm him on the coldest nights.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But it was the moon who was once hurt to protect them, who trusted him to keep the white cultivator away, who smiled when he cooked and even bet with him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The moon boasted with a smile that he would win. The moon pushed him away with a look of hatred. It was also the moon who broke his heart.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Moonlight didn’t reach the deep and sinister darkness of hell.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The boy was bright, but inside his heart, there was a bit of shade. There was resentment, insecurity, hatred, fear, and longing. The boy who had it all trembled and his light began to dim. Did his moon hate him for being a demon? But the boy believed that humans were the worst. It was the humans who mistreated his mother and left her to die. Why did the moon change his mind? Will the sun also hate him when he discovers the truth?</span>
</p><p>
<span>The boy became an adult.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The disciple became a demon.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And he came back, with twisted ideas and different plans.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He wanted the truth. He wanted to take his sun back. Maybe also the moon. A part of him wanted to return to those happy days when he was loved. That was his first plan. But it was a bad plan. Before he was weak, now he had power. All his dreams came true thanks to sacrifices. Why stop? He could change the world. He could destroy everything he hated and create a little paradise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But all his dreams cost blood.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He has gotten the truth, his sun, and his moon. But his days are still not happy. Now his kind shizun is cold and the cold one is fading.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It has been nine days since the death of one shizun and Luo Binghe has been avoiding the other. He's been suffering doubts and rancor for three years. And all those dark feelings won't fade in the blink of an eye. He still notices them stirring in his chest. </span>
<em>
<span>Why, shizun? Why did you push me? Why did you never try to talk to me when I came back? I'm here. Do you hate me so much? Do I seem so despicable to you?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>But shizun is no longer scary. Unlike Liu Qingge, shizun hasn’t accused him of the death of his brother. And he's still here, he's never tried to run away. Although Luo Binghe still feels that murderous fury and the sword whispers that he should punish him, he is starting to calm down. His heart aches and his inner demons are going to drive him crazy, but his sadness is too immense and dark.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shizun died because of him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And he is afraid of not being able to bring him back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He would love to close his eyes and hug the cold shizun. Cry and scream how much he misses Shen Yuan. And perhaps Shen Jiu would comfort him and promise him that he will return.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Shen Jiu ignores him. And Luo Binghe finally understands that he is not doing it out of evil, but because he is ill.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This disciple apologizes." Luo Binghe takes a step, but that seems to make shizun more nervous, so he stops. "Mu-shishu told me that you weren't eating or sleeping."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I am an immortal Master," he reminds them. But his voice sounds desperate, an echo of the past.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe gives him a conciliatory smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This disciple thought that he could help shizun. But now I understand that it was a mistake. This disciple will not intervene again without shizun's permission." Unless he is suffering. Luo Binghe has learned that he must be more subtle. "But this disciple would be very happy to help shizun. So please, if you need this disciple, ask for it."</span>
</p><p>
<span>His words have calmed Shen Jiu and Luo Binghe approaches him again. His smile disappears as he fixes on the useless servants who don't know how to take care of shizun. Maybe choosing them because of his mediocre appearance was a bad idea. He will have to look for others.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shizun," he whispers to him. "Go to your room. This disciple will accompany you to eat if shizun wishes."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe can see Mu Qingfang nod approvingly. He is not an idiot: he knows that the healer doesn’t approve of his mad and desperate desire to resurrect Shen Yuan. But Luo Binghe doesn't care.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe will fix his two shizuns.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>The nights are still horrible, sometimes plagued with nightmares, sometimes punctuated by insomnia. Shen Jiu usually sleeps during the day. Tiredness devours him when he is waiting in the garden or his room and inadvertently he closes his eyes. Then he wakes up in bed as if someone had carried him in their arms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And time passes. And Shen Yuan doesn’t return.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Neither does Liu Qingge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And although it’s not the first time, it’s not a surprise, Shen Jiu's heart sinks a little further.</span>

<blockquote class="userstuff"><p><b>CURIOSITY #1</b><br/>Yup, Shen Yuan has made the same mistake as SVSSS by confusing Bingbing's intentions 😈😈 I hope that thanks to this chapter, Bingbing's thoughts are clearer now.</p><p><b>CURIOSITY #2</b><br/>I warned you that the nightmare of chapter 14 would be important 😈😈😈😈 </p><p>The arc of the relationship between Luo Binghe and Shen Jiu is about trust/mistrust. Right now, Luo Binghe is confident that Shen Jiu will stay with him (despite his doubts, Shen Jiu hasn't tried to run away and so the vigilance has been relaxed and he has more freedom now). In the previous chapter you asked me if Luo Binghe has given him his blood. No. In this fic, demon blood reflects trust. Shen Yuan accepted because he trusted him (and Luo Binghe later betrayed that trust by attacking the sect and using the blood against him). And that's why Luo Binghe still hasn't offered it to Shen Jiu.</p><p>But Shen Jiu doesn't trust Luo Binghe. And it's ironic, because Luo Binghe is the only one who would trust him blindly right now if he told him the truth about Shen Yuan.</p><p>Shen Jiu could help Luo Binghe in his mourning and Luo Binghe could help him with Shen Yuan's return. However, they are making the same mistake as in PIDW: Shen Jiu is hurting Luo Binghe because of his trauma instead of accepting him.</p><p><b>BONUS: How did Black Bingbing design the dream for his shizun?</b><br/>Black Bingbing: First, shizun needs his brother.<br/>Black Bingbing: And he is always happiest in his house surrounded by the bamboo forest (note to my future self: plant bamboo in my palace 😤)<br/>Black Bingbing: And the cat!

<p>In the past few weeks, Shen Jiu decided to kill time in the Huan Hua Palace library. Although he is so tired that he can barely read, having a purpose makes him feel better. On the worst days, he picks up a random book and tries to focus (he doesn't always succeed). On the few days with more energy and determination, Shen Jiu investigates how to protect his mind from Luo Binghe's dream powers.</p><p>That morning, She Jiu tries to concentrate despite the exhaustion and headache after another sleepless night. He is trying, but insomnia catches him without him being able to prevent it. And after the disastrous medicinal tea incident, Shen Jiu has refused any help.</p><p>He stiffens hearing footsteps approaching him. The servants are quieter and Luo Binghe much louder. Those intermediate steps can only belong to a person that he does not want to see or speak. When Mu Qingfang appears behind a bookcase, Shen Jiu greets him with a frown.</p><p>"What do you want?" He growls at him, ready to control the conversation.</p><p>The healer sighs resigned. The dark circles that mark his eyes are even bigger and he is as pale as if he had not seen the sunlight for a month. And maybe it's true.</p><p>"I’m leaving, Shen-shixiong. Today I have come to say goodbye."</p><p>Shen Jiu keeps his expression indifferent, though something inside him writhes between relief and disappointment. He shouldn't be surprised. He is condemned to be alone.</p><p>Annoyed, Shen Jiu turns his back to continue reading. He has finally found a useful book and concentrating is already difficult to also be distracted.</p><p>"Shen-shixiong, I have helped stabilize Shen-ershixiong's body to prevent him from rotting. But that won't change the fact that that body is dead."</p><p>"I know," he growls acidly.</p><p>This is why he hates being alone with Mu Qingfang. He still tries to convince him that Shen Yuan is dead and will never return; that the Sun and Moon Dew Flower seeds are a fantasy of his mind affected by a qi deviation.</p><p>Sometimes Shen Jiu wonders if he is right.</p><p>And that's a terrifying prospect.</p><p>"If you know, why don't you stop Luo Binghe from continuing his madness?" Mu Qingfang's voice reflects his exhaustion.</p><p>Shen Jiu ignores him.</p><p>"He is still your disciple."</p><p>"He is not."</p><p>Mu Qingfang sighs. And he sounds like he's running out of patience.</p><p>"I will speak to Zhangmen-shixiong." He says it like it's a threat, but it only gets Shen Jiu to laugh. "Shen-shixiong, your mind is unclear. We must treat your qi deviation and Luo Binghe... he is dangerous and unstable."</p><p>Annoyed, Shen Jiu closes the book and turns to glare at him.</p><p>"My mind would be better if you all stopped stressing me."</p><p>Mu Qingfang holds his gaze without allowing his mood to affect him.</p><p>"You need help, Shen-shixiong."</p><p>"What do you want, Mu-shidi?" He almost screams, frustrated that all his conversations always end in the same dead end. "You never listen to me. You don't believe Luo Binghe, but you've helped him preserve a useless corpse. You don't believe me, but you insist on pretending you care..."</p><p>"I care."</p><p>"That's a lie!" Shen Jiu clenches his fists. "You have never cared!"</p><p>"Shen-shixiong, listen to yourself. You are not being reasonable."</p><p>He notices an unpleasant taste in his mouth and a cold in his stomach. He hates that helplessness, which reminds him of the past and all those misunderstandings that made others hate him. He had forgotten that it was Shen Yuan who clarified his image, but without him, he was the same old liar again.</p><p>"Shen-shixiong," Mu Qingfang insists as he says nothing. "Come back with me to Cang Qiong Mountain Sect. Together we can help you."</p><p>But he doesn't need help, only Shen Yuan. But even if he returns to the sect, no one will believe him. Perhaps they will lock him up in Qian Cao Peak while he is free in Luo Binghe's palace. Shen Jiu feels cold inside his bones, through his ribs, freezing his legs to stone. Solitude is nice. Surrounding himself with hypocrites who never cared for him is terrifying.</p><p>"No."</p><p>Mu Qingfang bows his head in defeat.</p><p>"How can I help you?"</p><p>"Stop insisting," he growls. But Shen Jiu bites his lip, thinking of one detail. "When you return to the sect, visit our house. Shen Yuan had many writings. There you will find the truth about Sun and Moon Dew Flower seeds."</p><p><em> I'm not lying </em>, he thinks without daring to say it. His pride makes him bite his tongue like many other times. Shen Jiu breathes a sigh of relief when Mu Qingfang finally leaves him alone in the cold library.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Since the Cang Qiong Mountain Sect attack, which ended with Shen Yuan's death and Shen Jiu's (and later Mu Qingfang's) kidnapping, the sect has been in chaos. A month later, Luo Binghe has finally freed Mu Qingfang and there will be an emergency meeting between the eleven Peak Lords.</p><p>Liu Qingge is restless, almost hysterical. He has been the first to arrive and is unable to sit still while he waits for the rest. From his site, Yue Qingyuan watches over him. Although the leader tries to remain calm, his gaze is rigid and he does not lose his sight. Yue Qingyuan is the reason why Liu Qingge hasn’t been able to leave the sect since his last fight against Luo Binghe. Faced with the severity of his injuries, he ordered him to remain at rest until Mu Qingfang returned.</p><p>Liu Qingge hated waiting, hated accepting his leader's arguments, hated doing nothing while Shen Jiu was in the hands of the demon who had killed his brother.</p><p>He hated being aware of every single broken piece of his wounded heart.</p><p>Almost all of the Peak Lords have arrived already. Only Mu Qingfang is missing.</p><p>Liu Qingge is aware of the impatience that flutters inside his chest, the tension gripping his arms, and the urge to take Cheng Luan out to fly to the demon’s palace. Yue Qingyuan made him promise that he wouldn't do anything as long as Mu Qingfang was watching over the two of them.</p><p>Mu Qingfang is late.</p><p>Liu Qingge suspects that Shen Jiu must be in horrible pain. And he is alone, which is worse. Alone, just with a cruel and selfish demon, who has already tried to attack his sect, kidnap Shen Yuan, lock him in the Water Prison and force him to self-destruct. Liu Qingge hates him more than anything. In the past, he believed he hated Shen Qingqiu, but it was just a stupid rivalry. Luo Binghe is a terrifying monster.</p><p>And he trembles because he suspects what he wants from Shen Jiu.</p><p>Mu Qingfang hasn’t yet arrived and Liu Qingge feels that hideous helplessness again, which makes him feel useless.</p><p>Annoyed, he sits up and heads impatiently for the door.</p><p>"I'm going to find Mu-shidi."</p><p>"Shidi," Yue Qingyuan stopped him just by raising his voice. "Keep calm."</p><p>"How?!" Liu Qingge turns to face his sect leader. "We don't know anything about them! What if that beast has changed his mind?"</p><p>"A disciple from Qian Cao Peak has informed me that Mu-shidi has gone to visit Qing Jing Peak before coming to the meeting."</p><p>Liu Qingge frowns, uneasy and confused for not understanding his martial brother's intentions. Still, reluctantly, he returns to his place and sits down. Although his posture is tense, ready to run or face someone at any moment.</p><p>When Mu Qingfang arrives, almost everyone breathes a sigh of relief. Liu Qingge stiffens and squints at the scrolls and papers the healer is carrying. Mu Qingfang looks exhausted but moves with energy. Upon reaching his site, he drops all the scrolls with a thud. And then he sits up, burying his face in one hand as his posture sags under the weight of concern Liu Qingge senses without understanding.</p><p>No one says anything and everyone watches Mu Qingfang, eager to hear his report.</p><p>"I've made the worst mistake," he splutters before grabbing a bulky scroll. "At the direction of Shen-shixiong, I went to his house. There I found Shen-ershixiong's writings. This is about heavenly demons and all their abilities."</p><p>Liu Qingge leans forward. Although he lacks the patience to read voluminous books, he is desperate to learn more about his enemy.</p><p>"But that is not what I was looking for, but Shen-ershixiong's diary..." The healer's voice trembles and Liu Qingge begins to feel fear. There is something wrong with his sunken expression, something terrifying that clouds the air and makes it colder. "I've made a horrible mistake," he repeats. "Shen-ershixiong is alive."</p><p>Someone is speaking, many are yelling at the same time, and questions are tangled into noise. Liu Qingge opens his mouth without saying anything. And the stupid hope that he had been harboring all this time grows into a fire.</p><p>"How?" Yue Qingyuan's voice, calm despite the uneasy tone, manages to silence the rest. "Was it a mistake?"</p><p>After all, there were only three witnesses to his death: Shen Jiu, who said Shen Yuan would return, Luo Binghe, who took Shen Yuan's corpse, and he, who assumed the worst, believed that Shen Jiu was in denial, and unleashed his fury against the demon.</p><p>Mu Qingfang shakes his head.</p><p>"Shen-ershixiong's body is dead, I have checked it myself. However, it seems that they both knew about the existence of Sun and Moon Dew Flower seeds. And that has been my error," he acknowledges with such intense guilt, almost physical, which makes Liu Qingge fidget. "I thought they were Shen-shixiong delusions and refused to believe him. But Sun and Moon Dew Flower seeds are real."</p><p>"What does that mean?" Liu Qingge is afraid that his hope is wrong and that is why his voice sounds hoarse.</p><p>"Sun and Moon Dew Flower seeds allow a second identical body to grow from qi. Shen-ershixiong's decision was not suicidal, but calculated: his soul left his original body to move to another one."</p><p>Liu Qingge feels that his heart has almost stopped.</p><p>"He is alive."</p><p>Perhaps it is an illusion. Those are the words that Liu Qingge has dreamed of all along, but hearing them they don't seem real. Confused, Liu Qingge lowers his gaze and faces his clenched fists.</p><p>He can still regain the life that was nearly destroyed a month ago.</p><p>"I've never heard of seeds like this!" Qi Qingqi splutters. "Is it possible?"</p><p>"Yes," Shang Qinghua chimes to everyone's surprise. "I... I also read about those seeds a long time ago. But I had forgotten them. Cucu... Shen-ershixiong has a prodigious memory."</p><p>Liu Qingge ignores the babbling of his other martial brothers to look at the healer.</p><p>"Where is Shen Yuan?"</p><p>"I don't know. Shen-ershixiong never wrote down the exact location as a precaution."</p><p>Liu Qingge nods, although deep down he doesn't care: he will find him. And he will also rescue Shen Jiu.</p><p>"However, this has made me understand my mistakes. I must apologize." Mu Qingfang rubs his eyes angrily as if he wants to erase the tiredness. "This humble one has made a terrible mistake with Shen-shixiong."</p><p>Liu Qingge looks at him expectantly and terrified since he has never seen the healer like this before.</p><p>"What happened?" Yue Qingyuan asks. It is a miracle that he remains stable even in that situation.</p><p>"I have made a misdiagnosis. Shen-shixiong's behavior has become erratic and I assumed it would be a qi deviation caused by his brother's grief. However, Shen-shixiong was the only one who knew that Shen- ershixiong is not dead. "</p><p>Yue Qingyuan's expression darkens as if he understands Mu Qingfang’s.</p><p>"What does that mean?" Liu Qingge groans as fear twists his guts. "What's wrong with Shen Jiu?"</p><p>"First, that I have been stupid and have lost his trust." Mu Qingfang sounds frustrated. "Second, he is not suffering any qi deviation from mourning, but something else that I am unaware of. And I have wasted our precious time insisting on a misdiagnosis. Third, I have my suspicions that Shen-ershixiong's unstable behavior is not caused by Shen-ershixiong's self-destruction, but earlier. However, since they have been pretending to be the same person for years, I hadn't noticed until now."</p><p>Liu Qingge instinctively brings his hand to Cheng Luan's hilt. He needs to act or he will explode.</p><p>"What should we do, Mu-shidi?" Yue Qingyuan ignores the others, who are arguing about the veracity of the seeds, to look at the healer.</p><p>"I leave you Shen-ershixiong's writings. I'm afraid that Luo Binghe's character is even more unstable, although he seems to focus all his efforts on reviving his shizun. Still, I recommend studying the heavenly demons and the sword Xin Mo in case a confrontation is inevitable." He gets up without finishing speaking. "For my part, I am going to study Shen-shixiong's symptoms to understand what is happening to him and treat him."</p><p>"I can help!" Liu Qingge exclaims, sitting up as well. "If he needs a qi transfer, I..."</p><p>"I appreciate your offer, Liu-shixiong. But I fear that his altered qi is a reflection of his mental state and not the other way around as I had assumed."</p><p>Liu Qingge hates feeling so useless.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Now that Luo Binghe has protected his shizun's body from decomposition, he can take up other matters that he has neglected this past month. Sometimes, Luo Binghe feels like he is overflowing: too much unfinished business, too many unattainable goals, too many enemies to defeat. Under his skin, there is a fatigue that doesn’t disappear when he sleeps.</p><p>At least, he's left with the consolation that his cold shizun has chosen to stay with him. Mu Qingfang made no secret of his intentions to take Shen Jiu back to Cang Qiong Mountain Sect or try, at least. Luo Binghe almost panicked, terrified at the prospect of losing another shizun. He is aware of his delicate health and that is why he will gather the best healers in his palace. Or he will retain Mu Qingfang.</p><p>Fortunately, he and Mu Qingfang have reached an agreement, and Shen Jiu has chosen to stay by his side. Luo Binghe will guarantee the safety and wishes of his shizun. If he wants calm and solitude, Luo Binghe will protect him until he is better.</p><p>(Shizun has chosen him and that is perhaps the best thing that has happened to him in recent years.)</p><p>Now, he can organize his schedule between securing the power of the palace and continuing to conquer the Demon Realm. Sha Hualing and Mobei-Jun have been controlling his army while he solved his shizuns’ problem. Unfortunately, everything has gone awry, forcing him to make rash decisions.</p><p>Luo Binghe enters his future courtroom. The reform of the palace is slow. He plans to erase the extinct sect's golden past and create a city fit for an emperor. There is already a woman kneeling on the ground when he arrives. His expression turns into a grimace as he recognizes the Little Palace Mistress. The proud lady has turned into a disheveled and tearful thing. She reeks of the dirty waters of the prison and her luxurious clothes are now rags.</p><p>"Greetings, miss." Luo Binghe sneers, making her sob. "This Lord apologizes for not being able to attend to you earlier. I hope you were able to enjoy my hospitality."</p><p>The woman raises her head. The remaining fragments of pride gleam in her reddened eyes.</p><p>"Monster. Demon." She spits in anger and disgust, though fear pales her skin. "What hospitality? You are destroying my home!"</p><p>Luo Binghe raises an eyebrow, delighted that she has fallen into his trap.</p><p>"Oh, I have given you the same hospitality that you gave to shizun. If you are dissatisfied... Should I hit you too?"</p><p>Her breathing quickens. Luo Binghe can smell her panic. The woman presses her bound arms against her body as if she could protect herself. Fortunately for her, he has no intention of wasting any more time. Luo Binghe starts walking around her.</p><p>"You are no longer the Little Palace Mistress, what should I call you now?" Luo Binghe looks at her, but she has lowered her head and refuses to speak. "Little Beggar? The Mistress Who Lost Her Palace?"</p><p>"Xiao Gongzhu," she finally growls. Her voice is drenched in frustration and shame.</p><p>Luo Binghe stops in front of her and kneels to look at her face.</p><p>"Stupid Xiao Gongzhu." Although he smiles, his expression is cold and there is hatred in his eyes. The woman shivers. "You and your stupid father have screwed up everything."</p><p>That gets her to react.</p><p>"What happened to my father? Where is he!?"</p><p>"He ran."</p><p>"You’re lying!"</p><p>"Unfortunately, it is true." Luo Binghe clenches his teeth. "That coward rat abandoned all of you and ran away. But don't worry: I'm looking for him. And you'll know when I find him."</p><p>Xiao Gongzhu's eyes widen as he understood his implied threats and sweet promises of torture. She looks even more pitiful, but it's not enough.</p><p>She dared to hurt his shizun. Although deep down Luo Binghe should be grateful to her because that trigger prompted him to talk to the Old Palace Master. And so he discovered that the man had no intention of freeing Shen Yuan, but was planning to force a trial and take away his power. The fool said to Luo Binghe with a smile: "I will destroy that evil man."</p><p>That was when Luo Binghe decided to gather his army and conquer Huan Hua Palace by force. But then, the second shizun appeared. Luo Binghe didn’t prevent Shen Jiu from taking Shen Yuan because thanks to his blood, his kind shizun would remain attached to him, and the two of them would be safe away from the man’s intrigues.</p><p>But the Old Palace Master announced that he would condemn both of them. He gathered all the elders and Luo Binghe in a secret meeting. At first, he seemed ridiculously angry and humiliated. Luo Binghe secretly laughed until the sect leader said that they would both lock up. When Shen Yuan escaped from the prison, he had broken his word and the Cang Qiong Sect had betrayed their trust. If the sect didn’t hand over the traitors, Huan Hua Palace would take action.</p><p>It was just as Shen Jiu warned him as a boy: humans can be worse than demons.</p><p>Then, Luo Binghe decided to appropriate the Huan Hua Palace and erase that impure sect forever.</p><p>He just wanted to protect one shizun and get answers from the other.</p><p>Luo Binghe stands up to look at Xiao Gongzhu from above. She looks as miserable as a worm.</p><p>"You no longer have power or allies. You have lost everything." Although she tries to hold her ground, her body trembles on the verge of crying. "Your life doesn't even matter. I would use you to attract your father, but he has abandoned you too. That's how useless you are." Luo Binghe appreciates with satisfaction that her cruel words are widening all the cracks created after a month in isolation in the Water Prison. Still, he smiles sweetly. "My grudge is against your father, not with you. You have already paid for your crimes and I don’t plan to hurt you further. I’m going to change the world, Xiao Gongzhu."</p><p>"You're going to destroy it," she sobs.</p><p>"Some things must be destroyed to build new ones. What do you think I am?"</p><p>"A demon."</p><p>"You're wrong: a half-demon. I want to achieve peace between humans and demons."</p><p>She looks at him in surprise and disbelief. He doesn’t care: he doesn’t seek her approval, but to discover if she is a useful tool or a burden to get rid of.</p><p>"I'm going to give you a chance to prove your usefulness to me. Just one. If you succeed, you will earn yourself a place in my new world. If you fail, you will prove to me that you are as useless as you seem. I don't recommend you betraying me," he adds maliciously. "The only sect that has almost my power right now will never listen to you. Furthermore, Cang Qiong Sect is doomed to disappear. I hope you choose better this time."</p><p>Luo Binghe has selected all of her words carefully to tempt her, but also to control her thoughts.</p><p>"What do you want me to do?" Xiao Gongzhu mutters without hiding her mistrust.</p><p>"Find Qiu Haitang."</p><p>That mysterious woman disappeared when Shen Jiu rescued her brother. No one else has seen her again, but Luo Binghe suspects that she may help him understand Shen Jiu. His shizun's nightmares are chaotic and blurry. Strangely, one of his shizuns suffers while the other's dreams are calmer. Luo Binghe intuits that they hide dark secrets that brings a new meaning to Qiu Haitang's words.</p><p>That would also explain why Shen Jiu warned him that humans were worse than demons.</p><p>Luo Binghe will ask him directly, but he is aware that the pain has left him in a dangerously vulnerable state. When he is better (and Shen Yuan has returned), together they will create a better world. Meanwhile, Luo Binghe will ensure his power.</p><p>He needs his shizuns’ support before he conquers the Human Realm.</p><p>Xiao Gongzhu accepts their deal and Luo Binghe orders some demonic servants to take her to a room so that she can shower and change her clothes. He acts nice, willing to teach her that he is both a powerful and caring ally. Despite his demonic heritage, he is not cruel. She was unfair and he punished her. But if she is useful, he will reward her.</p><p>Her father is the evil one. Her father wanted to abuse his power. Her father abandoned her.</p><p>Those are the ideas that Luo Binghe wants to put into her head.</p><p>Luo Binghe stiffens as he notices that one of the protective seals surrounding the palace has been broken. He frowns. Someone stupid enough has decided to attack him.</p><p>Xin Mo purrs into his sheath as Luo Binghe leaves the room to go after the intruder.</p><p>He is not surprised to discover Liu Qingge attempting to penetrate the palace's defenses. Hatred burns in his stomach when the two of them look into each other's eyes.</p><p>"I told you to not come back," Luo Binghe reminds him in a calm voice but on the verge of breaking.</p><p>"I’ve come for Shen Jiu." Liu Qingge already has his sword drawn and points the blade at him. "Let me see him."</p><p>"Never."</p><p>In an instant, he also unsheathes Xin Mo.</p><p>The two of them challenge each other in silence, without moving, just keeping an eye on their adversary.</p><p>Liu Qingge is the first to attack.</p><p>He moves swiftly, but Luo Binghe stops his assault without difficulty. Xin Mo vibrates in his hands ecstatically. It's been a long time since the last massacre and his sword hunger is contagious. Luo Binghe longs to tear that cultivator apart until he begs for his forgiveness. Jealousy moves his arms when he attacks him. He always dreamed of being like Liu Qingge, just as beautiful and perfect, being the person that Shizun would always trust.</p><p>He hates him. He hated him very much.</p><p>Liu Qingge is the reason why he lost control and shizun died.</p><p>Both engage in furious and violent combat with which they destroy their surroundings. Trees burst into splinters and qi burns devour the grass. Luo Binghe feels alive after a month accompanying a corpse. But he is also afraid.</p><p>Last time, Liu Qingge almost took Shen Jiu away.</p><p><em> He wouldn't bother you anymore if you killed him </em> , the sword whispers to him. <em> Tear off his arms and legs. Tear his guts out, crush his head. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. </em></p><p>Xin Mo's voice has grown louder in recent years. Their ideas sink into his blood until they burn. Xin Mo takes his worst wishes and twists them to make them more tempting.</p><p>While Liu Qingge's attacks are precise and coordinated, Luo Binghe's become more savage and violent, so brutal that the cultivator must grasp his sword with both hands or he will disarm him.</p><p>
<em> Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. </em>
</p><p>The seal on his forehead glows as his demonic qi surges in waves that strike his enemy. Last time he managed to defeat him like this, but today Liu Qingge grits his teeth and continues to insist, as stubborn as he is.</p><p>Although he is a better swordsman, Luo Binghe finds with satisfaction that he is more powerful. And his perfect technique is unable to overcome his pure and uncontrolled power. Luo Binghe smiles, showing his fangs, as Liu Qingge starts to back away. His rival has clenched teeth and is sweaty. The qi has ripped his sleeves and strands of hair fall down his face. Luo Binghe uses a feint to trick him. Liu Qingge prepares to counter an attack, but he moves faster and manages to kick him in the stomach. With a grunt, the cultivator almost lost his balance, but swallows the pain and doesn’t fall.</p><p>The fight gets dirtier. Luo Binghe manages to land a punch in his face and takes advantage of his opening to sink Xin Mo into his flesh.</p><p>
<em> Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. </em>
</p><p>The temptation is immense, but Luo Binghe pulls the sword away and pounces on him like an animal. Despite the desire that beats in his sharp nails, in the teeth that he wishes to sink into his throat until it tears, Luo Binghe controls his most beastly side. For shizun. Neither Shen Yuan nor Shen Jiu will forgive him if he kills that stupid meddler.</p><p>Liu Qingge has also lost his weapon. He is a bloody mess when Luo Binghe pins him to the ground with one hand at his throat, almost choking him and the other twisting his arm.</p><p>"I told you to not come back," he growls, almost roaring.</p><p>Despite his defeat, the cultivator looks at him defiantly. He may be hurt, his pristine appearance has disappeared under wounds, blood, and dirt, but in his eyes, the arrogance of believing unbeatable still shines.</p><p>"You can't stop me, demon."</p><p>"Of course I can. I'm doing it right now."</p><p>Liu Qingge tries to move, but Luo Binghe's weight has him pinned down. He manages to drag his free arm to grab Luo Binghe's wrist and dig his nails into it.</p><p>"I know what you want," he growls with difficulty. "I won’t allow you to touch Shen Jiu."</p><p>Luo Binghe tilts his face towards his defeated enemy.</p><p>"I'll make him want it," he promises with a smirk. "Why are you worried about shizun? I will never hurt him. And I am true to my word." His smile becomes more twisted and cruel. "You should worry about yourself. I told you I'd rip your arm off if you come back."</p><p>There is a flash of panic in Liu Qingge's eyes as he stretches out his right arm and begins to twist it. He doesn't scream, maybe neither can he with his other hand holding his throat.</p><p>And Luo Binghe twists the limb, savoring the noise of his bones and ligaments breaking. He twists and turns until...</p><p>
<em> Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. </em>
</p><p>It would be so delicious to mutilate the War God forever. However, Luo Binghe lets go of Liu Qingge before ripping off his limb. His arm falls, limp, and twisted at an impossible angle. Liu Qingge's breathing sounds raged and he has his eyes closed, perhaps on the verge of blacking out. When Luo Binghe takes his hand away, he appreciates that he has a collection of bruises on his neck.</p><p>It’s not enough, Xin Mo keeps screaming, but Luo Binghe calms down and gets up. After retrieving the sword from the ground, he slices through a portal in midair and then picks up Liu Qingge's body without delicacy.</p><p>On the other side is Qiong Ding Peak.</p><p>Several disciples shout when they see them. Most run away, probably to warn their shizun about him, while the older ones watch him suspiciously. As Luo Binghe had guessed, Yue Qingyuan arrives right away.</p><p>The sect leader carries Xuan Su in his hand, though still sheathed. His posture is tense, but unlike others, he knows how to control his emotions.</p><p>Luo Binghe throws Liu Qingge's bloody body to the ground, right in front of him. Yue Qingyuan crouches down to examine his shidi's vital signs.</p><p>"What does this mean, Luo Binghe?"</p><p>"Next time, he won't be so lucky," he warns him. "Next time, I'll assume Cang Qiong Sect is challenging me."</p><p>Since the <em> incident </em>a month ago, Yue Qingyuan has spoken with Luo Binghe to demand the release of Mu Qingfang and Shen Jiu. Luo Binghe knows that he doesn't want a confrontation, but he will attack if he has no choice. Despite the big talk he has with Xiao Gongzhu, his power is still unstable and it is not convenient for him to face Cang Qiong Mountain Sect so soon. That is one of the reasons why he withdrew his fake monster army when Shen Yuan died (the other reason, because Shen Jiu asked him to).</p><p>But Yue Qingyuan has a terrible weakness: he cares too much about his martial siblings and that makes him a coward. He agreed to not intervene with the promise that Mu Qingfang will take care of Shen Jiu and will also not do anything if he threatens to destroy everyone.</p><p>Yue Qingyuan has worried wrinkles as he examines Liu Qingge's injuries.</p><p>"I hope we can keep the peace, sect leader Yue."</p><p>Luo Binghe doesn't say anything else: his message is clear.</p>

<p>Mu Qingfang returns a month later.</p><p>To Shen Jiu's surprise, he still looks exhausted and stressed. <em> He deserves it, </em> he thinks bitterly. Although he is still upset, angry, and disappointed, Shen Jiu is also very tired. And that's why he doesn't growl when he sees his martial brother around the palace gardens.</p><p>"Shen-shixiong," Mu Qingfang greets him.</p><p>He wants to ignore him just as Mu Qingfang ignored his words, but his presence is a novelty in the monotony of a routine of waiting, trying to read, trying to sleep, trying to not lose hope. It also relieves him of the pressure of feeling that the Cang Qiong Mountain Sect had forgotten about him.</p><p>There are very few reasons why Mu Qingfang would return. The most important: he has found Shen Yuan's writings. Shen Jiu pulls a silent talisman from his sleeve and creates a safe space for both of them. Afterward, he indicates that he can sit next to him.</p><p>Mu Qingfang takes some letters and packages from his qiankun pouch and hands them to Shen Jiu.</p><p>"Your disciples have written to you," he explains.</p><p>Shen Jiu picks it up curiously but puts it on his knees instead of opening the letters. He'll do it later, when he's alone.</p><p>"I’m not lying," Shen Jiu growls as Mu Qingfang doesn’t say anything.</p><p>His shidi closes his eyes before lowering his head.</p><p>"This humble one made a mistake and would like to apologize to Shen-shixiong."</p><p>Shen Jiu is used to having his words and actions misinterpreted. He already accepts it with resignation, rejecting all apologies for not believing they are sincere. Mu Qingfang's makes him squint his eyes suspiciously.</p><p>"I hope, Mu-shidi, that the sect is acting now that the truth is known."</p><p>"We are trying," he sighs. "Your brother didn’t write the location of his body as a precaution. And we have other problems."</p><p>Shen Jiu raises an eyebrow, encouraging him to explain. What's more important than finding Shen Yuan? Isn't Shen Yuan the one who everyone loves?</p><p>"We are also studying all the information we have about heavenly demons. We have... different opinions about Luo Binghe’s problem." Mu Qingfang speaks slowly, almost afraid of saying the wrong words. "I was with him for a month. He is powerful but unstable and Shen-ershixiong's death has affected him. Shen-shixiong, why haven't you told him the truth?"</p><p>Shen Jiu tenses, uncomfortable.</p><p>"Because he is obsessed with Shen Yuan."</p><p>"He still thinks he's dead and that is affecting his mind."</p><p>"He was already dangerous before Shen Yuan self-destructed," Shen Jiu clenches his fists.</p><p>"Even as a disciple?"</p><p>"What are you talking about?"</p><p>"Was Luo Binghe dangerous when he was your disciple?"</p><p>"No." Shen Jiu frowns. "I don't know anymore. Maybe he was, but he's a lying demon who tricked us."</p><p>"I remember him. He was a very diligent disciple who always tried to show his best."</p><p>"People change."</p><p>"After these months, I wonder if the boy who studied in my garden has turned into a demon or is it the fault of that sword." Mu Qingfang looks into Shen Jiu's eyes. "Demonic swords are dangerous and I fear that the one he uses is especially harmful. We have found that Luo Binghe is prone to qi deviations, but what worries me is that that sword will control his actions. We should tell him the truth about Shen-ershixiong."</p><p>"No." He purses his lips until they turn white.</p><p>"The trauma of his death is affecting him, Luo Binghe also has the power to help us bring Shen-ershixiong back..." Mu Qingfang takes a deep breath and pauses. "And his attempts to resurrect Shen-ershixiong are harming him. His condition is delicate and yet he is wasting his energy daily."</p><p>Shen Jiu clenches his fists even more, digging his nails into his flesh.</p><p>"He's dangerous," he repeats. "I will keep him away from my brother."</p><p>"But you two intended to reforge his other sword."</p><p>"You can do it. I didn't get a chance to ask Wei Qingwei, but now you can work on it if you're so worried about Luo Binghe," he mutters spitefully.</p><p>"If you consider Luo Binghe to be obsessive, dangerous, and without redemption, why are you staying here instead of returning to the sect?"</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Mu Qingfang's visit left him with a headache. Shen Jiu no longer knows if he planned to convince him to come back, to do something with Luo Binghe, or to inform him of all the unsolvable problems they have. Sometimes Shen Jiu feels like he is drowning among so many dark thoughts.</p><p>
<em> The sword. Luo Binghe. Shen Yuan. Qi deviation. Dream Demon. Liu Qingge. Shen Yuan doesn’t come back. Why hasn't he come back yet? </em>
</p><p>Shen Jiu opens his eyes. He is lying on his bed. The afternoon slides to the other side of the window and he still has all the unopened letters. But he lacks the courage to read what has been written to him. <em> I'll do it later </em>, he thinks as he sighs.</p><p>Mu Qingfang's words have left him shaken. They spoke during a shichen, but it feels like forever. The most confusing thing about their conversation was that the healer only asked him questions.</p><p>Questions that still haunt him, echoing inside his head. Some questions, the most dangerous, Shen Jiu tried to ignore despite the gaze of his martial brother.</p><p>He sits up after hearing a noise on the other side of the door. Despite his exhaustion, he decides to leave his room. It's all those questions' fault, churning inside his stomach and prompting him to investigate what's going on with Luo Binghe now.</p><p>Shen Jiu finds Luo Binghe sweaty and bloody outside. He wears black armor and the symbol on his forehead glows like his eyes. They both look at each other. Luo Binghe is surrounded by servants and one of his generals, the ice demon. They reek of war and slaughter, and Shen Jiu wonders if it was to quench the sword or because of those intentions that he doesn't understand.</p><p><em> Damn Mu Qingfang and damn questions </em>, he thinks, annoyed. Shen Jiu shakes his head to chase away those thoughts before crossing his arms, judging his former disciple.</p><p>"Shizun," he greets him, bowing his head respectfully. However, Luo Binghe is tense, perhaps uncomfortable with his presence, perhaps not expecting him to take an interest in his affairs.</p><p>"Humans or demons?"</p><p>"Demon rebellious."</p><p>Although Shen Jiu remains nonchalant, something inside him calms down. Luo Binghe hasn’t shown the intention to attack human cities. For now.</p><p>Shen Jiu is not naive, but rather suspicious.</p><p>"Leave," he orders everyone with a flick of his sleeve.</p><p>The servants disappear without hesitation, only the ice demon ignores him until Luo Binghe dispatches him with a nod. The Demon Lord watches expectantly at Shen Jiu, who approaches him still with all those questions stuck inside.</p><p>"You look awful," he clicks his tongue.</p><p>"Is shizun worried about this humble disciple?" He has the nerve to smile at him.</p><p>Luo Binghe doesn't seem hurt, but Shen Jiu can sense that he's not well. His demonic qi is uneven and outstrips the other. There is no balance between his two natures. Shen Jiu already knew it, he has known since the day Shen Yuan sacrificed himself to calm Luo Binghe's chaos, but he has wanted to ignore it. Because recognizing that Luo Binghe's inner demons continue to devour his heart is to accept that Shen Yuan's sacrifice was useless.</p><p>And Mu Qingfang's voice sounds like an echo.</p><p>"Follow me," he growls, turning his back on him.</p><p>They walk up to Luo Binghe's quarters. It is Shen Jiu's first time entering and although he feels uncomfortable stepping on the demon's rooms, he has no intention of having Luo Binghe dirty his.</p><p>Shen Jiu forces his disciple to sit down and then orders some servants to prepare a bath. Luo Binghe is still irritatingly perfect since he is just tired and without any injuries. Even so, Shen Jiu is unable to keep ignoring those other invisible wounds that derail his qi and perhaps his thoughts.</p><p>And he doesn't want to tell him the truth. He can’t do it. He will protect Shen Yuan from Luo Binghe's obsession, but he no longer feels comfortable allowing the demon to continue wounding himself. Leaving would be very easy, abandoning him too (he already did it once), but this time Shen Jiu sits next to Luo Binghe and takes his wrist to pass him spiritual energy.</p><p>Neither says anything.</p><p>Shen Jiu's energy is affected and soon he feels the demonic qi trying to devour his veins. With a weary sigh, he releases Luo Binghe, ignoring his expression (and his hungry smile, the adoration in his eyes).</p><p>"Thanks, shizun."</p><p>"If you are grateful," Shen Jiu sits up, brushing off his clothes to make sure they haven't gotten stained. "Stop bothering this master and take care of your health."</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Three months after Shen Yuan's self-destruction, Mu Qingfang returns. They meet again in the garden. This time, Luo Binghe has prepared tea and pastries, but the Demon Lord has left them alone. Even so, Shen Jiu places another silent talisman to prevent anyone from hearing them.</p><p>"Your disciples send you regards," Mu Qingfang begins, giving him new letters.</p><p>He picks them up with a heavy heart since he hasn’t opened the previous ones yet. He never found the strength and the weeks passed too fast. This time he will do it soon.</p><p>"How are you feeling, Shen-shixiong?"</p><p>Shen Jiu shrugs.</p><p>"Normal."</p><p>"Normal is not necessarily good," observes the healer. "You look tired."</p><p>Because there are nights when he still doesn't sleep. Because he spends every day waiting when he doesn't have the energy to do anything. Because...</p><p>"I’m clearing Luo Binghe's meridians with my spiritual energy," he replies instead.</p><p>Mu Qingfang looks at him with concern.</p><p>"Shen-shixiong, your health is also delicate and you always had a predisposition for qi deviations. It is not safe."</p><p>"You said I should do something with Luo Binghe, right? That's what I'm doing."</p><p>He is so stubborn that Mu Qingfang sighs.</p><p>"Wouldn't it be easier to tell him the truth about Shen-ershixiong?"</p><p>"No." Shen Jiu takes a deep breath. "I will control Luo Binghe."</p><p>Because Shen Yuan will return one day and he will be there to protect him. And next time, Luo Binghe will not suffer any qi deviation that forces anyone to self-destruct.</p><p>Shen Jiu looks at the mountain of letters. He wants to ask Mu Qingfang about Yue Qingyuan, Liu Qingge, and the others, but in the end, he decides to remain quiet. Liu Qingge hasn’t returned since he learned that Shen Yuan is alive. And although Shen Jiu doesn’t want to be jealous of his most important person, he inevitably feels expendable and forgettable again.</p><p>"Shen-shixiong, have you thought about what I told you about going back to the sect?"</p><p>"No. Someone must keep an eye on Luo Binghe."</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Mu Qingfang returns four months after Shen Yuan's self-destruction with more letters that Shen Jiu is still unable to open. He doesn’t even know who has written to him, because he is afraid of discovering in all those who have not.</p><p>"How are you feeling, Shen-shixiong?"</p><p>Uneasy. Worried. Tired. Disorientated.</p><p>"Normal."</p><p>"Your disciples always ask me if Shen-shixiong has written back to them. Have you thought about doing that?"</p><p>Shen Jiu shrugs.</p><p>"Maybe you could do it," Mu Qingfang suggests. "What do you usually do in the palace?"</p><p>He frowns, not acknowledging that his days are empty, and yet they fade very quickly. Before he was always burdened with reports and works, investigations, and his disciples’ studies. Suddenly fear embraces Shen Jiu underneath his skin. He no longer remembers when he lost his motivation.</p><p>"Shen-shixiong?"</p><p>Mu Qingfang looks at him patiently, waiting for an answer that gets stuck in his throat.</p><p>"I'll write to them," he replies, fleeing the truth. "Do you have news?"</p><p>"We still don't know where Shen-ershixiong is buried. We have found a list of places that he would have liked to visit. Or perhaps he has visited. We are investigating them." Mu Qingfang tries to smile to calm Shen Jiu's uneasiness. "Wei Qingwei has reforged Zheng Yang."</p><p>"Nice."</p><p>The healer has his hands on the table and his fingers interlock nervously.</p><p>"You know? Liu-shidi..."</p><p>"I don't want to talk about him."</p><p>Liu Qingge will likely be in charge of traveling to all those amazing places to search for Shen Yuan. It's okay. Shen Jiu trusts Liu Qingge. And even though it hurts, Liu Qingge is a better suitor than Luo Binghe.</p><p>He just has to forget about him and those stupid feelings that scratch his battered heart.</p><p>"Shen-shixiong, have you thought about going back to the sect?"</p><p>"I already told you that I have to watch over Luo Binghe."</p><p>"What about one day? If Shen-shixiong prefers to stay here, we won't stop you. But you can come to visit us someday."</p><p>"I will think about it."</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Five months after Shen Yuan's self-destruction, when Mu Qingfang hands him more letters, Shen Jiu freezes. The healer looks at him expectantly until he sighs.</p><p>"Shen-shixiong didn't write back, am I right?"</p><p>He has forgotten. As he always forgets to read the letters. They are a monster that grows in his room and that he never dares to confront.</p><p>"I've been busy."</p><p>"You haven't come to visit us either," Mu Qingfang points out.</p><p>Shen Jiu grits his teeth after feeling judged. As always. It's an old feeling that he never gets used to. He notices all of Mu Qingfang's accusations (the ones he says and the ones he doesn't) on his skin.</p><p>"Why do you insist so much?" He groans, unable to control himself. Maybe it's the shame of letting the days go by without ever daring to make that decision. "You always ask me the same thing. Why?"</p><p>"I want to understand why Shen-shixiong doesn't want to go back to his family."</p><p>"Because you are not my family!"</p><p>He instantly regrets what he has said. Shen Jiu grabs a cup of tea as an excuse to remain silent.</p><p>"Maybe Shen-shixiong doesn't want to go back because he's afraid that his house is empty?" Mu Qingfang's voice is soft and kind. "I know you miss him."</p><p>Shen Jiu doesn't understand why he suddenly wants to cry.</p><p>"Yes. Don't insist again."</p><p>"If you go back to Cang Qiong Mountain Sect you don't have to go back to Qing Jing Peak..."</p><p>"Don't insist," he growls at him.</p><p>All of Mu Qingfang's visits always leave him shaking. As if with patience and questions, he was trying to cross all of his shields.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Shen Jiu is hysterical when Mu Qingfang returns six months after Shen Yuan's self-destruction. Six months. Half-year. And he hasn’t come back. Shen Yuan hasn’t come back.</p><p>"Shen-shixiong?" Mu Qingfang watches him tense, sensing his stress. "What's wrong?"</p><p>Shen Jiu feels the urge to break something, to get up and scream, to cover his face with his hands, to bite his nails, to move until exhaustion is ripped from his body.</p><p>But he remains immobile.</p><p>"Shen Yuan hasn't returned yet," he mutters.</p><p>"He will," the healer tries to comfort him.</p><p>But he's lying, right? He sure is lying. And Shen Jiu understands. Maybe everyone knows that Shen Yuan will not come back and they are deceiving him.</p><p>He lets out a dry, bitter laugh.</p><p>"He won’t. Why have I been such an idiot?"</p><p>"Shen-shixiong?"</p><p>"Half a year, Mu-shidi! He should have returned by now!" Shen Jiu's throat and eyes itch. His voice has been broken into pieces, into sharp words. "You knew it right?"</p><p>"Know what?"</p><p>"That Shen Yuan is gone! Of course, he is gone! Why should he return? His soul must have reached his new body as soon as he self-destructed. Maybe he even looks different! Shen Yuan is finally free and he's gone far away from everyone... "</p><p><em> He has abandoned me. </em> That's what he doesn't dare to say out loud. <em> He left without me. </em></p><p>"Shen-shixiong!" It is the first time that Mu Qingfang has raised his voice since those visits began. "What are you saying? Shen Yuan would never abandon you..."</p><p>"He has."</p><p>The healer takes a deep breath before looking at him decisively.</p><p>"There are no records on Sun and Moon Dew Flower seeds. We don’t know how it works exactly nor do we have previous cases to predict what will happen. We cannot rule out the possibility that the process has failed, that it has been left incomplete, or even that Luo Binghe's enchantments to summon his soul are interfering. The possibility that he died is more likely that he abandoned you. Why was that your first thought? "</p><p>"It's not that implausible."</p><p>"Liu-shidi told me that Shen Yuan's last words were for you. He said that you would see each other soon, do you really think Shen Yuan would abandon you?"</p><p>Shen Jiu doesn't hesitate when he looks into his eyes and nods.</p><p>"That will never happen, Shen-shixiong." Although Mu Qingfang tries to speak in a calm voice, to Shen Jiu it sounds mocking. "He loves you, he is your brother. He will never abandon you..."</p><p>Every word accumulates inside his chest. Shen Jiu closes his eyes, but he can't escape Mu Qingfang's stupid naivety.</p><p>"But it already happened."</p><p>The healer blinks in surprise. Shen Jiu quickly rubs his eyes to erase all those treacherous tears.</p><p>"How?"</p><p>"Forget it."</p><p>"Shen-shixiong..." Mu Qingfang hesitates. "Something happened in the past with Shen-ershixiong?"</p><p>Unable to answer, Shen Jiu shakes his head. Mu Qingfang looks relieved. He reaches out a hand to find his for a comforting touch.</p><p>"I can assume it was a bad experience, but Shen-ershixiong is different. He is your brother and..."</p><p>"That doesn’t mean anything."</p><p>"He is very close to you."</p><p>Shen Jiu has started biting his lips. He notices the taste of blood inside his mouth.</p><p>"That doesn't mean anything," he repeats. "Qi-Ge did it."</p><p>"Gi-Ge?"</p><p>"My... older brother."</p><p>There is something inside him that has been broken into pieces. Shen Jiu closes his eyes with the hope that Mu Qingfang and his curiosity will disappear, that they will leave him alone, surrounded by silence.</p><p>But when he opens his eyes, the healer is still in front of him. He doesn't say anything, just waits patiently for him to continue speaking. Shen Jiu tries to repair all the shields, all the walls that he built years ago to protect himself. But all of his protections are cracked.</p><p>"It's not important," Shen Jiu says in a brittle voice. "It happened a long time ago. It doesn't matter anymore."</p><p>"It matters," Mu Qingfang corrects him. "Because it still affects you."</p><p>And those words make Shen Jiu aware of a wound that has been with him since he was little. It is an immense wound, which has grown with him, bloody and putrid.</p><p>"Do you want to talk about Qi-Ge?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"It's okay." To his surprise, Mu Qingfang doesn't insist and Shen Jiu relaxes a bit. "Although I don't know him, I dare to say that Shen-ershixiong is different than Qi-Ge. He chose to self-destruct to protect you and he promised that he would return."</p><p>"Qi-Ge also left to protect me and promised that he would return," he growls bitterly, his teeth clenched.</p><p>"Maybe Qi-Ge..."</p><p>"Let's not talk about Qi-Ge! I found him. He was happy and rich and powerful. He had forgotten about me."</p><p>Shen Jiu looks away. It's getting harder to control his tears and his voice.</p><p>"Okay, we won't talk about Qi-Ge, but about Shen-ershixiong. Why do you think he would abandon you?"</p><p>"Because I forced him to be Shen Qingqiu." On this occasion, the response is immediate. "He always told me that he hated it. I kept him locked in the bamboo house so that no one would discover us. I always threatened him, I punished him with copying the rules and writing a manual more than three hundred times. I was never nice to him. Why should Shen Yuan return with me?"</p><p>"So the problem is not that you don't trust Shen Yuan, but that you don't trust yourself."</p><p>Shen Jiu opens his mouth, speechless.</p><p>"Of course," he acknowledges dejectedly. "I'm a problem."</p><p>"No, Shen-shixiong, you have a problem. It is different."</p><p>"I don’t see the difference."</p><p>"Being a problem means that everything it’s your fault and there is nothing you can do to change it. However, having a problem means that there are things you cannot control. And we can help you."</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Seven months after Shen Yuan's self-destruction, Mu Qingfang brings not only letters but also a pile of scrolls.</p><p>"I have thought that I can give you the latest works of your disciples," he explains. "I know you're not doing anything. I don't want to pressure you, but I think it would be good if you are distracted. Maybe correcting them is easier than writing a letter."</p><p>Shen Jiu nods before taking the exercises. Although he hates being told what to do, deep down inside he recognizes that Mu Qingfang is right. At least that will allow him to distract himself and forget all those dark thoughts that do not leave him alone.</p><p>"If Shen-shixiong doesn't mind, your disciples would like to come to visit you. They could come once a week. Do you think that is enough time for you to correct their work and send them new exercises?"</p><p>"Why are you bothering?" Shen Jiu looks at the healer suspiciously.</p><p>"Even though you are no longer in Cang Qiong Mountain Sect, you are still our Qing Jing Peak Lord. We haven’t forgotten."</p><p>Lately, Mu Qingfang's words manage to break through all of his protections. Sometimes they point out injuries that Shen Jiu was trying to ignore. Other times, they comfort him. Shen Jiu takes a deep breath, remembering the time when he yelled at him and Luo Binghe that he was still Shen Qingqiu.</p><p>Shen Jiu fiddles with the tray of tea and sweets that Luo Binghe prepares every month. Mu Qingfang always waits for him to speak and only adds something when the silence is too thick.</p><p>"There is something I don’t understand, Shen-shixiong. You are not locked up or unarmed, but you have never shown interest in returning to us. Why?"</p><p>Shen Jiu shrugs.</p><p>"We always talk about the same thing," he says while selecting an osmanthus cake. "Why?"</p><p>"You cannot always dodge all questions with other questions, Shen-shixiong." Mu Qingfang sighs. "Some of your martial siblings are worried that Luo Binghe will retain you with hypnosis or demonic tricks."</p><p>Shen Jiu almost rolls his eyes. He knows that nobody cares about him.</p><p>"And what do you think?" He looks at the healer. "If you considered Luo Binghe a threat to me, you would have tried to separate us, right? Unless you prefer to sacrifice me to end a worse enemy."</p><p>Mu Qingfang pinches the bridge of his nose.</p><p>"We also have to talk about your mistrust of everyone. It is unhealthy, Shen-shixiong."</p><p>"It's a defense mechanism."</p><p>"Now what are you trying to protect yourself from?"</p><p>Mu Qingfang has become more accurate with his questions. Despite the distance, the healer doesn’t need to move to catch his soul. Shen Jiu picks up another cake, ignoring him.</p><p>"Maybe you are scared?"</p><p>"Of course not!" He nearly smashes the cake, offended. "I’m not a vulnerable child, Mu-shidi."</p><p>"We are all vulnerable, Shen-shixiong. And I suspect that you use your mistrust because you fear that you will be betrayed. That you will be abandoned again as with Qi-Ge."</p><p>Shen Jiu grits his teeth.</p><p>"We won't talk about Qi-Ge."</p><p>"Then answer me and finally be honest: why do you avoid going back to the sect?"</p><p>There are so many reasons that Shen Jiu goes blank. He must choose carefully or Mu Qingfang will continue to crumble his soul.</p><p>"There is no difference between waiting here or waiting at Cang Qiong Mountain Sect."</p><p>"Right now, I could make you a list of differences." Mu Qingfang is more serious than usual and that makes Shen Jiu uneasy. "First, there is the house you have been living in all these years."</p><p>"A house is just a house. I have a similar room here."</p><p>"Second, you can move freely."</p><p>"I can also move freely."</p><p>"You haven't left the palace in seven months and we always meet in the same place."</p><p>"Just because I can go where I want doesn't mean I want to."</p><p>Shen Jiu plays with his cup of tea while Mu Qingfanf sighs.</p><p>"You know what I suspect, Shen-shixiong? That Luo Binghe doesn't need to lock you up because you've already done it yourself. You're isolated and you know it, but you don't care. There are two reasons why I think you're afraid to go back to Cang Qiong Mountain Sect."</p><p>"I already told you: I'm not scared."</p><p>"First, you have never considered Qing Jing Peak your home. Second, deep down you are grateful that Luo Binghe allows you to isolate yourself." Shen Jiu slams the table with his cup, but Mu Qingfang stops him with his gaze. "Look into your heart, Shen-shixiong, and then tell me I'm wrong."</p><p>He can’t do it. The impulse is in his throat, but no air is coming from his lungs. Shen Jiu feels like he's drowning. There is a knot in his chest so big it crushes his ribs and heart.</p><p>"We'll go slowly, is that okay, Shen-shixiong?"</p><p>He nods weakly, not entirely aware of why he's doing it.</p><p>"Do you consider Qing Jing Peak your home?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Do you consider Cang Qiong Mountain Sect your home?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"A few sessions ago, you told me that you didn't consider us your family, is that true?"</p><p>Shen Jiu wonders how those visits have turned into <em> sessions </em>.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Answering with monosyllables is easy. And those questions are less annoying than others. At least they don't make him feel broken or flawed, cruel and heartless for not responding to letters or hiding the truth from Luo Binghe.</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>Shen Jiu takes a deep breath.</p><p>"I prefer yes or no questions."</p><p>"But those answers don’t allow me to help you, Shen-shixiong."</p><p>"Why do you always say that you want to help me or that you care about me? It's a lie."</p><p>Mu Qingfang sighs wearily.</p><p>"It isn't, Shen-shixiong. You worry us." He raises his hand, asking for his silence when Shen Jiu opens his mouth. "You are our martial brother. We are all concerned about your health. That is why I am here. You always get angry when I tell you, so could you explain it to me? I want to show you that all those doubts are inside your head."</p><p>"Because you've never cared about me, but for Shen Yuan." That is a truth that he has hidden with resentment in the bottom of his heart, without understanding that it only hurt him. But this time he decides to tell it to Mu Qingfang. Because after seven months, he knows that he will listen to him. "You all hated me until Shen Yuan arrived. Shen Yuan is the Shen Qingqiu you all want, not me."</p><p>"I admit that we haven't had time to get used to the fact that you are two and not one," he acknowledges. "That's why we need you to let us meet you..."</p><p>"You already knew me! I was alone when we were disciples. And you hated me. Everyone. You never tried to listen to me. Never."</p><p>His breathing is ragged. Releasing all that grudge is liberating, but it also leaves him physically exhausted.</p><p>"Please, Shen-shixiong, go on."</p><p>"Never mind."</p><p>"If it affects you, it is important. What happened?"</p><p>Shen Jiu closes his eyes to try to protect himself.</p><p>"I never used prostitutes for carnal pleasure. I would never buy a woman's body. But you spread those rumors and even Qi Qingqi vetoed me from her peak. I never tried to kill Liu Qingge. A ghost attacked him from behind and I protected that ungrateful brute. But it doesn't matter. I’m the lustful and traitorous Shen Qingqiu. My cultivation is weak because I am lazy, not because I was crippled. Are you satisfied, Mu-shidi?"</p><p>Mu Qingfang's expression has darkened. It is difficult for him to maintain his serene attitude as a doctor. Shen Jiu lowers his gaze. Now he feels too exposed. Vulnerable. Fragile.</p><p>"Shen-shixiong, you shouldn't feel embarrassed about any of this. It wasn't your fault, but... ours. Do you want us to continue talking about this?"</p><p>"No." He takes a deep breath. "Not today."</p><p>"Do you prefer to rest?"</p><p>"Please."</p><p>"Shen-shixiong, I haven't told anyone anything we talked about. And I won't. But would you want me to inform the rest of your martial siblings about their mistakes?"</p><p>Shen Jiu shrugs.</p><p>"Does it matter?"</p><p>"Of course. If it affects you, it matters. You are important, never forget it."</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>After eight months of waiting, Shen Jiu is finally relieved when Mu Qingfang arrives. And guilt, when he gives him more letters.</p><p>"Can you ask them to stop sending me correspondence?" Shen Jiu acknowledges with a sigh. "I started to read the first ones. But having more overwhelms me. I feel like I'll never finish."</p><p>"It's okay. I have also noticed that you have only sent musical exercises to the disciples who have visited you."</p><p>Because they are the only duties that he cannot correct at the moment, but when they return.</p><p>"It's okay, Shen-shixiong. You've started to move and that's good."</p><p>"It's frustrating," he growls. "I want to do more, but I always end up very tired or sleepy. I leave it all for tomorrow, but the next day I don't get it either."</p><p>"As I said, Shen-shixiong, it's fine. Try to do little every day until you get back on track. I've been researching what you suffer from."</p><p>Shen Jiu looks at him curiously.</p><p>"Poison? Drugs? Is it Luo Binghe's thing?"</p><p>"What have we talked about your excessive mistrust?"</p><p>"I have my reasons!"</p><p>"Not everything is deceit or betrayal, Shen-shixiong. And I think your suspicion is yet another symptom."</p><p>"About what."</p><p>"An invisible disease that affects your head."</p><p>Shen Jiu stiffens defensively.</p><p>"I'm not crazy."</p><p>"You are not. You have wounds, some are still open, others are scars that have marked you. But they just cannot be seen. They are part of you that condition you. They are your problem."</p><p>"That's called trauma. And I'm fine."</p><p>"If that was true, why didn't you plant your Sun and Moon Dew Flower seed?"</p><p>Shen Jiu frowns, not understanding what Mu Qingfang is referring to.</p><p>"Because I am consistent in my actions. Those seeds were our resource in the case facing Luo Binghe ended badly."</p><p>"In case you died. However, you decided to not plant them. You decided to die, Shen-shixiong. And I suspect it was because you believed that no one would miss you. Do you already understand what kind of disease you have?"</p><p>Shen Jiu raised his head, proud.</p><p>"I'm fine."</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Nine months have passed since Shen Yuan's self-destruction and Shen Jiu finally can understand that he is not fine, that his tiredness is not normal, nor his lack of concentration. And even though he's trying, he can't recover. The only thing that relieves him is talking to Mu Qingfang and ripping off weights that he wasn’t aware of.</p><p>"I will never tell anyone what we talked about."</p><p>"I know."</p><p>"Was what Qui Haitang told about your past as a slave and Wu Yanzi true?"</p><p>Shen Jiu takes a deep breath.</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Shen-shixiong, what do you think I'll do with that information?"</p><p>He frowns, confused, and looks at the healer.</p><p>"Others might call you a criminal, Shen-shixiong. Have you thought that I could betray you?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>Mu Qingfang smiles.</p><p>"That's good. See? You can trust other people. I will keep your secret just like I have kept the others. I will never use them against you, but to help you. I can understand that you have met horrible people and need to protect yourself, but you also need to find people you trust."</p><p>Lately, Mu Qingfang poisons him with a warm and pleasant hope, which Shen Jiu no longer rejects.</p><p>"Shen-shixiong, when Qiu Haitang accused you, Cang Qiong Mountain Sect came out to defend you. And we still didn't know the truth about Shen Yuan. We defended our martial brother. We did it once and we will do it again."</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Ten months after Shen Yuan's self-destruction and the same question.</p><p>"Shen-shixiong, how do you feel if I propose to go back to the sect?"</p><p>Uneasy. He has been in the palace for so long that the prospect of leaving the quiet makes him uncomfortable. As always, Mu Qingfang doesn’t pressure him, although he senses that this time he will not be able to run away so easily.</p><p>"Shen-shixiong, you've never had something to consider a home, have you? Could you give us a chance?"</p><p><em> You'd be better off without me. </em> Shen Jiu sighs. <em> I only bring you problems. </em></p><p>"Can we talk about another thing?"</p><p>"Shen-shixiong, you don't want to talk about Qi-Ge, or what happened with the Qiu or Wu Yanzi. I can understand it and I will not pressure you. But I am worried that despite so many months you insist on isolating yourself. Now I understand that you are imitating the same defensive attitude as in the past when we were disciples and rejected you because of our prejudices. But there is no reason why you should hide or protect yourself. "</p><p>Although he knows that Mu Qingfang is right, Shen Jiu cannot find the words to justify himself.</p><p>"You have been alone for a long time, Shen-shixiong."</p><p>"My disciples visit me. I have Luo Binghe."</p><p>"I’m also worried about Luo Binghe. You have improved, but he doesn’t even allow us to help him. The reasons why he isolates you are also disturbing." Mu Qingfang rubs his eyes, tired. "Maybe he does it because he confuses what you want with what you need. Or because he wants to keep you in control. Both options are possible."</p><p>"Maybe I’m weakened, but my former disciple has no control over me."</p><p>"If you decided to go back to the sect with me today, do you think Luo Binghe would allow it?"</p><p>Shen Jiu frowns and shakes his head.</p><p>"But he would if I explained that I'll come back later."</p><p>"Why should you return if he kidnapped you and kept you away from us during all this time?"</p><p>Although that is a truth that Shen Jiu has always been aware of, it is another one of those issues that he has preferred to ignore, like that Luo Binghe's problem was caused by him.</p><p>And so he must stay.</p><p>"I must stay with him to clear his meridians."</p><p>"For health reasons, you shouldn't do it, why hasn't he looked for anyone else?"</p><p>"What other human cultivator of high cultivation would offer to help him?"</p><p>"Myself. And I already offered, but he has always refused. That dependency between the two of you is a chain, Shen-shixiong. Perhaps you are comfortable with all his servants, but little chores like making your bed or cooking would help you." Mu Qingfang sighs, but his gaze doesn't soften. "This time I’m going to send you a mission: I want you to visit us this month. I will help you so that you feel comfortable and be able to advance in your treatment. But if you can’t do it, we’ll talk about it in our next session without any further evasion, understood?"</p><p>Shen Jiu reluctantly agrees. Mu Qingfang extends a hand and places it on top of his.</p><p>"And most importantly: if Luo Binghe prevents it or you notice that he controls you without letting you go free, you have to tell us. We can help you."</p><p>This time, Mu Qingfang leaves a different shadow for the questions’ echo. They both knew that to achieve such a simple mission, he must start by talking to Luo Binghe. And even though they have been together all those months, there is still an abyss between them that only closes a little when Shen Jiu cleans his meridians or he prepares food for the two of them. Luo Binghe is usually busy with his demonic conquests and he avoids it whenever he can for...</p><p>...fear. Even though he always tells Mu Qingfang that he is not a coward, fear paralyzes him. It is the fear of returning to the Cang Qiong Mountain Sect and discovering that nothing has changed despite his absence. The fear of facing painful truths or that he has any solution.</p><p>But as Mu Qingfang has taught him, Shen Jiu tries to control those parasitic thoughts and prevent them from multiplying. He locks them up so they can leave him alone. Right now, he should only care about his mission.</p><p>But he will wait for Luo Binghe to return. And then he will find the right time to talk to him. If not today, he will try tomorrow. Or the day after tomorrow. It's okay if he waits until he feels strong enough to do it.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Eleven months have passed since Shen Yuan's self-destruction and Shen Jiu waits for Mu Qingfang with his eyes closed, one arm on the table, and the other hand covering his face.</p><p>"Shen-shixiong?"</p><p>In the end, he was unable to try. He delayed it every day, just like the letters. Now he finally knows what the answer to Mu Qingfang's questions is: he is unable to return by himself.</p><p>"I need help.” He mutters with a broken voice. “Perhaps... I have a problem."</p>

<p>
<span>The worst pain is not from his broken bones, but his shattered pride.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge awakens on Qian Cao Peak, stunned by a mist trapped within his head. He can barely move and the noises confuse him. The last memories before he lost consciousness run through his mind like new blows.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He was defeated. Again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Yue Qingyuan enters the room, he has already sat on the bed, ignoring the fire burning in his muscles. The sect leader's gaze is cold and judges him without words. Liu Qingge clenches his teeth until his jaw hurts. Losing is painful and humiliating, but his leader's disappointment is even worse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yue Qingyuan sits in front of his bed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Why did you do it, shidi?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You wanted me to stay idly!?" Liu Qingge hisses. His throat is hoarse and his words are spun with groans. "You said I could wait until Mu-shixiong returned."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"That didn't mean you could disappear the same day."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"That monster has Shen Jiu locked up! And Shen Jiu is sick! He needs us!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I know," Yue Qingyuan closes his eyes and breathes. Weariness casts a shadow over the sect leader's features. "But now you have put us in a very difficult position. If you ever face Luo Binghe again, he will kill you."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Let him try," Liu Qingge growls, his left hand gripping the sheets so tightly that he almost tears them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shidi, you have been sleeping for two weeks and Mu-shidi is afraid of the sequelae of your arm. You must rest."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge hates his weakness and having Shen Jiu so far away, in a jail that he cannot access, but he also hates the passivity of the leader he wants to trust. Furious, he looks Yue Qingyuan into the eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"How long? Until Shen Yuan returns and Luo Binghe kidnaps him as well? Or until he injures Shen Jiu? How long should I wait, Zhangmen-shixiong?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although the frustration on his face is similar to his, Liu Qingge is tense with rage while Yue Qingyuan has been defeated by tired sadness. And without the need for words, he finds knows who has given up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Mu-shidi and I are working to get Shen-shidi back."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It's not enough."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Liu-shidi." And this time his voice is a warning. "Have you ever wondered why Shen-shixiong hasn't tried to escape if he's not locked up or unarmed?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"That beast has done something to him."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Mu-shidi has other theories." Yue Qingyuan sits up with his hands behind her back. "Rest, Liu-shidi. You are forbidden to leave Qian Cao Peak until your arm is healed."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"And what about Shen Jiu!?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Mu-shidi has negotiated with Luo Binghe. He has permission to visit Shen-shidi every month." Yue Qingyuan sighs. "Mu-shidi will also investigate what kind of illness affects Shen-shixiong and how to cure him."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge tries to get up, but his broken arm is a dead weight that burns every time he jerks around.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Is not enough."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Luo Binghe has already announced that he will take it as a sect attack next time. And an enemy that has defeated our War God is an enemy that we cannot afford as long as Shen-shidi's state is unstable."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge is left alone in a room that smells of spices and medicinal herbs. Although the sun warms through the window, he feels a chill that rises from under his skin. He rubs his eye with his left hand. But it's too late.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He has started crying.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge doesn't remember the last time he cried, but he also doesn't remember when he felt so useless and miserable. He's gotten used to being powerful, almost perfect, and now he's lost everything.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He is no longer the unbeatable War God that everyone admires, but the one who has lost against a demon.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The first time Shen Jiu cleared his meridians, Luo Binghe knew it was wrong.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But he is unable to stop shizun when he repeats it another night. His qi is soft like the breeze in a bamboo forest and calms the darkness inside his veins. Even so, Luo Binghe has a crooked smile whenever Shen Jiu takes his wrist. He's the one who swore to protect both shizuns but in the end…</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>You failed. </span>
</em>
<span>Xin Mo whispers to him.</span>
<em>
<span> You failed because you aren’t powerful enough. One is dead, the other will disappear. He will abandon you for the white cultivator. Kill him. Lock him up. Chain up your shizun and acclaim him as yours. Be the monster you want, be the monster that others fear. They are afraid of you, they will never accept you. So, KILL THEM.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu not only eases the chaos of his two natures, but it also silences the voice of the sword. Although Luo Binghe accepted exhaustion as a punishment for killing Shen Yuan, that small instant of comfort soothes his wounds. Sometimes when he fights to blood against demons, Luo Binghe feels good. He deserves a thousand times that pain and more if it will make Shen Yuan return. But it is when Shen Jiu takes his wrist and cleanses his meridians that the Demon Lord finally breathes without sorrow in his heart.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This is wrong. He is the one who should be powerful enough to protect his shizun. Luo Binghe hates his fragility, that moment when all his wishes are incomplete. But it's nice that Shen Jiu takes care of him. Pleasant and addictive. In the end, he closes his eyes and rests his head on his shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Someday he will protect his two shizuns and they will never be hurt again. Someday in the future...</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Xin Mo purrs. His voice may become an almost silent whisper, but it never disappears.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge is still not healed when one night he sneaks off Qian Cao Peak. Pain accompanies him with every step, but he has become used to ignoring it. After a month and a half of forced rest, he feels weak and fragile. He hates it. It's as if Luo Binghe not only broke his arm but the person he used to be.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before leaving the sect, he made a detour to Bai Zhan Peak to change his clothes and search for weapons and supplies which will help him to rescue Shen Jiu.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yue Qingyuan awaits him in front of the door of his house.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Although I'm not surprised, you still disappoint me, shidi."</span>
</p><p>
<span>His gaze is the same as the last time they spoke. Liu Qingge tenses when the sect leader walks up to him. Although he doesn’t distinguish intention to fight or drag him to Qian Cao Peak, he knows that he will prevent him from returning to the palace.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Follow me, shidi. I need to tell you something."</span>
</p><p>
<span>His voice is lower than usual. The Yue Qingyuan who walks beside him that night seems like a shadow, a stranger instead of his sect leader. Maybe it's the suspicion that has grown in his heart or the frustration that no one else shares his rage against the demon who killed Shen Yuan and kidnapped Shen Jiu.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They walk in silence to the Lingxi Caves. Liu Qingge pretends to not limp and that the pain is tolerable, even though every step is torture. He is not weak. The War God is not broken. So he swallows all the grunts and complaints as he follows his leader.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At night, the Lingxi Caves are a labyrinth of sinister shadows. Yue Qingyuan walks with the determination to have a clear goal while he feels cold memories in his gut. Enclosed within those walls reverberates the echo of his qi deviation and his first encounter with Shen Yuan. He saved his life even though Liu Qingge still believed that he was his enemy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Everything changed here.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yue Qingyuan takes him to a natural room carved out of the rock. It is wide and the spiritual energy is very powerful, although there are bloodstains on the walls. The sect leader places his hand on the stone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Once, when I was a disciple, I wanted to save someone very important to me."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge frowns, but intrigue encourages him to listen without interrupting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"That person was also trapped. He belonged to a wicked family, more cruel and heartless than some demons. I promised him that I would rescue him and tried to keep my promise. When I entered Qiong Ding Peak, I studied and trained day and night. I pressed all my limits and I went for a sword ahead of time. " Yue Qingyuan's voice has turned into a whisper broken by the pain of the memories. "I rushed too much. That person deserved it, but I only managed to put my life in danger. My shizun locked me here for a few years when I was caught in a qi deviation that almost killed me."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge is not stupid and understands the message of his story. That's why he looks away when Yue Qingyuan raises his head towards him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I've been a cripple since then."</span>
</p><p>
<span>That incomplete secret is bitter and freezes the air that reaches his lungs. Liu Qingge takes a deep breath, though his left hand unconsciously searches for his injured arm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I don't care."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shidi, let me finish my story." Yue Qingyuan smiles. And it is such a sad and defeated smile that something inside Liu Qingge trembles. "When I was finally able to leave the Lingxi Caves with my sword, I went for that person. But I only found the ashes of a house."</span>
</p><p>
<span>The sect leader turns his back on him and walks into the corridor they have come through with one hand stroking the stains on the walls.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I've been wondering for years what would have happened if I had made another decision," Yue Qingyuan confesses to him. "I also thought that it didn't matter if I got hurt, but in the end, I couldn't rescue him or prevent him from suffering something even worse."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge gulps and waits for the question that he knows will come now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shidi, what are you planning to do?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Rescue Shen Jiu."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yue Qingyuan smiles when he looks at him, still with that nostalgic sadness darkening his features.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"As I expected. Sorry, shidi."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge's eyes widen as he feels powerful qi shaking the cave and covering the walls in a bluish glow. He tries to run up to Yue Qingyuan, but he trips against a barrier that separates him from the exit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Zhangmen-shixiong!!!!" He screams as he punches the spirit energy. "Release me!!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You have left me with no other chance, shidi." Yue Qingyuan sighs with weariness, with compassion that Liu Qingge refuses to accept. "Dying or ending up crippled will only make Xiao Jiu even more miserable. I know that better than anyone." Although it is not the first time he hears that name, tonight Liu Qingge squints his eyes and glares at Yue Qingyuan. "You will stay here recovering. The rest of us will take care of Shen-shixiong."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don't you dare!" He hisses before hitting the wall again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And although all his efforts are futile, Liu Qingge tries desperately. It's the only thing left for him: his anger and despair. The rest are shards accumulated inside his chest that tear him apart with every beat, with every breath.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe is busy with so many pendant tasks that sometimes he feels like he is drowning in blood and ash, in the cold of a room covered in frost, in his unrealizable dreams. Then, Xin Mo's voice grows into a cruel scream.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But he has shizun.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Xin Mo has also tried to cast doubt on Shen Jiu. </span>
<em>
<span>He is cruel. He pushed you. He hates you for being a demon. He disgusts you for being a human. He wants to kill you for what you did to his brother. I know. </span>
</em>
<span>But all those doubts die every night Shizun cleans his meridians.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Shizun, forgive this disciple for being such an idiot, </span>
</em>
<span>he thinks as Shen Jiu's icy fingers brush against his skin.</span>
<em>
<span> I forgot that the kindness of the moon shines less than the sun, but it is just as beautiful.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe wants to help him too, but he still doesn't understand what happens to Shen Jiu. Mu Qingfang has explained to him that it is a dangerous sadness, a poison that has robbed him of his energy, determination, and the will to live.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although Luo Binghe hides many dark desires, for shizun's sake he listens to Mu Qingfang.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>"Have you told Shen-shidi what happened to Liu-shidi?" Yue Qingyuan asks Mu Qingfang before he goes to Luo Binghe's palace.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Not yet. I'm afraid that it will make him feel guilty."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"But maybe he never forgives Liu-shidi."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"For what? Being hurt?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yue Qingyuan sighs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Tell him when you think he can hear it without the truth hurting him. It’s okay if you put all the blame on me." His smile is sad. “He already hates me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge hates the loneliness of the Lingxi Caves. Sometimes they visit him: Mu Qingfang checks his wounds and tells him about Shen Jiu, Liu Mingyan keeps him company and Yue Qingyuan tries to talk to him, but it is not enough and his anger has grown to accuse his martial brothers of doing nothing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We have reforged Zheng Yang," Yue Qingyuan tells him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"That beast doesn't need a new sword."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We have made a list of places to look for Shen Yuan."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Why weren't you looking for him already?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>He doesn’t want to hear their news. And although Liu Qingge tries to meditate to recover sooner, his thoughts are in chaos. He is worried about everything that he doesn’t know, about those shadows that the sect cannot discover.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And loneliness is terrifying when days turn into months.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He is trying to meditate when he hears a meow. Liu Qingge opens his eyes and looks to his right. There is a white cat in the caves. It shouldn't be there, but he recognizes it: it's the twins' cat. The animal walks toward him. It has the same angry look as Shen Jiu and growls at him as he slaps his knee with a paw.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Where are they?" He seems to say with his meows. "Why have they abandoned me?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Sorry." Liu Qingge's voice breaks and he notices another storm in his throat. Ignoring his snorting and scratching, he hugs the animal and begins stroking its head. "I miss them too."</span>
</p><p>
<span>In the end, the cat sits on his lap. And even though he doesn't speak, his company makes him feel less alone.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>You're an Idiot.</span>
</em>
<span> Xin Mo whispers to him. </span>
<em>
<span>You have opened the doors of your palace to your enemies.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>From the distance, Luo Binghe gazes at the disciples who have come to visit Shen Jiu. They are a small group of four and although he hates that idea, Mu Qingfang has assured him that it is for his sake. So, he accepted. Even though the monster that lives within him roars with envy as tired smiles return to Shen Jiu's face and his eyes light up a bit. He also wants to make him so happy. Why doesn't he get it? Is he not enough?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe agreed to that plan with some conditions. Among them, Gongyi Xiao cannot return to his palace and all visits will be brief.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu gathers them in the gardens to tell them about their progress. Although Luo Binghe is busy, he continues to watch over them in the shadows. Suspicious of the Cang Qiong Mountain Sect's intentions although Mu Qingfang seemed sincere when he scolded him for isolating Shen Jiu.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe frowns. There is a girl that he doesn’t recognize. During the years that he was absent, he forced Shang Qinghua to keep him informed of the new disciples (possible rivals). If his shizuns had accepted such a beautiful young woman, he would know it. Furthermore, she doesn’t go with them, but instead, she sits aside to write in a notebook.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With suspicion in mind, Luo Binghe walks towards the stranger. A cruel, twisted smile escapes him. Dressed in the Qing Jing Peak uniform and without her veil, Liu Mingyan is almost unrecognizable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Long time no see, Liu-shijie," he says, stopping in front of her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Despite being discovered, Liu Mingyan doesn't seem concerned. She smiles at him like in the past. Luo Binghe extends a hand, demanding the notebook she writes in. Liu Mingyan hands it to him without hesitation.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She is a spy. KILL HER. KILL HER. KILL HER. Tear off her limbs and send them to her brother for playing dirty.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe frowns. There are no notes or plans written down in that notebook, but the description of a scene.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What is this?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I’m writing a novel, Lord Luo."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"A novel?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe chokes on turning the page and reading a very explicit scene of two men fucking in a palace garden. The terrible Demon Lord looks at the writer, who smiles with innocence and sweetness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don't say anything to Shen-shibo, please. I'm supposed to take care of his disciples, not engage in other pursuits."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe ignores her guilty expression, still staring at the pages of the notebook. He clears his throat, regaining his composure. And he turns to another page since he must make sure that there are no secret messages. He is not interested in the story, of course, nor in the details.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I didn't know what you wrote, Liu-shijie."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It's my little secret, Lord Luo."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It's a good story," he comments before handing her the notebook back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Do you like it?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe doesn't nod despite the curiosity that purrs along with all his hungry monsters.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Why are your protagonists a Demon Lord and an Immortal Master?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Coincidence, I guess." Liu Mingyan stands up when she sees that Shen Jiu is saying goodbye to his disciples. "Can I come back next week? I can't write this story in Cang Qiong Mountain Sect... for obvious reasons."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe turns his back on her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Only if I can read the rest later."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Sha Hualing is so disappointed that she would destroy something with her nails. Specifically, the veil that covers Liu Mingyan's face. Luo Binghe convinced her to keep an eye on the writer with the incentive that she had removed her veil, but that day she had come in her usual clothes.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Too bad</span>
</em>
<span>, laments the demoness. The beauty of that human is so legendary that the curiosity stings her nails.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She is so distracted writing that it would be easy to snatch the veil, but Luo Binghe is inexplicably interested in her novel and Sha Hualing doesn’t dare to disturb him. Intrigued, she sits next to Liu Mingyan to read over his shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh."</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>"You are a bunch of cowards," Liu Qingge hisses while Mu Qingfang examines his arm. Although it no longer hurts, the healer insists on checking him almost daily for fear that he may not be able to move it as before. "It's been half a year since that beast kidnapped Shen Jiu. And he's still locked up."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I'm afraid that Shen-shixiong doesn't want to come back."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I don’t believe it."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"He is neither bound nor unarmed, Liu-shidi."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"That beast must have used hypnosis or demonic tricks!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mu Qingfang sighs. Behind him, Yue Qingyuan is tense and uncomfortable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I wish it were that simple, Liu-shidi, but it is Shen-shixiong himself who has chosen the palace. Although we are making progress, there is still much that I still don’t know about his fears."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shen Jiu is not a coward," he growls.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We all have fears, Liu-shidi. And his are the reason why he is so tired. Sometimes, some monsters live inside our heads and we cannot defeat them with a sword."</span>
</p><p>
<span>He frowns. And although he finds it difficult to accept that idea, Liu Qingge thinks of the frustration that prevents him from sleeping or the poisoned memory of his fighting against Luo Binghe. Perhaps he can understand Mu Qingfang's words, although that doesn’t reassure him, but rather worries him even more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Why? What happened to Shen Jiu?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>All of his monsters have been born from terrible situations that have left him different scars. Shen Jiu's must be similar. Liu Qingge trembles, angry and worried, at the possibility that Luo Binghe has hurt him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I don't know, but I suspect it happened a long time ago, perhaps during his childhood, and still hasn't recovered."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge frowns and looks at him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What exactly are you talking about? What do you know?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I can't tell you, Liu-shidi."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Why not!? I want to help Shen Jiu too!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Because it has been very difficult to regain his trust and I cannot lose it."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I won’t say anything."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shidi," Yue Qingyuan reproaches him, breaking his silence. "Don't be impatient and listen to Mu-shidi. Shen-shidi is an extremely distrustful person. Perhaps right now, he only trusts Shen-ershidi. Betraying his trust is a worse crime than abandoning him."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Neither speaks for the next few minutes in which Mu Qingfang applies a balm to his shoulder joint to ensure proper recovery.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Furthermore, we have another problem with Luo Binghe," he mutters cautiously, glancing at Yue Qingyuan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge stiffens.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What has he done now?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Nothing. It has been almost seven months since he attacked us and since then he has not been aggressive against humans. Our guards report that he has simply refurbished the palace and the former members of the sect now work for him. We know for sure that the elders were killed. And perhaps the Old Palace Master, who is missing." Mu Qingfang keeps his medicine away and Liu Qingge dons his outer robes again. "The only madness he is trying to commit is to resurrect Shen-ershixiong. But despite that, he pampers Shen-shixiong and has never stopped me from moving forward with the treatment."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"He's still holding him prisoner," Liu Qingge growls without hiding his hatred.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I know."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What is the problem, shidi?" Yue Qingyuan intervenes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I suspect that he is holding on to Shen-shixiong to keep calm. Right now, Luo Binghe is a volcano that can erupt at any moment." He explains to them. "Shen-ershixiong's death has affected him and he is still not over it. The dual nature of his qi is dangerous and he only forces his limits instead of controlling them. Furthermore, that damn sword affects his most visceral emotions, like anger or desire. "</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge punches the wall.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"And that's why we must get him away from Shen Jiu!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"However, despite my fears, Luo Binghe is controlled. Shen-shixiong is the reason that keeps him stable. If we separate them, I fear that all of his inner demons will get out of control."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I don't care," Liu Qingge hisses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That would give him an excuse to face him again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Even if that puts Shen-shixiong in danger?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>His answer leaves Liu Qingge speechless for a few seconds.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"He is already in danger. Luo Binghe is not stupid and knows the benefits of dual cultivation. That unfilial beast desires his masters." Liu Qingge turns to Yue Qingyuan and bows his head. "Please. I'm recovered now. Let me out."</span>
</p><p>
<span>The sect leader hesitates.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Not yet."</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>"For the next chapter, I was thinking that the Demon Lord's rival might enter the Immortal Master's room at night."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Luo Binghe will kill you if you write that."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"The Demon Lord will arrive on time, don't worry." The human has a mischievous laugh that reminds her of a succubus. "Then they will fight and the Demon Lord will claim the Immortal Master as a trophy. Readers want tension and drama!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It's still a bad idea, but I suspect he'll like it, so..." She shrugs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I have several ideas, can you advise me?" Liu Mingyan is so close to her that her shoulders touch. Maybe she's smiling, but Sha Hualing can't tell because of that stupid veil. "I was thinking of writing the scene from the point of view of the love rival. He is a new character and that will surprise the readers. Also, it will be spicier if he sees how the Demon Lord fucks the Immortal Master."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You have terrible ideas for being human."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Thank you. Do you think the scene is realistic if the rival faces the guards first?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No, he will alert everyone before reaching the Immortal's room. I would suggest you..."</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Shizun sighs while cleaning his meridians. Luo Binghe contemplates him. Mu Qingfang's latest visit has left him more stressed than usual. Although during those almost ten months the healer has managed to mend the broken pieces of Shen Jiu, this is the first time that he seems restless. Shen Jiu bites his lip. Luo Binghe has the feeling that he wants to say something to him, but in the end, he never speaks and he doesn't insist either.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Done." He clicks his tongue as he releases his wrist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As always, giving him spiritual energy leaves him exhausted. Even so, he always refuses his help when they get up. It's frustrating. He would like to make up for the kindness of his shizun, even if it is to pick him up and carry him to his room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You can't stay like this forever, Luo Binghe," Shen Jiu tells him as he walks to the door. "You should find a cultivation partner."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Despite the rejection, the Demon Lord smiles.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"But I only want shizun."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu turns to look at him with disdain similar to the past and that still makes him shiver.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don't be ridiculous. First, I hope you haven't forgotten that I am not Shen Yuan. Second, I will never allow you to get close to my brother again when he returns."</span>
</p><p>
<span>This is the most important comfort that Shen Jiu gives him. Not the warm that cleanses his body of tainted qi and bloody weighings. Not his company when they eat together. Not the fact that he doesn't abandon him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu is the only person in the entire world who also believes that Shen Yuan will return. And that gives Luo Binghe the strength to continue perfecting the resurrection spell. They share the same hope and dream of the same future.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>The time inside the Lingxi Caves is reminiscent of a fuzzy dream. Liu Qingge has been locked up with the sole company of a grumpy cat for so long that when Yue Qingyuan voids the seal, he is left paralyzed and confused.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The first breath of air when leaving tastes like freedom.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Of course, he draws Cheng Luan to fly after Shen Jiu. However, Yue Qingyuan grabs him by the neck of the outer robes and drags him to Qiong Ding Peak.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Let me go!" Liu Qingge hisses. "You told me that Shen Jiu has asked us for help!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Should I remind you of Luo Binghe's threats?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>He grits his teeth, furious, but for once he doesn't answer: "I don't care." Instead, he growls and reluctantly follows the sect leader into the meeting room. All the Peak Lords are already reunited, but also his sister.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Surprised, he gazes at Liu Mingyan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What are you doing here?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Helping you, Ge. While you were recovering, this humble one walked inside Luo Binghe's castle. I know all its entrances and weak points, where Shen-shibo's room is, and the best way to get there without being discovered."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We have a plan, shidi," Yue Qingyuan explains. "We are going to rescue Shen-shixiong. But this time you will be discreet. This sect will never abandon its own, but neither will allow anyone to sacrifice themselves in vain anymore."</span>

<p>His heartbeat swells when Liu Qingge and his sister leave Cang Qiong Mountain Sect. Although impatience bites into his guts and legs, his steps are hesitant. Liu Qingge still feels that he is dreaming. The world outside the Lingxi Caves is too intense and bright, dizzying. He closes his eyes and takes a deep breath before unsheathing Cheng Luan.</p><p>"Ge, are you okay?"</p><p>Liu Qingge growls, although he no longer remembers when he was at peace for the last time. A year of tension and uncertainty, of anger and frustration, is too much and has worn him out on the inside.</p><p>"I'll be fine when we rescue Shen Jiu."</p><p>His sister nods at him. Her eyes sparkle when she unsheathes Shui Se.</p><p>"Let's go."</p><p>It feels like an eternity since the last time Liu Qingge headed to Luo Binghe's palace. His right shoulder burns in memory of his defeat. Liu Qingge frowns and accelerates the flight. In recent months, Yue Qingyuan and Mu Qingfang have taught him to be patient. And he's trying, but it's been a long time without him feeling alive. His blood boils with the desire to fight, to keep moving, and never stop again.</p><p>But for Shen Jiu's sake, he stays behind Liu Mingyan.</p><p>There are several protective arrays within the Bailu forest, but his sister knows how to get through them. When he asks her, she shrugs and mutters: "Chapter 24."</p><p>After sheathing their swords, they walk to the palace. Liu Mingyan scolds him whenever he makes unnecessary or too loud noises. The key to his plan is stealth and surprise. And although in other circumstances Liu Qingge would say that it is a dishonorable plan, on this occasion he doesn’t hesitate to follow all of her indications.</p><p>Liu Mingyan also knows which wall is the most unprotected and how to reach the palace. She prevents him from getting into fights by distinguishing soldiers and servants but instead dodges them like cowardly rats.</p><p>As they advance, Liu Qingge gazes at the past Huan Hua Palace. The sect has disappeared, replaced by the home of a demon emperor. <em> Despite what Mu-shidi says, that beast is up to something. </em> Liu Qingge grits his teeth, wanting to eradicate that place with fire.</p><p>Shen Jiu's room is at the end of a maze of pavilions, courtyards, and guard posts. As they get closer, Liu Qingge's heart races with impatience and longing, but also restlessness. He is under the impression that Luo Binghe will appear from around every corner. All shadows have his demonic sigil and silence can hide his cruel voice.</p><p>And perhaps he wishes to meet him again to turn all his rage into a mortal fight.</p><p>"If you go straight ahead, you will find Shen-shibo," Liu Mingyan whispers to him.</p><p>Liu Qingge nods. Before leaving, they discussed the plan. Liu Mingyan didn’t go into details but promised that she would keep one of Luo Binghe's demon generals distracted. When his sister disappears, he sneaks into the room.</p><p>His pulse trembles when he finally opens the door.</p><p>Shen Jiu is reading a letter and is slow to look up. But when he sees him, his eyes widen in surprise. Shen Jiu lets out a strangled sound as he enters the room and walks, almost running, towards him.</p><p>"Shidi? What are you doing here?"</p><p>It's been so long that he almost forgot his voice. And although it sounds cold there are hints of relief or perhaps curiosity. Liu Qingge's heart constricts. Shen Jiu's skin glows with paleness, and exhaustion stains his usual beauty. Instead of wearing his Peak Lord robes, his clothing is luxurious and elegant, with red and black decorating the green. Shen Jiu gasps like a cat when he carries him in his arms.</p><p>"I've come for you. We're leaving."</p><p>Liu Qingge can feel that he is tense. His nails dig into him instinctively, but those few words make Shen Jiu squeeze his eyes shut and cling to him. Liu Qingge is aware of his racing pulse, but the only response he receives is silence.</p><p>After retrieving Xiu Ya, Liu Qingge leaves that room without stopping or looking back. The hardest part is escaping the palace without being discovered. Liu Mingyan has repeated it to him a thousand times: he cannot let them to see them or Luo Binghe will appear and they will miss a unique opportunity. "You won't just be defeated," she warned him with sharp seriousness. "Right now Shen-shibo is barely vigilant. If we fail, maybe even Mu Qingfang won't be able to see him again. Don't seek him out for revenge or fight him, understand?"</p><p>Liu Qingge takes a deep breath and follows his sister's instructions. With each step, he accelerates. Until the forest devours them. Until they return under the blue sky and he can unsheathe Cheng Luan.</p><p>Shen Jiu wriggles in his arms as he climbs onto the sword.</p><p>"You can let me go now, shidi."</p><p>"No."</p><p>He will never let go of him again.</p><p> </p><p>
<img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/02a51d40e784f950103256d75ff19fe5/f74a73a60e7391fd-4a/s2048x3072/774da7070abd69a28fea8b3b8b0d83f092bba6bc.jpg" alt width="816" height="1125" />
</p><p> </p><p>Shen Jiu shrugs. And that indifference is terrifying and odd in him. Until that moment, Liu Qingge hadn’t understood what Mu Qingfang was referring to when he tried to explain to him that Shen Jiu is unwell. Liu Qingge hugs him tighter.</p><p>Shen Jiu falls asleep on their way to Cang Qiong Mountain Sect.</p><p>Everyone is gathered at the entrance of the sect. There are cheers and relief when Liu Qingge lands with Shen Jiu in his arms, who meows in his sleep. His eyebrows are twisted and he has one of his characterístic grimaces. Liu Qingge sighs, though a tiny smile escapes his.</p><p>He had missed him. He had missed his presence at Qing Jing Peak, his sarcastic complaints and comments, his stubbornness.</p><p>Shen Jiu's disciples surround Liu Qingge. They look like a bunch of ducklings. Although he never wants to let go of him again, Liu Qingge allows Gongyi Xiao to take his shizun and carry him to Qing Jing Peak to rest.</p><p>"So noisy..." Shen Jiu splutters, his eyes still closed when Liu Qingge turns away from him.</p><p>Later, he will return to his side, but now Liu Qingge needs to be reunited with the other Peak Lords.</p><p>"Well done, shidi," Yue Qingyuan congratulates him with a smile that doesn't hide the concern from his eyes.</p><p>He's not the only one. Almost everyone watches the sky expectantly. Luo Binghe will appear at any moment. It is a certainty that Liu Qingge notices in his chest, inside his lungs.</p><p>"I'm still afraid that I made a mistake," Mu Qingfang sighs.</p><p>"It was the best option." Qi Qingqi and Liu Qingge belong to the action, while Mu Qingfang or Yue Qingyuan have defended patience and dialogue. "Shen-shixiong asked us for help. Talking to Luo Binghe wouldn’t have guaranteed anything. In the worst case, he would further shield his strength or take his shizun to the Demonic Realm."</p><p>"I know." He sighs. "But let me talk to him first."</p><p>Liu Qingge reluctantly nods. That is the agreement they had reached: after rescuing Shen Jiu, Mu Qingfang will try to explain to Luo Binghe why they have done it.</p><p>If Luo Binghe responds with violence or tries to kidnap Shen Jiu again, Liu Qingge and Yue Qingyuan will confront him.</p><p>As the disciples return to the interior of the sect, almost all the Peak Lords stand at the entrance, ready to defend their home and theirs from that demonic and unpredictable shadow that has drowned them for so long.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Shen Jiu rubs his temples. Why after many empty nights has he just fallen asleep in Liu Qingge's arms? And he still notices that heavy dream flooding his head and muddying his thoughts. The laughing voices of his disciples only make him even dizzier. After a frozen eternity, he is confused and his heart beats in terror. Everything has happened too fast. And without the security of the palace, he feels vulnerable.</p><p>"This master needs to rest," he growls.</p><p>Only tiredness prevents shame from destroying his self-control. He has fallen asleep. In Liu Qingge's arms. Everyone has seen him. And now his disciples are leading him into HIS home as if he is made of glass. Shen Jiu shakes his sleeves until the others take a few steps back. And he breathes a sigh of relief when they stop suffocating him with their closeness.</p><p>There are too many voices, too many people around him, too many unanswered questions. Why has Liu Qingge, precisely him, come? Why didn't he arrive earlier? Was he busy looking for Shen Yuan?</p><p>Shen Jiu flees home and locks himself inside. With his eyes closed, he leans his back against the door. Luckily, he will be able to rest a bit before facing the others again...</p><p>But he is never lucky.</p><p>"Jiu Bro!!!!"</p><p>Shen Jiu growls.</p><p>"The most useless spy in the world," he snorts, "What are you doing in MY HOUSE?"</p><p>That cowardly rat is sitting at his table. Or he was sitting at his table. Shang Qinghua jumps up and gets up, though he keeps pestering him with his nervous little voice.</p><p>"We've missed you, Jiu Bro! It's a relief to see you well and alive. I already thought Cucumber Bro would kill me after my son ripped your limbs off."</p><p>"I'm not in the mood to listen to your nonsense." Shen Jiu crawls up to the table and drops down.</p><p>He doesn't understand why he's still somnolent after having slept so long. Despite his efforts, Shen Jiu still feels weak and tired. His gaze contemplates his house. After a year of absence, he is surprised to find that there is no dust. The interior is clean and tidy, although too cold. It no longer smells of food or ink, but of emptiness.</p><p>"What do you want?" He growls at Shang Qinghua, suspicious of his presence.</p><p>"I have to talk to you, Jiu Bro!" Shang Qinghua sits in front of him. Although Shen Jiu should be used to his impatience by now, he seems more nervous than usual today. "Listen carefully to me, Jiu Bro. I've already found out what happened to Cucumber Bro."</p><p>Immediately, Shen Jiu opens his eyes and his weariness disappears, replaced by an expectant tension and fear that has grown in the last year.</p><p>"Speaks." His order sounds harsh.</p><p>"Do you remember when you planted the seeds?"</p><p>"Of course."</p><p>"Was it by any chance in the same year that you pushed Luo Binghe into the Endless Abyss?"</p><p>Shen Jiu frowns, but he nods. To his surprise, Shang Qinghua sighs. And his smile no longer seems so irritating, but relieves him, because the spy's concern is real.</p><p>"This is what I think happened. You planted the seeds to have a spare body in case Luo Binghe made other more drastic decisions than kidnapping the two of you. Although I still don't understand how you managed to seduce my son... Ouch! " Shen Jiu throws him a fan that he finds handy. "That Luo Binghe dreams of a harem doesn't surprise me, but with both of you? I mean, it's better than your original destiny, but the demonic pillar... Ouch! That hurt, Jiu Bro!"</p><p>"Stop babbling," he hisses at him. "Tell me what you know."</p><p>"Okay! Okay! Do you remember that Luo Binghe should be back in five years?"</p><p>Shen Jiu frowns. He will never understand how someone as irrelevant as Shang Qinghua possesses knowledge of such concrete details.</p><p>"Indeed."</p><p>"But Luo Binghe returned two years earlier than planned! Cucumber Bro assumed you would have five years for the seeds to grow. Five years, Jiu Bro, not three. Do you understand now?"</p><p>His eyes widen and his breathing almost stops.</p><p>"You mean... His body wasn't ready when A-Yuan self-destructed?"</p><p>"Exactly! A tree takes time to grow, right? The body would be ready in five years, not three."</p><p>"And what does that mean?" His voice trembles and he doesn't dare to utter the full question.</p><p>Not understanding his panic, Shang Qinghua giggled a hand.</p><p>"Easy: his soul is trapped in an incomplete body. For Cucumber Bro, these years will happen in the blink of an eye. He will surely wake up when the body is ready."</p><p>And it's been a year now, which means...</p><p>"A-Yuan will be back in a year," Shen Jiu mutters with his heart stuck in his throat.</p><p>He rests his forehead against one hand as he sighs. And he lets out a dry laugh. His shoulders tremble, Shen Jiu feels that his bones are going to collapse.</p><p><em> Why have I been such an idiot? A-Yuan was able to leave long ago, so why did I distrust him? </em>He blinks at the tears welling up in his eyes. Mu Qingfang was right when he warned him that his mistrust is harmful, that it blinds him, obscuring reality until it distorts it.</p><p>And then, raging darkness covers Cang Qiong Mountain Sect. And although he cannot see him, although they are both far away, Shen Jiu shivers.</p><p>Luo Binghe has arrived.</p>

<span>Fear intertwines with dark qi when Luo Binghe arrives at Cang Qiong Mountain Sect. Xin Mo taunts him with a metallic laugh. They both know that the last time one shizun died. But he has lost the other and Luo Binghe won't stop until he gets him back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His steps are slow but determined. The demon's heart beats in anticipation of smashing and killing, of eradicating this sect of thieves and traitors. The promises whispered by the sword that day sound sweeter. Luo Binghe squints as he recognizes the Peak Lords in front of the sect's entrance. They are waiting for him. Of course, they are waiting for him. They knew that he would return for his shizun, just as they should know the consequences for betraying him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Even so, Luo Binghe hasn't brought his army... yet. He will offer them one last chance. Xin Mo laughs, calling him naive and useless, soft-hearted, and a loser. It is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore the insults of the sword. And when he lifts his head and his gaze meets Liu Qingge's, he seems to read those same insults on his proud expression. Arrogant. Satisfied. Because he has beaten him with tricks and deceptions.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe will not destroy Cang Qiong Mountain Sect for the sake of his two shizuns, but he wishes to demolish the twelve peaks and bury its name in the mud. And he might if they insist on war.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The fault will be theirs and none shizun could blame him, right?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mu Qingfang has the guts to dare to step forward and welcome him. Although the healer is visibly nervous, he bows his head with the same respect as in his palace. A mockery. Behind him, the others remain tense and Liu Qingge has one hand on Cheng Luan's hilt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Lord Luo."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Where is shizun?" He growls. In his voice burns fire and hatred, but also fear that he tries to hide.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe needs to get Shen Jiu back and protect him. He will lock him in a room that no one else will be able to enter, perhaps deep within the Demonic Realm. Shizun will drink his blood and they will be chained forever, he will not need the help of a lying healer either, as his blood will heal his wounds.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And when Shen Yuan comes back to life, Shen Jiu will smile again and the three of them will be happy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>FOREVER.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe is a master of dreams, to imagine and create them. After surviving the Endless Abyss and crowning himself Emperor of Demons, there is no longer an impossible goal for him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shen-shixiong asked us to return to Cang Qiong Mountain Sect."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe clenches his fists tightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You're lying."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No. Shen-shixiong's recovery is delicate and he needs the support of his sect. He has been isolating himself for the past year."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"That's not true. He has me."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"He needs more people."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"There's no need."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because humans can be worse than demons, that was the warning his shizun gave him when he was younger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Lord Luo," Mu Qingfang interferes in a deep voice. "We are his martial family and we also want to take care of him. Shen-shixiong needs to regain his routine. Although I know you want to take care of him, that overprotection is hurting him."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because he only knows how to hurt and destroy, right? Like Shen Yuan, who died because of him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What's the problem with Shen-shixiong returning to his house?" Mu Qingfang continues and every one of his words pierces him. "You are his disciple, you can visit him as long as your intentions for the sect and our shixiong are peaceful."</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Luo Binghe needs his shizun or loneliness will grow like night and turn his palace into an icy grave.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Why are you listening to him? He mocks you even though he calls you lord. You should conquer them! If the sect belongs to you, your shizun will also be yours wherever he is.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>That is the perfect solution. Luo Binghe notices the temptation in the knuckles, in the eyes that glow like freshly spilled blood, in the urge to swing the sword and feed Xin Mo with the cries of those traitors.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"How can I trust you, Mu-shishu?" Luo Binghe draws a crooked smile. "You never informed me of this change. You haven't rescued shizun, you stole him when I was distracted. You have betrayed my trust..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shen Jiu is a person, not an object." Liu Qingge intervenes, interrupting him, and Luo Binghe's hatred burns when his gaze meets his rival's. "We didn't steal him, it was you who kidnapped him first."</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Liu-shidi...” Mu Qingfang warns him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe takes a step forward. His hand seeks Xin Mo's hilt, mirroring Liu Qingge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You are an ungrateful human. I have forgiven you twice despite all my threats. And unlike you, I keep my word."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Much to his regret, he cannot kill Liu Qingge despite that cruel and petty desire that he feels whenever they meet. Liu Qingge is (sadly) important to both shizuns, but...</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>...you can tear him into a thousand pieces. Rip off his legs and he won't return for your shizun again. Tear off his arms and he will never fight again. Gouge out his eyes and he will never look at your shizun again. Tear his tongue out and he will never challenge you again. You don't have to kill a man to destroy his legend.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>As if he could read his mind, Liu Qingge stiffens, his posture ready to attack even though he still hasn't drawn his sword.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Stop, both of you!" Mu Qingfang hisses, though uneasiness has made him pale. "If you appreciate Shen-shixiong, stop fighting and listen to me."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"There is nothing to hear." Although Luo Binghe addresses everyone, his gaze is fixed on Liu Qingge. "You have betrayed my trust. Give me back my shizun or Cang Qiong Mountain Sect will disappear tomorrow."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Never."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge doesn't even wait for the sect leader's response and steps forward with iron arrogance. As if all of his defeats were just a bad dream and he had a chance to face Luo Binghe and win.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This time...</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>KILL HIM. KILL HIM. TORTURE HIM. MUTILATE HIM. KILL HIM. TORTURE. MUTILATE. KILL. TORTURE. MUTILATE. KILL. TORTURE. MUTILATE. KILL. TORTURE. MUTILATE. KILL.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>This time he will lock that annoying human in the worst prison in the Demonic Realm until his shizuns forget about him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They attack at the same time. Mu Qingfang yells something, restless and desperate, just as the steel of both swords collide. The two look into each other's eyes for a few seconds, sharing the same hatred. And Xin Mo beats happily in his hands, hungry for blood. The sword moves almost by itself, seeking the cultivator's flesh to pierce through.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The other Peak Lords, minus Yue Qingyuan, fall back to dodge the aggressive waves of qi that shake the earth and the bamboo trees. The sect leader has one hand on his sword.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Stop!" He orders them. "Shidi, come back immediately."</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Liu Qingge grits his teeth and resists, perhaps sensing that Luo Binghe is tired of forgiving him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Lord Luo! Are you going to ignore that it was Shen-shixiong who wanted to be here?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>That's a lie. His shizun is helping him to control his qi and fuels his hopes when his dream of resurrecting Shen Yuan falters. Shizun keeps him company and Luo Binghe watches over him from the shadows until the day he gains his trust. Shizun has never tried to abandon him, it has always been them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They have put those ideas into Shen Jiu's head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Perhaps even the disease is a lie. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Maybe they are the ones who have made him sick.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They are dangerous.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Must.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Disappear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Stop!" Someone yells.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Luo Binghe no longer listens to anyone. He fights with all of his might, seeking not only defeat but Liu Qingge’s submission. When he falls, nothing will stand between him and his shizun.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After exchanging several ferocious blows, Luo Binghe discovers that his opponent's right arm is weaker. So he pursues that side of him, although Liu Qingge tries to dodge him, aware of his weakness. But that arm trembles every time Luo Binghe hits him and he lacks the strength to counterattack.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Please! Listen to me!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>The demonic sigil on his forehead flashes as he claws victory, pushing his rival into inevitable defeat. Liu Qingge hisses in pain when Xin Mo manages to cut his shoulder, but he moves fast and a serious wound remains a scratch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"IT'S ABOUT SHEN JIU!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>The steels stop in one last bite that releases a wave of qi. And although their swords are still intertwined, the two turn their heads. Shang Qinghua just appeared in front of the door. He trembles like a little mouse, wringing his hands and pale as snow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shen Jiu is gone!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge stumbles as Luo Binghe's eyes widen. In his chest beats the hope that Shen Jiu has returned to his palace.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Where? How?" Liu Qingge turns his back on his rival and furiously walks towards Shang Qinghua, who is screaming pathetically. "WHEN? You were supposed to watch him!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"But he wanted to leave!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No one has seen him leave the sect," Qi Qingqi observes. The other Peak Lords, despite the safe distance, is still there. Their gazes watch over both Luo Binghe and Shang Qinghua.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shen Jiu knows secret ways. He..." Shang Qinghua clears his throat. "He used them to sneak out of the sect secretly."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe doesn't know what he is referring to, only that the others seem uncomfortable and Mu Qingfang has paled. The healer is the first to rush into the sect, followed by Liu Qingge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Without shizun, it makes no sense for him to stay there, although his resentment against Cang Qiong Mountain Sect doesn’t disappear when Luo Binghe opens a portal back to the palace.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He will wait while he makes a decision. Just in case, Luo Binghe invokes Sha Hualing. The demoness appears disheveled and with makeup marks on her neck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Gather your troops. Shizun has left Cang Qiong Mountain Sect. Find him and escort him to the palace." Luo Binghe pauses. "The demonic palace."</span>
</p><p>
<span>This strength still needs to be perfected. It will be safer if both shizuns stay in his other home. Sha Hualing leaves after a nervous bow, and Luo Binghe enters his palace to prepare for the transfer of Shen Yuan's inert body to the Demonic Realm. A tense calm surrounds Luo Binghe. Not even his servants dare to make any noise. The tranquility of their Demon Lord is fragile as glass. And they all wait for the moment when it will explode into sharp and deadly shards.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The night falls. And cold covers the rooms of the palace. Sha Hualing returns head down and he smells fear in his general. She has failed. Luo Binghe clasps his hands behind his back. Despite the distance between them, he can feel her pulse rapid like a bird's.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Where is shizun?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>She throws herself to the ground.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Master Shen is missing!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe takes a deep breath. His control melts into threads.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Cang Qiong Mountain Sect?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>The demoness shakes her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"They're looking for him too. That cultivator Liu has organized several search teams."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fear eats his guts, freezes his bones, and hurts his heart. Luo Binghe digs his nails into his skin as he tries to keep calm. He already lost one shizun, he won't lose the other.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We will find him before Cang Qiong Mountain Sect," he orders. "Look for that useless spy. I want him to keep an eye on Cang Qiong Mountain Sect's every move. Also, search for rumors in the Demonic Realm."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe has collected many enemies in recent years. Perhaps they have caught Shen Jiu and plan to harm him or hold him hostage. Xin Mo purrs at the idea and Luo Binghe promises that he will hand over anyone who has dared to kidnap his shizun.</span>
</p><p>
<span>While Sha Hualing looks for Shen Jiu and Mobei-jun protects Shen Yuan while transporting him to the demon palace, Luo Binghe returns to his room. And on his bed of icy sheets, he closes his eyes to use his dreaming abilities and search the mind of his shizun.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Many months have passed since he last tried. Luo Binghe frowns. He can't find him. Shen Jiu's consciousness is mute and he cannot summon him even with a false dream. A bitter taste slides down his throat as he insists over and over again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Someone has blocked his mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Or shizun has forbidden him to enter inside his head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dawn slides across the sky after a night in which the calm has gradually cracked. Humans and demons are searching for the missing cultivator. There are no rumors. He is also not hiding in the sect. Luo Binghe's enemies stay in their hiding places and laugh without acknowledging the authorship of the disappearance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shizun is not there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before he had two, now none.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan is frozen like a corpse and Shen Jiu can no longer warm his hope or repair his meridians. The venom in Xin Mo's voice tinged his eyes with despair. He must find his shizun. If he is hurt, he will heal him. If he is dead, he will resurrect him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But he must find him soon, before anyone else. Either the humans will burn his body or they will keep whispering more lies. Or the demons will eat his corpse and send their pieces to him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It's all Cang Qiong Mountain Sect's fault. They kidnapped him. They broke his promises, betrayed his word, made him lower his guard with promises of cooperation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Everything is the fault of the rebellious demons, of that rotten world, of the thousand fronts that he has open and that he can no longer control.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Maybe... it's his fault too.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Have you already noticed? Your shizun is running away from you. No one has kidnapped him, he abandoned the sect he has hidden. You should have given him your blood when you could.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>His breathing is ragged. Luo Binghe's chest aches, as if all the shards of that broken peace have sunk into his heart. Stupid. He has been stupid and naive. Shizun has abandoned him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But he has Shen Yuan, why doesn't shizun come back?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Why has shizun abandoned his sect as well?</span>
</p><p>
<span>There must be something else, right?</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Where are you? </span>
</em>
<span>Luo Binghe thinks, suffocated by stress.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shizun must be injured and that's why he doesn't come back.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Idiot. Your shizun has fooled all of you. He learned to protect his mind from your powers and used cultivators to distract you. Don't you see the evidence? Your shizun is cunning, a dangerous animal, not an adorable kitten. You should have tamed him, chained him up, and made him love you. And I can help you.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe covers his face with both hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And he yeLLS UNTIL HIS THROAT HURT.</span>
</p><p>
<span>
<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FDh1YHYXEAENiY5?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" alt width="588" height="702" />
</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A week has passed and shizun is still missing. Sha Hualing says that none of his enemies have made any moves and the cultivators have also found no signs of demons nearby. Shang Qinghua assures him, trembling and in a shrill voice, that it was Shen Jiu who decided to leave and even prepared a bag with supplies. Mobei-jun warns him that if he continues to waste his power in preserving Shen Yuan's body in the end his qi will spiral out of control.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Xin Mo talks nonstop, whispers to him at night, his screams echoing inside his head. His voice is increasingly tempting and dangerous, a sweet promise to erase all his worries.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Mobilize the army," Luo Binghe orders his generals, gather in his war room. "If shizun is running, I'll make him come back."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Will we attack Cang Qiong Mountain Sect?" Shang Qinghua, the useless spy, asks almost hidden behind Mobei-jun's bulk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Luo Binghe smirks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No. Catch all the monsters and send out all the rogue demons. Let them face my enemies. I will weaken them without wasting my strength." The Demon Lord contemplates the map spread out on the table. "We will start to conquer the Human Realm."</span>
</p><p>
<span>And shizun will no longer be able to hide anywhere.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Someone knocks on the door and enters a former disciple of the Huan Hua Palace who decided to switch sides and serve him. The human kneels.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"My Lord, Xiao Gongzhu has returned with the woman you were looking for."</span>

<p>Luo Binghe's facade is fragile like cracked glass. The demon holds all his fragments behind an empty expression when he goes with Qiu Haitang. She will only see the darkness from several days of fruitless searching, his fear turned into a rage instead of insecurity, his weak and trembling heart after being abandoned by shizun again.</p><p>Qui Haitang awaits him along with Xiao Gongzhu. One of the women looks restless and nervous, the other proud. Luo Binghe watches them as Xin Mo tempts him with sweet murders. One accused Shen Jiu, the other wounded Shen Yuan. Perhaps both are the reason why his shizun has left and is not coming back.</p><p>No one will miss them if they disappear.</p><p>"Go away," he ordered Xiao Gongzhu with a voice hoarse and sharp as his sword.</p><p>Perhaps he roughly expels her because she is dangerous and selfish and should not listen to his conversation with Qiu Haitang. Or maybe because Luo Binghe knows that he wishes to hurt her. No excuses, just for the pleasure of breaking bones and tearing muscle until all the darkness that makes him feel sad, lonely, and miserable is relieved.</p><p>The woman purses her lips in fury and humiliation. The dethroned princess hasn’t yet accepted that she is now just a shadow to fulfill his whims. She leaves without whispering another word, leaving them alone.</p><p>Qiu Haitang wrings her hands, unable to meet the Demon Lord's gaze even though a year ago she desperately sought him out to tell her story. And he made the mistake of not listening to her.</p><p>“My lord,” she mutters respectfully. “Did you want to see this humble one?”</p><p>Luo Binghe nods with a grunt. He approaches her with predatory steps. His gaze is also hungry: for information, to try to get closer to that shizun that he finds so hard to understand.</p><p>"You disappeared when Shen Jiu rescued his brother and rejected all accusations. Why? Where did you go?"</p><p>The woman bows her head. Like Xiao Gongzhu, she also had her little palace and her haven of riches. But they burned. Unlike Xiao Gongzhu, she has already accepted that her life has irretrievably changed, although Qiu Haitang continues to cling to those threads of her past that have become tangled in painful knots.</p><p>"This humble one was taken aback by Master Shen's words and I decided to investigate whether they were true or not."</p><p>For the first time in many days, Luo Binghe draws a sincere smile.</p><p>"Follow me, miss. This Lord will be delighted to hear you."</p><p>A year later Qiu Haitang hadn't changed at all: she was still desperate for someone to hear her story and feel sorry for her.</p><p>Luo Binghe led her to his office to enjoy a private conversation. Although he orders tea and pastries to be served to make the woman feel comfortable, he also makes sure that his silent talismans are active. No one else should know those secrets.</p><p>"In your opinion, miss," he says, fiddling with his cup. "The man you are looking for and my shizun are or are they not the same person?"</p><p>Qiu Haitang takes a deep breath. Her discomfort is reflected in her tense posture and the force with which she clenches her fists.</p><p>"Physically they look alike as if they were family... or the same person."</p><p>"But many years have passed since the last time you saw each other," he observes.</p><p>"I know! But A-Jiu was my fiancé. He was always with me. I know him very well... I used to know him very well." She corrects herself, spitting out the words bitterly.</p><p>And Luo Binghe listens to her as envy burns inside his chest, black flames suffocating his hungry heart.</p><p>"You think my shizun was your fiancé." Although he tries to control himself, his words are deep roars, typical of a wild animal. "No. My mistake, sorry, miss. You think my shizun is your slave."</p><p>For the first time, she lifts her head and looks into his eyes with the echo of past arrogance.</p><p>"My family released A-Jiu."</p><p>But Luo Binghe prefers to think of slaves rather than fiances, although both words leave a bitter aftertaste in his mouth. His shizun belongs to no one (only him). But there is still a lot that he doesn't understand and that is why he needs to listen to Qiu Haitang, even if he doesn't want to accept her truths as real.</p><p>"Besides, they have the same name," she mutters under her breath. "What I don't understand is why he now has a brother. A-Jiu was alone, we were his only family. We would know if there had been another child identical to him! Of course, we would have freed him too! We were going to be family!"</p><p>Luo Binghe drums his fingers on the table. And he frowns, fully aware of the differences between his two shizuns. It wouldn't surprise him if they had been raised in different environments.</p><p>"You've been researching for a year, what have you found?"</p><p>"Nothing," she acknowledges as she ducks her head. "But it is suspicious. I wanted to investigate the origins of the sect leader Yue to search for Master Shen's family. But I haven’t found anything: not a house, not a city, not names. I’m sure, my Lord: my A-Jiu and Master Shen is the same person." She takes a deep breath. "But I don't know who his brother is, or what family he belongs to or why sect leader Yue is involved... Because he is involved. Perhaps Master Shen is blackmailing him to use him as an alibi."</p><p>"It's an interesting mystery, miss." Luo Binghe acknowledges with a thoughtful expression. "Are you sure my shizun massacred your family?"</p><p>"Of course!"</p><p>"But my shizun loved you, didn't he?" Al Demon Lord is unable to contain the sarcasm from his voice. "And you were very attentive and kind to him, why would my shizun kill your brother?"</p><p>Qiu Haitang closed her eyes, thus hiding her deep sadness.</p><p>"I don't know," she acknowledged in a whisper fainter than an echo.</p><p>"What if it wasn't him?"</p><p>"Are you talking about Wu Yanzi?"</p><p>Luo Binghe had already forgotten that that unknown man also had his role in that tangled story.</p><p>"Do you have solid evidence for the presence of Wu Yanzi or just tales and rumors?" She looks at him indignantly, but her silence is an eloquent response. "This Lord thinks it was my shizun's real family who killed yours, miss."</p><p>Qiu Haitan's eyes widen in surprise.</p><p>"What are you talking about?"</p><p>"I have always known that my two shizuns were very different from each other. I wouldn’t be surprised to find that Shen Yuan was happily raised with his family while Shen Jiu was abandoned. Or perhaps kidnapped to be sold as a slave." Luo Binghe again taps his fingers with rhythmic strokes. "Shizun is graceful as a noble. A powerful family has powerful enemies. That might explain why they grew up apart... and why they eliminated your family to get Shen Jiu back."</p><p>Qiu Haitang bites her lip. And he doesn’t need words to know that she regrets having been a naive child during that time.</p><p>"I was unaware of my brother and father's affairs," she acknowledges with a sigh. "But if they had threatened us, I think I would have noticed."</p><p>"Miss, if you married Shen Jiu he would become part of your family."</p><p>"Why then did they leave me alive?" Tears pool in her eyes. "Why take my loved ones away from me if I was the problem!?"</p><p>"Maybe my shizun interceded for you. Did it ever seem strange to you that only you survived?"</p><p>Although she opens her mouth, she only mutters strangled noises that are mistaken for sobs. Luo Binghe takes his cup of tea and drinks for the first time.</p><p>"Maybe Wu Yanzi is just a rumor," he continues to unravel his theories. "A powerful family can erase their trace. That's why you can't find them. They used Wu Yanzi's excuse to hide the truth."</p><p>Luo Binghe speaks with ice confidence: cold, but that the sun can melt. However, he prefers to appease a possible enemy of his shizun and avoid a disaster like another trial. In addition, his theory would fit into that mystery marked by contradictions. Luo Binghe's expression darkens. The nightmares are one of the most striking differences between the two shizuns: Shen Yuan doesn’t have any and Shen Jiu suffers too many.</p><p>The life of one has always been happy and the other has endured the hardships of slavery.</p><p>Luo Binghe's blood bubbles and burns, seething with rage against that rotten world. Humans hurt his shizun, that's why Shen Jiu warned him when he was little. <em> I’ll promise you, shizun, </em> he thinks as he clenches his fist and the cup explodes into pieces. <em> I will create a better world for us. </em>Even though some porcelain shards have been stuck in his hand, Luo Binghe doesn't react. The pain from the cuts is paltry compared to the injuries from his past.</p><p>He also knew cruelty and harm when he was little. The Demon Lord finds it easy to empathize with his shizun: perhaps their stories are more similar than they seemed. But he had a kind mother, who cared for and protected him, while Shen Jiu was alone until he was adopted by the Qiu.</p><p>Thanks to that gesture, Luo Binghe ignores his jealousy and allows his shizun's former fiancée to leave with a generous reward. And the promise that if she finds more information she will look for him again.</p><p>Luo Binghe planned to conquer the Human Realm with the support and advice of his shizun, but now he has no choice but to use it to force him back. And after talking to Qiu Haitang, now his ideas have been clarified.</p><p>He will eliminate poverty and slavery. He will make the rich and powerful pay for their crimes.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>As humans and demons search for the lost cultivator, Shen Jiu hides behind a bamboo hat and black robes. Four months after his escape they still repeat the same description: green clothes like bamboo, a fan, and the elegant attitude of a scholar.</p><p>The first thing he did upon leaving the sect was to dress up as a rogue cultivator. No one will mistake the <em> virtuous </em>Shen Qingqiu for someone who seems to be playing with demonic cultivation.</p><p>Shen Jiu is tired of waiting, of the fatigue that covers his head with fog and freezes his bones, of feeling insignificant and that is why he has decided to search for Shen Yuan. Armed with Mu Qingfang's list of places where he may be buried, he travels without stopping and ignoring the convulsions of a shaken world.</p><p>Aware of the persecution, Shen Jiu avoids the inns and prefers to stay in the brothels. Someone like Liu Qingge will never dare to enter there and Luo Binghe was too young when he used to visit the Warm Red Pavilion. Also, brothels are the best places to pay attention to rumors.</p><p>"Did you hear? The Demon Lord has also conquered Shang Hu City. His army is now heading to Jinlan City."</p><p>"I'm scared when they get here! They say his army is made up of humans and demons alike."</p><p>"Oh, but he hasn't destroyed any of those cities. The Demon Lord appropriates the treasures but allows the citizens to get on with their lives. He has even meted out justice."</p><p>"Everyone knows that the Demon Lord is looking for his shizun."</p><p>But Shen Jiu doesn’t walk through cities but forests and places rich in spiritual energy. Although Luo Binghe is cornering him, he can still wander safely.</p><p>"Oh! Have you read the new volume of the <em> Resentment of Chunshan </em>?"</p><p>Shen Jiu nearly choked on his liquor. After retrieving Shen Yuan, he will find the infamous Liu Su Mian Hua and tear off her fingers one by one. His cheeks burn as he remembers the hideous obscenities he once read by mistake. Since then, he has always destroyed all the horrible books, no matter how suspicious they are.</p><p>"Of course!"</p><p>"Sometimes I wonder if the story is real or just fiction... They say that both the Demon Lord and the War God are very handsome and powerful."</p><p>"And Master Shen is a beauty matched only by his brother."</p><p>"I don't understand why he is running away from his lovers. They are both desperately in love with him."</p><p>"Well, according to the books, maybe two lovers are too much for poor Master Shen."</p><p>Shen Jiu is tense and wishes to get up to escape from that terrible conversation.</p><p>"Despite the rivalry between the two, why doesn't the War God prevent the Demon Lord from conquering us? What are the great cultivation sects doing!?"</p><p>"I have heard that the Cang Qiong Sect is busy fighting the terrifying monsters that lay siege to the mountain. They have even had to evacuate the nearest villages."</p><p>"Oh what dangerous times we live in!"</p><p>Shen Jiu pays and leaves the brothel while sighing. Although he decided to cut ties with his sect, something inside his chest trembles and suffers upon hearing the rumors. Shen Jiu grits his teeth and walks almost running, although, in reality, he tries to flee from his desire to return.</p><p>But it was the only way to protect them from Luo Binghe's rage. He has already brought them too much trouble. It's better if he disappears. Perhaps his life was never destined for sect greatness. Shen Jiu is aware of being a terrible person and an even worse shizun. Luo Binghe is a problem that he has raised and allowed to grow without ever trying to stop him. Not even now.</p><p>He will already decide what to do when he gets Shen Yuan back. His brother is better Shen Qingqiu than him and can stay at Qing Jing Peak while he looks for a quiet place to rest without being disturbed by anyone else ever again. However, during the nights, Shen Jiu thinks back to Luo Binghe's obsession. He must act before Shen Yuan returns, but he always puts it off for another day.</p><p>And so four months of escaping and without results have disappeared.</p><p>Shen Jiu is heading through an area near the demonic border. Those lonely and wild roads, where there are not even thieves, are a balm for the wounds of his heart. He allows himself to rest and forget the world behind him.</p><p>It is almost sunset when a shout breaks the silence.</p><p>Shen Jiu turns with a heavy heart to discover one of the men who are looking for him with wide eyes and bright with disbelief at finally finding him. And he, without allowing him to say anything, turns and runs as fast as he can.</p>

<span>“SHEN QINGQIU!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It's been a long time since Shen Jiu hears Liu Qingge screaming that name. His frustration is an echo of a past rage and Shen Jiu runs quicker, not looking back and hardly breathing. Instantly, he hears the metallic hiss of a sword being drawn. And although he tries to run faster than the wind, Cheng Luan is a flash that reaches him in a few seconds.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu stumbles when Liu Qingge cuts his way. Without hesitation, he turns his back on him to avoid him. However, before regaining the distance between them, his annoying shidi grabs his wrist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Stop running!" He hisses, pulling him back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Shen Jiu growls as he shakes his arm to free himself. His abrupt movement causes Liu Qingge to lose his balance and trip off the sword. And although he falls, at no time does he let go of him. Shen Jiu protests when Liu Qingge collapses on top of him and the two end up on the ground. The hit against his head and back is dry but less annoying than when Liu Qingge's body crushes his.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Stupid shidi!" He splutters as he tries to push him away. "Leave me alone!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>But his expression darkens with a frown. With precise movements, Liu Qingge catches both of his wrists ignoring his snorts and furious hisses. Shen Jiu ends up trapped against the ground, Liu Qingge's weight pinning him down as he holds his arms against his chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I've been looking for you for months." His voice is hoarse and awakens in Shen Jiu a tremor as he remembers the last time they saw each other. "No one knew anything about you. We were afraid something had happened to you... Why do you keep running away?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>His eyes are red and wet. Shen Jiu gulps and avoids him looking away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I have to search for A-Yuan," he mutters with the confidence of a lie repeated a thousand times.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We can look for him together! Why haven't you told us anything for these months? We didn't even know if you were alive!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge's voice trembles on the verge of fragmenting. Shen Jiu also feels those same cracks ripping through him as his self-control falls apart, breaks, crumbles like a sandcastle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What I do is none of your business, shidi," he answers coldly, trying to sit up, although that brings him even closer to Liu Qingge. "A-Yuan is my responsibility. And so is Luo Binghe. It's better if I keep my distance from the sect to avoid problems for you."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"And you couldn't even have explained it to us?" Liu Qingge holds his wrists even tighter. "You left without saying goodbye or any warning. And you disappeared for months while we were all looking for you. I never believed you were a coward, Shen Jiu."</span>
</p><p>
<span>That accusation makes him stiffen. Shen Jiu grits his teeth as he glares at him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You can't accuse me of anything, shidi. You abandoned me first!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"That is not true!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh, and will you also deny that you don't care about me? I know. I'm not the nice one. I'm nasty, unpleasant, and spiteful." Shen Jiu spits out the words without hiding that acidity that poisons his voice and eyes. "Oh, please, I'm not an idiot. You all hated me before A-Yuan appeared. You too, shidi. I’m the hateful Shen Qingqiu, the scum of Cang Qiong Peak..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shut up." Liu Qingge interrupts him with an expression ranging from dumbfounded to horrified. "What are you talking about?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don't be an idiot now! You didn't come back after finding out that A-Yuan was alive!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Because I was hurt!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu's eyes widen in confusion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What?" He splutters out of breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Your damn disciple hurt me the second time I went after you." Liu Qingge closes his eyes and Shen Jiu tries to ignore that stabbing pain that pierces his head. He doesn't remember a second time. Only the failure of the first and the rescue a year later.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It's a lie. But Liu Qingge never lies. And his expression is determined when he looks into his eyes again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I'm sorry. I couldn't go back. The sect didn't let me either because... you weren't well, Shen Jiu." Liu Qingge takes a deep breath. "You are as important to us as Shen Yuan. Have you forgotten? Your disciples sent you letters every month because they were worried about you. Mu Qingfang negotiated with that beast to be able to visit you and help you. Shang Qinghua has taken care of your peak in your absence. Even that disgusting demon is conquering the world to find you! "</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gently, Liu Qingge releases his wrists. And after hesitating, he hugs him. It's been so long that Shen Jiu trembles at being engulfed by someone else's affection. It is a pleasant warmth that pierces his bones and soothes his heart.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I've missed you," Liu Qingge whispers, his voice wet with tears.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu closes his eyes before holding onto him and crying. All the wounds and scars that Mu Qingfang showed him months ago with his words hurt again. It's a ghostly ache in his chest, inside his head, in his fingers digging into his clothes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I'm sorry..." He splutters. "I couldn't go back because..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because he was afraid of the cold of an empty house, of looking into the eyes of others and seeing Shen Yuan's reflection. To discover that everyone still hated him. That everyone would have preferred him to be the one who was dead. The fear of not knowing how to solve Luo Binghe's problem because one wrong word could arouse hatred in him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu trembles and Liu Qingge hugs him tighter. For a few minutes, neither of them say anything. They just stand still and silent, comforted by the beating of their hearts.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>They find an abandoned house near a swamp. Their silence soon occupies the dusty interior until there is barely room for them. Shen Jiu covers his face with his bamboo hat, embarrassed by his red eyes and disheveled appearance. Liu Qingge looks at him without saying anything, but there is a concern in his gaze that doesn’t need words to reach him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Let's rest here tonight," Shen Jiu orders, desperate to keep control of the situation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Tomorrow..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Tomorrow we will decide what we will do."</span>
</p><p>
<span>He immediately regrets interrupting him with such a brusque and unpleasant voice. Hiding after an aggressive attitude is a bad habit that he cannot get rid of yet. Shen Jiu bites his lip before sighing and ducking his head in apology.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Sorry. It's just that... I need time."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It's okay, I will wait." Liu Qingge examines the room with his arms folded, though he quickly looks back at him. "But whatever you decide, I will go with you. You are no longer alone, Shen Jiu, please don't forget it."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Until Shen Yuan's arrival, he was always alone. Liu Qingge's promise is as warm as terrifying. It makes him happy, but also insecure. Shen Jiu has forgotten what it's like to behave around other people. With Shen Yuan was complicated, but he no longer remembers how it happened. Suddenly, Mu Qingfang's words echo in his head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Trust.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu takes a deep breath. Trusting Liu Qingge doesn't seem complicated. Maybe because deep down he already wants to do it. He is terrified of trusting the wrong person, but Liu Qingge inspires security.</span>
</p><p>
<span>What did Mu Qingfang say to him? Small steps. Tiny changes. Shen Jiu can start by trusting Shen Yuan and Liu Qingge before trying with the others.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Rest, shidi. I'll take the first watch."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I can meditate."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu shakes his head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I need time to think."</span>
</p><p>
<span>He needs silence and solitude to face his thoughts and make a decision. Liu Qingge understands as he nods without insisting. That night, Liu Qingge rests in a corner with his eyes closed and legs crossed, while Shen Jiu sits at the entrance to the wooden house. His gaze is lost in the sky, reddish by the presence of the Demon Realm. Its stars are more golden, the clouds are blacker. But the cold that stalks him is born from his bones.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they broke their embrace, Liu Qingge asked him what he wanted to do.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But there is a gulf between what he should do and what he wants. Shen Jiu digs his nails into his sleeves, restless. He knows that Liu Qingge will accompany him to search for Shen Yuan perhaps until the end of the world. But that won’t solve the problem of Luo Binghe nor the situation of the sect. Shen Jiu has been aware of their covert warfare, but he kept running out of cowardice. It is his responsibility and he should return, but then Luo Binghe will prevent him from continuing to search for Shen Yuan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And the truth is that... he is afraid to face Luo Binghe. Shen Jiu always tells himself that he must do something with his obsession, with his sword, with his hunger for power, but he never thinks of solutions. He just runs, runs, runs, aware that he has fueled Luo Binghe's darkness by hiding the truth about Shen Yuan from him. This tense and fragile situation is his fault and no one else's.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu has tried to ignore it, but the monster he has created has grown immense.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>When Liu Qingge wakes up, a hazy light comes through the windows and there is weight over him. Confused, he opens his eyes to find Shen Jiu snuggled against him, his face buried in the crook of his neck and almost sitting on his lap. His legs tingle after so many hours in that position, in addition to the extra weight on them. But Liu Qingge ignores his discomfort, only aware of the heat that burns inside his chest until it reaches his face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Unconsciously, he tries to get up even though that means pushing Shen Jiu to the ground.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"WHAT ARE YOU DOING?" He splutters while the other grumbles rubbing his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Sleep, shidi. Or trying to sleep," Shen Jiu growls. "Do you know how many nights I've been without sleep, you inconsiderate brute? Why can't you just let me rest?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu sits up amid furious yawns. Liu Qingge looks at him dumbfounded by his impudence and still with that pleasant warmth hugging his body.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He decides to wait before asking him about his decision.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A shichen later, back on the abandoned roads, Shen Jiu finally speaks to him again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We return to Cang Qiong Mountain Sect, but I don't want to attract anyone's attention." </span>
<em>
<span>Anyone </span>
</em>
<span>means Luo Binghe. "We will go slow and avoid cities. Will shidi be discreet for the first time in his life?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge smiles helplessly. He had missed Shen Jiu's malice. His cheeky attitude is better than sadness. Hopefully, he will soon regain his past strength. Liu Qingge still has nightmares about the frail and tired Shen Jiu that he encountered in the palace.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I'm not the one they're looking for," he points out. "Will my shixiong not attract any demons?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu's eyes widen in surprise as his ears turn pink. He mutters an offended groan at that word before regaining his composure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I have proven to be discreet. Everyone knew where the War God was, but no one knew where this master was." He takes off his bamboo hat and approaches Liu Qingge with a mischievous glint in his eyes. "You should dress up, shidi."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu delicately places the hat on him. His fingers brush strands of hair away from his face, and Liu Qingge’s heart almost stops as they brush his cheeks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Much better," he announces, pulling away with satisfaction. "We must hide your beauty, shidi, or everyone will notice you."</span>
</p><p>
<span>As in the past, Shen Jiu always has the last word.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge is grateful that that stupid bamboo hat hides his embarrassed expression.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Used to his bad luck, Shen Jiu should have imagined that everything was going to end wrong. But he has been fooled by Liu Qingge's presence during those days of travel. His heart sank whenever he disappeared to hunt and then breathed in relief when Liu Qingge returned with a defeated monster. The nights became more pleasant as he took refuge in him and slept with the same serenity as the day he rescued him. (Although shame prevents Shen Jiu from recognizing Liu Qingge as an effective remedy for his insomnia.)</span>
</p><p>
<span>But those days of peace end as abruptly as the wall of ice that cuts their way. They both turn: Liu Qingge with his hand on Cheng Luan's hilt and him with a racing pulse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I finally found you, shizun."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe stands next to Mobei-jun. His smile is more satisfied than happy and Shen Jiu shivers while raising an arm to stop Liu Qingge before he is reckless.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Luo Binghe," he acknowledges, tilting his head. "It's been a long time."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shizun, come back with me."</span>
</p><p>
<span>The Demon Lord extends a hand towards him in an almost pleading gesture. Shen Jiu closes his eyes. He can no longer run away. It is the moment of truth, to face his fears, of everything he abandoned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No. This Master has to do something. I..." He takes a deep breath before lifting his head and looking into his eyes. "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have left while you stupidly fought. This Master made a mistake and I was too cowardly to fix it."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shizun is not a coward."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don't contradict me, Luo Binghe." Shen Jiu sighs. "It is fortunate that we met today. I return to the sect. I’m still Qing Jing Peak Master and have delayed my duties for too long. And then, this Master will leave again to complete his mission."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe squints his eyes suspiciously.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What mission, shizun?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>His mistrust crushes his lungs, fills his mouth with the taste of dust. Shen Jiu doesn't say anything. He cannot trust Luo Binghe. It’s too scary, risky, and dangerous.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu can perfectly see how something breaks in the Demon Lord's gaze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mobei-Jun.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ice chaos shakes the road. Fang-like icebergs grow between them. Shen Jiu hisses furiously as he tries to keep his balance. He doesn't have time to worry about Liu Qingge, as Luo Binghe appears before him in a dark blur. Shen Jiu curses having relegated Liu Qingge for the past few days as he kept Xiu Ya as a precaution in his storage. But since Luo Binghe also does not draw Xin Mo, he uses martial arts to avoid him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Luo Binghe, stop!" He screams angrily.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But his wayward disciple ignores him once more. Luo Binghe catches his wrist and drags him towards him. Shen Jiu hits him with an open palm, managing to free himself. That only infuriates him even more. The Demon Lord's expression darkens. A wave of demonic qi hits Shen Jiu against the ice wall. The shock almost takes his breath away. With one arm he holds him against the ice, demonic qi devouring his every time he tries to defend himself. Shen Jiu watches as Luo Binghe puts a hand to his mouth and bites to blood.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fear is as cold as the ice in which he is trapped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don't you dare, Luo Binghe!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>But the Demon Lord immobilizes him with his weight and forces his jaw to open. Shen Jiu hisses as those fingers are forced in and demon blood slides down his throat. He digs his nails into Luo Binghe's arm and his wrist trying to scratch him, but he doesn't turn away from him or stop.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I'm sorry, shizun. But you haven't left me any other alternative."</span>
</p><p>
<span>And his body collapses into Luo Binghe's arms. There is a panic scream stuck in his throat as he realizes that he is trapped in his own body. His limbs fall limp, he can't even move his head. Luo Binghe carries him like a doll, holding him carefully so as not to hurt him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Mobei-Jun," he calls out to his servant.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And the two disappear into the shadows while Shen Jiu hears Liu Qingge's yelling anguished his name.</span>

<p>Trapped in his prison of flesh and blood, Shen Jiu only recognizes shadows and flashes rather than seeing the entire landscape. The shapes around them are familiar, but the air smells different and the sky is reddish. It is not the palace that he knows, but perhaps another one in the Demon Realm.</p><p>Fury runs through Shen Jiu's body when he tries to look at Luo Binghe.</p><p>"Release me," he hisses with difficulty. Even his jaw and tongue are numb from those chains tangled in his blood.</p><p>To his surprise, Luo Binghe breaks his control, restoring the mobility of his own body. Still, Shen Jiu is furious when he pulls away from him and his feet touch the ground. Knowing that his parasites roam freely inside him makes him feel dirty, that something very important has been stolen from him.</p><p>He doesn't hesitate when he slaps Luo Binghe.</p><p>"Take them away."</p><p>Luo Binghe brings a hand slowly to his face. There is a scratch on his left cheek and his fingers caress the wound in disbelief. However, he sighs before looking at him and ignoring the anger that floods his eyes.</p><p>"I'm glad shizun is better."</p><p>"I'm not better, I'm furious," he growls. "Luo Binghe, take away your damn parasites."</p><p>"No."</p><p>His answer doesn't surprise him, but it coldly disappoints him while a false calm settles in his body.</p><p>"Neither A-Yuan nor I educate you to behave like a beast, Luo Binghe," he mutters the words one by one to spit them out angrily.</p><p>Shen Jiu doesn't mind that his expression darkens. Because Luo Binghe's anger will only be a tenth of his.</p><p>"Shizun had disappeared. This disciple was very worried about Shizun," he replies in a cutting voice. "Despite all my efforts, shizun never came back. Now I will always know where shizun is."</p><p>"Where I am and what I do is none of your business, Luo Binghe!!"</p><p>"I was worried that someone would have hurt you! But no. You were with Liu-shishu," he adds spitefully as if that is the worst of all his crimes.</p><p>"This Master can be with whoever he wants and no disciple can prevent him."</p><p>They both look at each other in silence, aware that their bond between master-disciple is knotted and twisted.</p><p>After a pause, Luo Binghe sighs.</p><p>"I will show shizun his new rooms."</p><p>"No, Luo Binghe. I'm leaving."</p><p>"No. The Demon Realm is dangerous and these days the rebels have become bolder. I will allow shizun to come out when the situation is safest... and I can trust you."</p><p>His words infuriate him even more.</p><p>"I'm not your pet! You can't decide what to do or where I want to be or who will be with me."</p><p>Luo Binghe has the nerve to smile.</p><p>"Right. You are not a pet, but my shizun."</p><p>In the end, the two walk in tense silence, sharp as a thousand thorns. Disarmed from his power of choice and freedom, Shen Jiu ignores him disdainfully. He barely reacts when Luo Binghe guides him to a small palace surrounded by bamboo. Although that ambitious part of him appreciates luxury and beauty, his anger only sees a beautiful cage, a horrible and cruel prison.</p><p>The palace is clean and reminiscent of his bamboo house. Shen Jiu, hiding his thoughts behind a cold grimace, recognizes the belongings that he had forgotten in the other palace. Although he has never been to that place, Luo Binghe has built it in such a way that he unconsciously feels it as a possible home.</p><p>Shen Yuan's body rests limp and covered in frost in an icy room.</p><p>His heart trembles at the thought of the brother he has lost and that he will soon return. He has missed him more than anyone. Unable to continue staring at his corpse, Shen Jiu turns and continues to examine the palace. Luo Binghe follows him like a puppy waiting for his approval. But the cheerful little dog has bitten him where it hurts the most and Shen Jiu will not forgive him even in exchange for all the riches in the world.</p><p>He thinks of Shen Yuan again. And in Liu Qingge’s words. And in all the memories that his illness blurred. A year ago, he lived in a room that was never for Shen Yuan since he had his own. Now, they both have their palace.</p><p>Shen Jiu has been so blind that only now he understands the magnitude of Luo Binghe's obsession with the two of them.</p><p>Unable to continue ignoring the trouble he has created, Shen Jiu turns to Luo Binghe with his arms crossed.</p><p>"This Master is going to enjoy a hot bath. I want to see you at noon."</p><p>"This disciple will prepare the food."</p><p>"Do what you want. We will eat together and talk." His gaze obliterates the Demon Lord's smile. "Because this Master is very disappointed in you, Luo Binghe."</p><p>The palace has its servants, but Shen Jiu dismisses them with a gesture. Because he is not a pretty possession and even if he is locked up, at least he will try to impose his rules. And he still remembers how easy it was to let them treat him like a doll when he didn't have the energy to rebuild his life.</p><p>After so many months wandering the world like a faceless shadow, Shen Jiu allows himself to rest in an aromatic bath. Although the hot water relaxes his muscles and eliminates the smell of mud and plants that had clung to his skin, there are thoughts inside his head buzzing like flies.</p><p>Worry accompanies him when he dresses in elegant robes, green like bamboo, but all decorated with red or black threads. Luo Binghe’s symbols. Perhaps later he will tear them off or demand that his former disciple give him other clothes that don’t make him feel like property. Among the objects that he finds in the room, the thing that most excites him is the fans. He had missed having one, but it was the first thing he removed from his appearance to avoid being recognized.</p><p>Shen Jiu is hiding behind a fan when Luo Binghe returns.</p><p>The Demon Lord has prepared an excessive banquet for two people. And even though the appetizing smell and bright colors of the food make him hungry, Shen Jiu stands his ground to not lose his motivation between bites. He pours little food on his plate and then looks at his disciple. Luo Binghe doesn't hide his nervousness, nor the useless and feeble hope that this charade would work.</p><p>"Where do I begin?" Shen Jiu takes the chopsticks. "First, Cang Qiong Mountain Sect. This Master is aware of all the rumors about the strange beasts that stalk his sect. Your sect, Luo Binghe." He doesn't ask if it's his fault because they both know it. Annoyed, he looks at his face, searching in his features shame and regret. "Fix-it. Apologize to Yue Qingyuan. And pay compensation for all the damage your childish attitude has caused them."</p><p>Shen Jiu watches Luo Binghe swallow hard. But he prevents him from speaking with more cutting words.</p><p>"Second, the Demon Realm. This Master acknowledges his ignorance of demon society. But since I stayed in your other palace, you have always been busy fighting them. And now, several months later, you are warning me about rebels and dangers." He pauses and Luo Binghe trembles, preparing for the next blow. "Why are you wasting your time in a stupid war? Enlighten this Master, Luo Binghe."</p><p>"If I rule demons, the fights between humans and demons will end. No more skinners, no more sowers."</p><p>"It seems that you know even less than this Master about demons. Or the world. Reality is complex, Luo Binghe. Imposing your tyranny will never be the solution." But Shen Yuan told him about the heavenly demons. Shen Jiu sighs. "Is that really your motivation, Luo Binghe? Or is it your desire for fame and recognition? It was you who desired this palace or those stupid demons who started to venerate you as a god for your blood?"</p><p>"I..." Luo Binghe takes a deep breath before looking into his eyes with determination. "Humans will always reject me for my demon heritage."</p><p>"But you are still at war. Is it because the demons also reject you because of your human blood? Or because you have wanted to impose your existence?"</p><p>"The Demon Realm is more dangerous than human’s, shizun. Our society is built on strength and control."</p><p>"But you could have built a small house in a quiet place and defended your territory instead of striving to be emperor, Luo Binghe."</p><p>"That way I will never change the world, shizun." Luo Binghe looks sincere and tired when he raises his head. "I want a world that accepts me despite my nature."</p><p>Shen Jiu sighs even though he can understand that desire to fix an unfair and imperfect world. And deep down, secretly, he admires Luo Binghe's determination. Despite his origins, he only fought to reach the top without changing anything. He didn’t try despite getting the power to do it. Because he lost hope before he even learned to walk.</p><p>"You're wrong, Binghe," he mutters. "The most important thing to change the world is not power, but will." Shen Jiu shakes his head, embarrassed at speaking nonsense. "What this Master means is that there is no use in dominating demons as long as there is still a wedge between the two races."</p><p>"I know."</p><p>"And here comes the third point: the Human Realm." Shen Jiu pauses to eat. "You haven't even finished the war against one race and have already divided your forces to face the other? Did you fall asleep in our classes?" Shen Jiu eats more to calm his moodiness. "Now what? Will you enforce the presence of demons in the cities you have conquered? They see you as a demon. A demon that brings more demons and has annihilated one of the major cultivation sects. Why do you think that the best way to achieve peace between the two races was with war? "</p><p>When they hear noises and screams, Shen Jiu is not startled but accepts the chaos with relief. His stupid disciple has created a lot of complex dilemmas without simple solutions.</p><p>"Stay here, shizun."</p><p>Luo Binghe gets up and goes to the door. Obviously, Shen Jiu follows him, curious and eager for more information on the situation of the Demon Realm. Although Luo Binghe tenses upon noticing his presence, he says nothing and allows him to walk beside him.</p><p>However, there are no rebels or monsters in front of the palace gates, but rather a furious cultivator dressed in white. Liu Qingge is facing several soldiers when he recognizes them and points Cheng Luan at Luo Binghe.</p><p>"Release him. Now." He hisses, disheveled and with a cut across his cheek.</p><p>Shen Jiu strikes Luo Binghe's hand with his fan before he unsheathes Xin Mo.</p><p>"Fourth point, your sword. We will talk about it later." Then Shen Jiu smiles before looking at Liu Qingge. "You have been unexpectedly fast, shidi. I thought it would take you another day to arrive. Come."</p><p>"Shizun!" Luo Binghe stiffens and his eyes shine perhaps with jealousy.</p><p>But Shen Jiu faces him and rests the tip of his fan against his chest.</p><p>"Luo Binghe, you have already offended your Master by taking away his freedom to go wherever he wants, as well as binding him with your blood. It’s fine. I will stay. But in exchange, you will not prevent people I appreciate from visiting me, understand? "</p><p>As he scolds the demon, Liu Qingge approaches with cautious steps. He has not sheathed his sword. He and Luo Binghe silently challenge each other with looks of intense hatred. Shen Jiu ignores them, turning his back.</p><p>"Bring another plate for shidi. Now, this Master is hungry and would appreciate a quiet meal without fighting or arguing, is it clear?"</p><p>And this is how Shen Jiu ends up in his little palace with an annoying Demon Lord and an even more angry cultivator, both caught in a tense and fragile truce. As they continue their past fight with hisses and growls, glances of hatred capable of piercing through walls, he savors the meal.</p><p>It's been a long time since he was able to enjoy such delicious food.</p><p>"Luo Binghe," he says and his former disciple raises his head with the same enthusiasm of a puppy. "Is it true that you hurt your shishu?"</p><p>His smile disappears and he pales. Instead of answering, Luo Binghe nods.</p><p>"Apologize. Right now."</p><p>The tension between them is even worse when Luo Binghe sits up, proud and with no hint of regret in his arrogant expression.</p><p>"This disciple apologizes for beating his shishu in a fair fight."</p><p>It's a miracle that Liu Qingge doesn’t get up and punch him in the face. Just in case, Shen Qingqiu clears his throat.</p><p>"I don't want any more violent acts between the two of you. Nor with Cang Qiong Peak," he adds, staring at Luo Binghe, who lowers his head.</p><p>Luo Binghe has perfected the art of acting adorable and innocent, but Shen Jiu is still furious at his trick with blood.<em> If you want this Master to stay with you so badly, I hope you are ready to make some changes in your life. </em>For example, his aspiration for Shen Yuan. Shen Jiu will only tolerate a suitor who meets all of his exacting requirements and Luo Binghe is currently an untamed beast.</p><p>"I hope that shizun is enjoying the food that this disciple has prepared."</p><p>"I never thought that a Qing Jing Peak disciple would be stupid enough to believe that with food he will be able to forgive that you have kidnapped him."</p><p>Apparently, Shen Jiu has an unexpected fifth problem: they, for some inexplicable reason, are interested in him too.</p><p>"This Master wants to eat in peace," he growls. "Instead of arguing, can you converse like two civilized people?"</p><p>Liu Qingge clenches his fists on the table as Luo Binghe flashes a smug smile.</p><p>"Do you like literature, shishu?"</p><p>It's an innocent question, but Liu Qingge stiffens like he's been threatened with a sword.</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Too bad. This disciple was hoping he could have an intelligent conversation with his shishu about books. There is a recent collection that you may have heard of, Resentment of Chunshan?"</p><p>Shen Jiu covers himself with a sleeve discreetly to feign utter ignorance about that heinous literature.</p><p>"I'm aware," Liu Qingge's reply is curt. "I understand the second book is better and the rest is crap."</p><p>"Oh, this disciple prefers the first book."</p><p>WHY ARE THEY DISCUSSING THAT HORRENDOUS THING IN FRONT OF HIM? Shen Jiu puts down the chopsticks and stares at them livid before smiling.</p><p>"I don’t know those books, but recently I heard that people prefer the fifth volume, could anyone explain me why?"</p><p>They both stiffen.</p><p>The two answer at the same time: "What fifth volume?"</p><p>They both lie.</p><p>And the two fall silent, allowing him to finally eat in peace.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>"Shidi, go back to Cang Qiong Sect and explain my situation to them." Shen Jiu tells Liu Qingge while Luo Binghe watches over them. "Also tell them that you can all visit me whenever you want. Right, Luo Binghe?"</p><p>"Yes, shizun."</p><p>The Demon Lord is neither happy nor satisfied, but Liu Qingge's departure seems to have softened his mood.</p><p>"I'll be back soon," Liu Qingge announces. "I will not leave you alone with that beast." The beast in question looks at him with hatred. "And I'll bring you real food."</p><p>"Oh!" Shen Jiu covers his lips with his fan. "Will I finally discover your secret disciple?"</p><p>"Secret disciple?"</p><p>"Yes, the one you made cook for us."</p><p>Then, Liu Qingge smiles and gently grasps his wrist with one hand to push the fan away from his face.</p><p>"There was never a disciple. It was me, didn't you know?"</p><p>Shen Jiu tries to hide the embarrassing blush that covers his cheeks, but Liu Qingge stops him without releasing his wrist.</p>

<p>
<span>When he decided to fix the mess that surrounded Luo Binghe, Shen Jiu never imagined that this would be a disaster of colossal magnitudes. The situation is even worse than when he was "invited" to Luo Binghe's palace. Caught between so many wars that robbed his time and effort, Luo Binghe's armies advance slowly as they collect losses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At least Shen Jiu has managed to stop the stupid attacks between his worst disciple and his sect. Of course, the tension still covers both of them and conditions their relationships. And as long as he remains a "guest" in the Demonic Realm, Cang Qiong Sect will continue to watch over Luo Binghe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It is not his sect what worries Shen Jiu, nor the human cities since Luo Binghe accepted without question to stop his conquest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The problem is the demons.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Perhaps Shen Jiu’s knowledge about their hierarchies and societies is scarce, but he is aware of their innate violence, their desire to conquer humans, and their contempt for a half-breed. Although Luo Binghe tries to trick him with gifts and meals to keep him calm, Shen Jiu hears the rumors and the servants’ whispers. And that's why he knows there are problems in the south.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan told him that Luo Binghe is invincible and perfect, but there is another demon facing him that he cannot defeat. It is a disturbing possibility. What he feels is not really fear, but a cold and dirty uncertainty like ashes under his skin. Because despite Shen Yuan's knowledge, there is a lot that they still don't know. Dangerous threats that hide in the dark. And other things are changing from their original purpose.</span>
</p><p>
<span>One night, Shen Jiu is reading when he feels intense dark and bloody energy, then the chaos of servants as they carry out their lord's orders. He frowns and stands up to leave his palace and search for the source of the scandal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu finds Luo Binghe in his private quarters, scruffy and dirty, his back twisted under the weight of wounds oozing demonic qi. Shen Jiu clicks his tongue and that alerts him. Luo Binghe turns tense like a trapped animal and his eyes widen in recognition.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Did you think I wasn’t going to discover you?" His disappointment almost hid his anger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although several days have passed, Shen Jiu still remembers the taste of his blood in his throat and that helplessness of losing control of his own body. But he knows the limitations of his fury. Right now he has very few weapons left to steer Luo Binghe onto the right path. Yelling, insulting, or angering him is counterproductive, but seeing him hurt by one of those stupid wars upsets him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu approaches and Luo Binghe instinctively back away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Humans or demons?" He asks. "I hope you didn't fight your Liu-shishu again."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu worries that his silence hides guilt and shame for breaking his empty promises. But those horrendous injuries could only have been the demons’ fault. Shen Jiu disdains the restless attitude of his disciple and grabs his wrist to examine his meridians. A frown of concern is marked on his forehead as he discovers that his demonic nature is running rampant and almost parasitizing the human.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What are you doing?" Luo Binghe babbles as the blood runs down his lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Disgusted, Shen Jiu takes off a handkerchief and rubs his face vigorously until he protests with grunts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What have I done to deserve such an idiotic disciple?" He scolds him, holding his wrist with one hand while still wiping the blood with the other. "Your stupid wars aren't working, do you understand now or only when they kill you?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Furious, Luo Binghe manages to catch his left wrist and pushes the handkerchief away from his face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I will never die," he promises with a fury that glows in his red eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don't be naive, Luo Binghe: we will all die one day." Shen Jiu releases him and throws the bloody handkerchief at him. "Your qi is a mess, what have you done since the last time I cleaned your meridians? And who have you faced!? This Master is tired, Luo Binghe. You never tell me anything! And your problems concern us both."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu ignores Luo Binghe's darkness, that mess of raging emotions that sharpen his blood-stained features, and seeks out the servants to prepare a bath. His disciple seems to keep standing just because of his pride and stubbornness. Shen Jiu won't leave even though his look is defiant like a wild animal. It’s terrifying, it's uncomfortable, he reminds him of the Luo Binghe for whom Shen Yuan sacrificed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Between beastly grunts and his angry attitude, Luo Binghe manages to expel all the servants once the bathroom is ready. But Shen Jiu stays even though his actions are especially hostile towards him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"A few days before you were boasting that you could beat your Liu-shishu with your eyes closed and today you act like a crybaby who doesn't know how to take a loss," Shen Jiu scoffs with acid words, enjoying that little revenge that doesn't make up for blood parasites within his veins. "I was thinking of calling a healer, but you know what? You don't deserve it. Maybe next time you'll be more sensible when you remember the pain."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe trembles with fury and weakness as he glares at him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Leave, Shen Qingqiu."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No." He leans his back against the wall and crosses his arms. "Now stop being stupidly proud."</span>
</p><p>
<span>His resentment softens a bit as he contemplates Luo Binghe's pathetic attempts to rip off his tattered clothes. Shreds of black cloth fall to the ground. His robes are so dirty and torn that he doesn't even recognize them. And after seeing his wounds, deep and blackened at the edges, his heart shrinks a little, making him regret his cruel attitude.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu leaves when Luo Binghe is taking off his pants.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I will bring you clean robes."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu hesitates upon returning to the bathroom but eventually enters. He is concerned about the scandalous adventures of aberrant books that seem to occupy the mind of his disciple, but that night Luo Binghe is too angry to be kind. There is no adoration in his eyes, but the bewilderment of a spoiled child who has been humiliated.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His disciple watches over him while he leaves the clean clothes near him. Ignoring his discomfort, the tension that is more evident now that he's naked, Shen Jiu looks at his injuries. There are several and that worries him. Whoever has faced Luo Binghe has enough talent to hurt him multiple times.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Who have you fought against?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>His disciple purses his lips, stubborn.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Who have you fought against, Luo Binghe?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don't pretend you care, Shen Qingqiu," he growls like a battered dog that will never trust his owner again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu can understand him. Embarrassed, he clenches his fists without acknowledging his mistake.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I care. Because if they are the same who sent the sowers against my brother, I’ll kill them myself." Shen Jiu shakes his head with his eyes closed. "Your talent is annoying but indisputable, who has hurt you? Was it a demon or several? Have you been ambushed?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Luo Binghe clings to his silence, turning his back to slowly lather up the dried blood and dirt. And Shen Jiu notices how his patience is evaporating.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I don't know why you want me to be here if you never listen to me," he hisses before stomping away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But once outside, Shen Jiu bites his lip and gets mad at himself for making stupid mistakes. Despite his terrifying presence, Luo Binghe still behaves like a puppy begging for affection. At that moment, surely he expected words of comfort and perhaps affection. But Shen Jiu is not kind and doesn’t know how to reciprocate the feelings of others. He is spiteful and direct, painfully rational.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Perhaps if Luo Binghe hadn't kidnapped him and locked him in with his blood, he would have tried to be less cold and kinder today.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Perhaps if he hadn't been broken as a child, he could now be like Shen Yuan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Being a better person is hard.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Next time, perhaps he suggests to Liu Qingge to stay for the night.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Despite the softness of the sheets and the candles that perfume the air, despite the calm and warm night, Shen Jiu has trouble sleeping. Again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That is why he recognizes when someone enters his palace.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu covers himself with a robe before leaving the room. The intruder stands on the threshold of Shen Yuan's room, not daring to go inside. At night and without his Demon Lord clothes, Luo Binghe looks more human. Shen Jiu gulps as he remembers the naive boy who bet that he would never break his sword.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Luo Binghe," his voice is clear and firm. He doesn’t need to speak out because he knows that his disciple will listen to him. "This Master..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>But his throat tightens, drowning out his words. Luo Binghe didn’t apologize for what he did. Why should he be nice if Luo Binghe doesn't deserve it?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe has turned to look at him sideways. In the dark, his eyes burn like embers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This Master is disappointed with the attitude of his disciple and that is why I acted disproportionately today," he manages to mutter. "I don't care if you understand it or not. It's frustrating to be locked in without being able to do anything or move freely. I'm not A-Yuan, Binghe." He takes a deep breath. "A-Yuan was the nice one. I have problems and even though I'm trying to fix them, I'll never change who I am."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Suddenly the night has become colder and more uncomfortable. Shen Jiu wraps his clothes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Before I've been a bit harsh, but even if I want to help you, you always keep me out of your business. You only listen to what you want to hear and maybe this defeat makes you understand that you are human and vulnerable like the others. I care about you, Binghe. But I'm also angry for what you did and you still haven't apologized, so neither will I. "</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu leaves and returns to his room. Soon, he hears how Luo Binghe closes the door to the icy room and leaves the palace. After recognizing some of those thoughts embedded in his stomach, at the end of that night, Shen Jiu finally manages to sleep.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>The next morning, servants tell him that Luo Binghe is locked in his office and doesn’t want to see anyone. Shen Jiu frowns. </span>
<em>
<span>You are no longer a child! How long will your tantrum last?</span>
</em>
<span> Restless, he heads to Luo Binghe's office, located near his rooms. It is off-limits to most except for his trusted generals. But Shen Jiu doesn't care. Since he is forbidden from leaving the palace, he has assumed that he will be able to enter any place inside.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When he opens the door, he discovers Luo Binghe reading at an incredibly messy table. But it is not the chaos that makes him pale, but the novel in his hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu forgets all of his worries as anger and humiliation cover his cheeks with an intense blush. His shameless disciple is perfectly fine! He is locked up so that no one will discover their lord wasting his time with erotic novels!</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh, shizun!" He comments cheekily as he lifts his head. "What brings you to this Lord's chambers?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu disdains disorder and the chaos of scrambled maps and scrolls makes his guts churn. Still, he doesn't hesitate to invoke his qi when he dashes for Luo Binghe and snatches the book from him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu also hates to mistreat books, but that infamous work deserves no other fate than to explode into shreds of paper.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What are you doing reading that?" He roars. "If you are well enough to distract yourself with these activities, could you prepare the gifts you owe Cang Qiong Sect! Or fixing your mess in the Human Realm!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe frowns, annoyed, but he immediately smirks again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It's just fiction, why is shizun so upset?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>He is trembling, his fists clenched and caught under Luo Binghe's curious gaze. All the answers that come to him are scary and dangerous. His intention is for Luo Binghe (and Liu Qingge) to forget the contents of those books, not to feed the possibility.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Someday, Shen Jiu will gut the author.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe squints his eyes. He tilts his head, examining Shen Jiu's figure. Today he wears green with frayed sleeves after pulling out all the black threads.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shizun?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Mn?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shizun~"</span>
</p><p>
<span>If the book wasn’t shredded, he would have used it to hit that stupid empty head. Shen Jiu crosses his arms as he values whether or not to use his fan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What do you want?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Nothing."</span>
</p><p>
<span>His salvation comes when someone knocks on the door. Luo Binghe's smile twists into an annoying grin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I said no one should bother me." He growls at the figure kneeling on the other side.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Forgive this humble one, Jushang. But the War God is here."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh!" A dark, malevolent spark of interest lights up Luo Binghe's gaze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu watches him tense as he stands beside him to leave the office.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I hope you're not planning anything," Shen Jiu warns him, grabbing the fabric of his sleeves. "Your Liu-shishu is your guest."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe nods, but his gesture is false and hypocritical.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu decides to keep an eye on him when they walk to meet Liu Qingge. The animosity between the two is dangerous. No one wanted to tell him what happened that time Luo Binghe "hurt" Liu Qingge. Shen Jiu knows the pride of his shidi, his tenacity, and his strength. Hurting him is complicated, but only a very serious injury would keep him immobile for so long.</span>
</p><p>
<span>However, Luo Binghe acts polite when he sees Liu Qingge, who stiffens when he recognizes him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shishu."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shizi," he growls reluctantly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe leans a little closer, hands behind his back, and a predatory attitude.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Would shishu want to fight this Lord?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu rolls his eyes before grabbing his fan and slapping him on the head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This is how you solve your problems? Since you were defeated yesterday, today you want to take revenge on another person?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe reacts to the hit with an annoyed snort. Although what seems to offend him the most is being reminded of his humiliation in front of his enemy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Fighting shishu will make me stronger. He is the War God of the renowned Cang Qiong Sect, right? Not the Cowardly God." The demon adds maliciously.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Liu Qingge stiffens angrily, falling into his trap.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu sighs as his patience begins to waver.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Not today. You are injured and must rest." He speaks as he places a hand on Liu Qingge's shoulder, who seems eager to face his rival and doesn't care if he's hurt or not. "This Master will examine you later. Now, let's eat."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu has a generous stomach and two eager cooks around him. He doesn’t plan to miss any opportunity.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What happened?" Liu Qingge asks him when they are heading to his little palace. "Is there anyone capable of defeating that little beast? Should I congratulate them or be concerned?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu hits him with the fan on his head as well.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Luo Binghe hasn't told me the details," he huffs. "Let's talk about more important things. Did you bring food, shidi?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No." His refusal disappoints him so much that Shen Jiu pouts unconsciously. "I've hunted a beast on the way. I'll cook it."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You are lucky this Lord is in a good mood today," Luo Binghe grumbles. He walks a few steps behind them and watches over Liu Qingge with the same interest as future prey. With a graceful movement, he stands on Shen Jiu's free side and grabs his arm. "Surprise us, shishu."</span>
</p><p><span>Shen Jiu uses his fan to push Luo Binghe away.</span><em><span> How strange. </span></em><span>He thinks. </span><em><span>Today he hasn’t tried to stand between the two of us.</span></em> <em><span>And he's being decent to Liu Qingge too</span></em><span>... His heart almost stops at the sudden possibility that Luo Binghe is interested in Liu Qingge. What if he was reading the fifth volume of Resentment of Chunshan before? What if he has discovered how beautiful and talented Liu Qingge is?</span></p><p>
<span>After all, Shen Jiu is unfriendly and unpleasant, the cruel copy of Shen Yuan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Logically, two such attractive men will forget him when they discover the virtues of the other.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That premonition haunts him a half shichen later when they are gathered at the low table. Luo Binghe praises Liu Qingge's food and gives him some advice that he accepts suspiciously. Shen Jiu doesn't understand what is happening. What if he was poisoned last night and he, blinded by his bad temper, didn't realize it?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu eats in increasingly thoughtful and leaden silence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>What if it is true that Luo Binghe has taken an interest in Liu Qingge? Why does that bother him so much? From the beginning, he knew that both of them had fallen in love first with Shen Yuan. And he never intended to start a romantic relationship with anyone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But jealousy stabs his stomach and makes his food sour, even though he will never acknowledge that he wants to be loved.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Love is a ridiculous feeling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And those who fall in love quickly and forget even faster are the worst criminals.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu angrily chews the meat, ignoring its sweet taste from the fruit sauce. His companions no longer try to talk to each other or eat but instead stare at him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Is something wrong, Shen Jiu?" Liu Qingge asks cautiously. "You seem mad."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Of course I'm not mad!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I know Liu-shishu's food is undercooked, but you shouldn't piss off, shizun..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I told you I'm not mad! Why isn't anyone listening to me?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, the door opens with a slam that almost smashes it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They all turn at the same time. Shen Qingqiu drops his chopsticks and his eyes widen at the sight of a second Luo Binghe disheveled and furious, his eyes gleaming with bloodlust.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Get away from shizun!" The newcomer screams.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Neither Shen Jiu nor Liu Qingge hesitates as they stand up and grasp the hilts of their swords, but </span>
<em>
<span>Luo Binghe</span>
</em>
<span> moves swiftly. And the next thing he notices is a claw squeezing his neck and pulling him back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don't," the intruder purrs. Shen Jiu purses his lips, trying to ignore the pressure that takes his breath away. "I didn't hesitate to hurt my shizun and I won't hesitate to hurt this one as well."</span>
</p><p>
<span>In front of them, Liu Qingge and Luo Binghe are tense and with their swords drawn. They both grunt at the same time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I will kill you if you hurt him."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"If you touch shizun I will kill you."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Their coordinated responses make the fake Luo Binghe laugh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I won't if you behave," he promises them. "Too bad, I really wanted to fight the famous War God. In my world you are dead. What a pity."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu stiffens after hearing him. He shouldn't be surprised since he knows that Shen Yuan altered his fate by saving Liu Qingge. But right now the prospect of a world without him is terrifying.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Liu-shishu," he continues. "Leave us. I want to talk to my... counterpart? Little me? According to my calculations, my world is a few years ahead of yours. That makes you my Bing-didi and I’m your Bing-ge."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge grits his teeth furiously before dropping his sword.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"If you hurt him, I will chase you to any other world to destroy you," he growls before turning and walking away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The three of them are left trapped in a tension in which no one dares to move.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Release shizun," Luo Binghe demands with clenched teeth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There is fear in his voice, an immense panic that devours his eyes and turns his knuckles white.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don't be like that! I just want to talk!" Luo Bing-ge snorts but frees him and Shen Jiu breathes a sigh of relief before walking away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His Luo Binghe doesn't hesitate to grab his wrist before pushing him behind his back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What do you want?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Is this how you appreciate that I decided to give you some advice?" Luo Bing-ge sits defiantly in front of the forgotten food. "It's funny. Our worlds are very similar, but there are considerable differences. People who don’t exist in my world, they have different personalities or are dead... I examined the advances of your troops." He clicks his tongue. "Your progress is slow but interesting. Don’t be in a hurry to conquer the world. In the end, you will be the emperor of the three realms and you will run out of fun. This is the most exciting thing that has happened to me in recent years."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Bing-ge sighs dramatically. But the scariest thing is that his Luo Binghe seems to listen to him with interest. Shen Jiu clings to his clothes as if that way he could distract him from those words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Such a slow conquest is tedious, but I think it will have good results. Don't even think about using Xin Mo to merge the two realms. It was a disaster." He sighs again while Shen Jiu pales in horror. "I thought it was a great idea, but it only caused me more trouble. And forcing a physical fusion destroyed a lot of places that I will never be able to visit again. Also, be careful with those around Mobei-Jun. His uncle is a traitor and his pet will betray him… soon. For some inexplicable reason, since the death of that spy rat, he has never been the same again." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Through the cloth, Shen Jiu notices how Luo Binghe tenses when Luo Bing-ge leans forward. He fiddles with chopsticks that no longer seem harmless in his hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Although I am disappointed... We are very similar, but from what I have gathered you are not married yet. Do you also need love advice?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No." He growls like a jealous animal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Too bad. You need them urgently. And I made some mistakes," he snorts. "Too many women who are always fighting over me in the end is annoying. But you don't have any, do you? Don't make a mistake, Bing-di. Take some concubines or you'll never harness the potential of that sword."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I have no intention of taking any concubines." Luo Binghe assures and for the first time the expression of his doppelganger is confused. "I will marry my love and I will always be faithful and devoted to them."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Bing-ge blinks, stunned to hear those words from someone identical to him. When he clenches his fist, the chopsticks break in half. And he throws his head back as he laughs with hysterical, unhinged, mocking laughter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Terrified by that heinous advice, Shen Jiu plucks up the courage to stand in front of Luo Binghe, ignoring the pain in his neck, and challenge that dangerous intruder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"If you don't have anything better to do, get out."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"So cold, shizun!" He scoffs, resting his face on his hand. Luo Bing-ge ignores him. His cruel and boring eyes light up when he looks at his doble. "I know how to resurrect the corpse you keep."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe gasps, Shen Jiu trembles.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It's a lie, right?</span>
</p><p>
<span>It can’t be true.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"But since you're not interested, maybe I should go..." He stands up theatrically.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Bing-ge raises his head. His satisfied smirk is crooked and it makes Shen Jiu tremble.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"But what would you give me in return?” He whispers. “It is not easy to raise the dead."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Everything!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No!" Shen Jiu interferes, glaring at his disciple. "He is playing with you!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"As suspicious as ever, shizun." Luo Bing-ge looks disappointed when he unsheathes his sword. "I'll let you think about my proposal. I'll be back in a few days." His sword cuts the air, but the portal he creates is different than usual. It is a path between worlds. "But Bing-di, remember, my price will be as high as resurrecting a shizun."</span>
</p><p>
<span>And he leaves.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Perhaps Luo Bing-ge has disappeared, but his memory resonates like an echo between them. Shen Jiu puts a hand around his neck, remembering the precision of that gesture and how he wouldn’t have hesitated to hurt him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don't do it," he mutters.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Luo Binghe looks at him confused and tired after a year and a half wasting his qi on preserving a corpse. He is pale and with dark circles under his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I want shizun back." He splutters. His sadness is immense and hurts like Shen Jiu's.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Me too. But we can't trust him."</span>
</p><p>
<span>He stiffens upon hearing his words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Why not? Why can't you trust me!?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don’t be ridiculous! You are not the same person!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Maybe we are! We fought, shizun! It was like facing a mirror!" Tears drown Luo Binghe's eyes. "You abandoned me. You left me alone with no one else to take care of Shen Yuan. Why can't you trust any Luo Binghe?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu opens his mouth, but all of his words have died.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And not even now he is able to confess the truth about Shen Yuan's death.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because deep in his heart, he can’t trust Luo Binghe.</span>

<p>When they tell everything to Liu Qingge, who had waited outside tense and restlessly, his expression darkens with concern. However, the most uncomfortable thing about that situation is that he doesn’t judge Luo Binghe or threaten or yell at him, but instead stares into Shen Jiu's eyes. And his silence is even worse than an accusation. Liu Qingge is wordlessly asking him why he isn't telling the truth about Shen Yuan.</p><p>But Shen Jiu doesn't dare.</p><p>There are secrets that over time grow and become so heavy that it is tiring to carry them, but it is also more difficult to tell to certain people. And Shen Jiu knows that Luo Binghe will hate him for hiding that truth. It's too late and so he clenches his fists and looks away. At least he can try to get his Luo Binghe to change his mind.</p><p>"In exchange for A-Yuan, what would you give in return?"</p><p>Luo Binghe blinks, confused by the unexpected question, but his answer comes immediately.</p><p>"Everything."</p><p>"That’s the problem, Luo Binghe." Shen Jiu sighs. "I can't judge you because I would do the same, but we don't know what Bing-ge wants. Right now, he has more information about us than we do about him. He also knows your desperation to resurrect A-Yuan." Shen Jiu puts a hand on his chin as he thinks. "He has said that he merged both realms. That is a horrific atrocity."</p><p>"Or maybe he meant well but ended badly," Luo Binghe right away defends him. Or he defends himself.</p><p>Shen Jiu trembles as he realizes that perhaps that same idea has already tempted his disciple a long time ago. <em> Later I'll talk to him, we need to solve this problem first. </em></p><p>"It's a disaster that will alter the geography of both realms, creating an entirely new place at the cost of destroying the rest. Perhaps he is interested in something that was lost in his world." Shen Jiu takes a deep breath. "But Luo Bing-ge has also insisted that there are living people in our world who are dead in his. What if he wants someone else in return? Would you still agree, Luo Binghe?"</p><p>This time, his response is slow despite the determined glint in his eyes.</p><p>"Maybe."</p><p>"And do you think it would make A-Yuan happy to find out that you have sacrificed someone innocent for his sake?"</p><p>"I don't care if shizun hates me, at least he will be alive."</p><p>The two challenge each other with the same stubborn and determined gaze. Liu Qingge clears his throat before intervening.</p><p>"Don't think I'll allow another beast like you to kidnap someone," he growls and Luo Binghe responds with a cruel smile.</p><p>"How if shishu never managed to defeat me?"</p><p>"Enough!" Shen Jiu intervenes before the two draw their swords. "Your shishu is right, Luo Binghe. This Master also opposes a stranger from another world abducting someone."</p><p>"I didn't know that Shizun enjoys eating intimately with strangers," his former disciple replies in a sour voice. "What if Bing-ge just wants a treasure? You're the one who doesn't want to trust him and only thinks the worst."</p><p>His throat still burns where the intruder had grabbed him.</p><p>"He is dangerous. You should know: you are the same person in parallel worlds."</p><p>His statement makes Luo Binghe pale and a flash of anger flashes in his eyes and then darkens in disappointment. Shen Jiu turns to Liu Qingge with an uncomfortable feeling inside his chest. Luo Bing-ge's interest in Liu Qingge was unusual. Terrifying. Worrying. If he has to make any conjectures right now, Shen Jiu would bet he wants Liu Qingge in exchange for Shen Yuan.</p><p>And Luo Binghe will hand him over to him without hesitation, that's another clear assurance. Shen Jiu must keep him away from the palace while he tries to find some solution.</p><p>"Shidi, go back to Cang Qiong Mountain Sect." And he adds before Liu Qingge protests. "You have to warn Zhangmen-shixiong of the existence of another world. This Luo Bing-ge has defined himself as the emperor of the three realms. He is dangerous and powerful. The cultivation world must keep alert."</p><p>Liu Qingge reluctantly agrees.</p><p>"I will be back."</p><p>That promise makes him tiny and fragile. Shen Jiu trembles when Liu Qingge reaches his hand to catch his. Immediately, Luo Binghe looms behind Shen Jiu like a shadow.</p><p>"Don’t." Shen Jiu looks away with his heart stuck in his throat. "Do you remember my cat?"</p><p>"Yes." Liu Qingge frowns, confused.</p><p>"Look for him. I think Shang Qinghua and Mu Qingfang have copies of his favorite places. Go back to where you found me and look for my cat."</p><p>Look for Shen Yuan. Because if they find Shen Yuan before Luo Bing-ge returns, then they won't have to negotiate anything. Although their Luo Binghe's reaction will be even more unpredictable, It is preferable.</p><p>Liu Qingge frowns but nods slowly while keeping an eye on Luo Binghe.</p><p>"If the other hurt him again, I'll kill you," he warns him.</p><p>His words put Luo Binghe on the defensive, who bares his teeth like an animal.</p><p>"I will never let anyone hurt shizun."</p><p>"He's already tried, you blind beast." Liu Qingge raises his arm and his fingers brush Shen Jiu's neck without daring to touch more. "If I can't find your cat, I'll be back."</p><p>As always, that's the promise that hurts him the most.</p><p>
<em> Please, don’t come back. </em>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Luo Bing-ge's brief appearance has shattered the tense calm in the palace. In the following days, Luo Binghe's mood worsens. He is more susceptible and aggressive. He identifies Shen Jiu's mistrust of his double as a personal attack and his inordinate attitude destroys the little trust Shen Jiu had regained in him. Their meals become more awkward and the fact of being locked in that palace is more unbearable.</p><p>Luo Bing-ge returns after nine uncomfortable days.</p><p>Shen Jiu is reading in his palace when he notices a terrifying and suffocating demonic energy disturbance. Even the servants who tend to him pale. Shen Jiu drops the book on the table and runs outside. He and his Luo Binghe arrive at the same time.</p><p>And the two find the intruder in the throne room.</p><p>In those nine days, they haven’t only argued, eroding their complicated relationship, they also have accepted a pact between their different opinions. And that is why Shen Jiu steps forward to cover Luo Binghe and face that man's hungry wolf smile, so similar and so different from his disciple. Shen Jiu's expression is sullen and this time he doesn't intend to be fooled.</p><p>"I don't trust you," he warns him.</p><p>"Shizun." His disciple sighs, disappointed that he has broken his promises of patience so soon.</p><p>"Shizun." The other raises an eyebrow, amused. "I understand that it is your brother who is dead. Will you not trust this Lord even though he may resurrect him?"</p><p>"No." Shen Jiu crosses his arms. "Before we agree to any deal, we want to know what you want in return."</p><p>Luo Bing-ge still smiles with that arrogant confidence as he reaches into his robes and pulls out a white jade relic covered in dark energy. His gaze flies from Shen Jiu to his counterpart.</p><p>"I found this artifact in the ruins of the Eternal Night Mountain, deep within the Demonic Realm. You haven't gone there yet, have you?" Luo Binghe shakes his head as he curiously gazes at the relic. "I highly recommend it. It is one of the most interesting treasures I have found, even more than jewels or wives." Shen Jiu twists his lips in disgust upon hearing such dehumanization of a living being. "Thanks to its power, I can negotiate with the demons without being fooled by any of them. Come closer, Bing-di."</p><p>Shen Jiu grabs his sleeve when he walks past him. <em> Be careful </em>, says his worried look. He only lets him go when he nods before stepping in front of the other.</p><p>"How it works?"</p><p>Luo Bing-ge extends his hand and the relic begins to glow. It floats on the palm of his hand, covering them in a golden brightness.</p><p>"As long as we're within his range, neither of us can lie," he explains.</p><p>"Omission is another way to intervene." Shen Jiu intervenes. "What do you want in exchange for Shen Yuan?"</p><p>Luo Bing-ge still doesn't look at him. To him, only exists his other-self.</p><p>"<span>I want you to tell me the indications to achieve something that only you possess: a concrete feeling. In return, I will tell you how to resurrect your other shizun.</span>"</p><p>"Is not enough." Shen Jiu walks to stand next to his disciple. "We want you to resurrect A-Yuan. Then we will confirm that we were deceived."</p><p>"Is your shizun always this suspicious?" Bing-ge mocks, finally paying attention to him. His gaze makes Shen Jiu flinch uneasily. "I don't want to. It is a tedious and complicated method, although with Bing-di power level it won’t be difficult for him. I have no interest in wasting my time: I will tell you how you will resurrect your shizun and before I leave you will give me my answer, deal? "</p><p>"Deal."</p><p>Luo Binghe responds without waiting for the opinion of Shen Jiu, who snorts, more annoyed than worried. Although his suspicion is not softened even when Luo Bing-ge seems to ignore everything he had assumed about him.</p><p>“The Demons' Holy Mausoleum.”</p><p>Those four words make Luo Binghe's eyes widen at the same time as his mouth. Shen Jiu looks at him with impatience and a small hope that grows at the possibility of recovering Shen Yuan a few months ahead of schedule.</p><p>"The Demons' Holy Mausoleum?" He mutters. "Just that? Is it that simple?"</p><p>Luo Binghe still nods in his stupor.</p><p>"How could I forget? I can resurrect shizun if I bring his body to the Demons' Holy Mausoleum..." He babbles with a dry voice.</p><p>Shen Jiu retrieves his fan from his belt and uses it to hit him on the shoulder.</p><p>"Why didn't you think of it earlier!?"</p><p>He's losing control of his calm, but for once he doesn't care. There was a safer and more reliable solution than seeds. There was another possibility waiting for them and Shen Yuan might have already returned. And Shen Yuan can come back, maybe today, maybe tomorrow. Shen Jiu covers his face with both hands as he notices tears in his eyes.</p><p>Then, the relic trembles before a beam of light push Luo Binghe several meters away.</p><p>Of course, Luo Bing-ge lied when he said that the artifact was a lie detector.</p><p>Shen Jiu turns to his disciple, too confused to feel anger or disappointment. But he discovers a golden wall that separates the two of them from Luo Binghe, who stands up in a fury. Wasting no time with stupid questions, Shen Jiu unsheathes his sword and lunges at Luo Bing-ge.</p><p>The demon smirks before dodging him with insulting ease. They hear an intense cracking noise as Luo Binghe's Xin Mo hits the wall.</p><p>"What are you doing!!!?"</p><p>"Wasn't it obvious?" The other demon mocks him. "The price of one shizun is another shizun."</p><p>An icy panic paralyzes Shen Jiu upon hearing him. But when Xiu Ya falls to the ground with a metallic clink, he understands that it is not just fear that numbs his body or the reason why he falls to the ground. It’s those disgusting parasites that swarm in his blood that both demons can manipulate.</p><p>"STAY AWAY FROM HIM!"</p><p>Luo Bing-ge hums with a smile as he reaches down to pick up Shen Jiu with the ease of a toy, a gift that belongs to him. In his arms, he is just a doll that ends up resting against his broad chest while Luo Binghe tries in vain to break through the wall.</p><p>"Don't worry, Bing-di." Despite his lies and deceptions, he seems sincere when he looks at his counterpart one last time. "I'll take better care of him than the other one. Enjoy your other shizun."</p><p>"I'LL KILL YOU!" The wall is covered in cracks bright like lightning. "LEAVE MY SHIZUN!"</p><p>But Luo Bing-ge turns his back and Shen Jiu can no longer see his disciple, just hear his anguished screams. His insides protest when noticing how two forces fight inside him. And he clenches his teeth unable to move, but that pull disappears when Luo Bing-ge uses his sword to open a hole to another reality.</p><p>“SHIZUN!”</p><p>They arrive at an immense palace that ridicules Luo Binghe’s, a pale shadow in comparison. The sky is bright red with flecks of blue, and the stars are mixed in the chaos of various unknown constellations. Demons and humans are waiting for their lord's return with ovations and bows. Some are strangers, others familiar. There is a Mobei-jun just as stoic and quiet as the one he knows. There is a Sha Hualing who laughs when she sees him in the arms of her lord.</p><p>Luo Bing-ge drops with mocking care Shen Jiu on the ground, still frozen in a rigid and inert body, before turning towards the portal. And he brings out a second relic: a red dagger that seems forged with blood. Then, he plunges it into the portal and reddish veins sew it until the path between the two worlds disappears.</p><p>Shen Jiu gasps when he feels that he regains control of his limbs, that his voice belongs to him and nothing is holding him back. However, it’s useless: although he can walk, he has nowhere to run.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>When Liu Qingge returns, he finds the chaos surrounding a raging demon who has smashed everything to open a portal and failed a thousand times. Luo Binghe has his knuckles broken and bloody from hitting the walls while he was screaming and his eyes are bloodshot. His appearance is more beast than human, but Liu Qingge doesn’t flinch, walking even faster.</p><p>"What happened?" He growls. "Where is Shen Jiu?"</p><p>"He has taken him..." He babbles, kneeling on the ground, unable to get up. "He has taken Shizun and I can't get him back... What should I do now?"</p><p>Liu Qingge pales. Panic first dilates his eyes and cuts off his breath. Then rage takes control.</p><p>Luo Binghe only blinks when he punches him in the face.</p><p>"You stupid beast! You had to protect him!"</p><p>Luo Binghe bites his lip. He knows. He knows it perfectly. And that's why he doesn't respond or defend himself but instead waits for Liu Qingge to hit him again. He deserves all the pain and suffering in the world: he allowed one shizun to die and now the other has been stolen.</p><p>But Liu Qingge fidgets hysterically. And although he shoots him angry glances in which the desire to attack him shines, he does nothing.</p><p>"Now you know how I felt," he growls. "Now you know how you feel when the person you love is taken far, far away, where you can't see him and you can't do anything to save him."</p><p>Finally, Luo Binghe reacts by raising his head.</p><p>"Is not the same..."</p><p>"IT'S THE SAME, STUPID LUO BINGHE! Do you finally get it? You're not that different from the other one." Liu Qingge covers his face with his hands before screaming until his lungs are empty. Then, he falls defeated to the ground. "I should have guessed... Why did I leave Shen Jiu alone?"</p><p>"He wasn‘t alone!" Luo Binghe's tears burn in his eyes. "And that's worse ..."</p><p>"He was alone." Liu Qingge looks him into his eyes and despite the distance between them, he seems to be very close. "He was locked away from us because you kidnapped him. Twice. Do you get it now?" He repeats, in frustration and fury.</p><p>Luo Binghe finally gets it.</p><p>Regret is cruel and painful. And its roots begin to conquer the heart of the Demon Lord. It is different from regret for Shen Yuan's death. It's not about what he couldn't avoid but what he has done.</p>

<span>For Shen Jiu, it is clearer now why it took Luo Bing-ge nine days to return. That lying wolf devised his trap very carefully, looking for the elements that would isolate them from his Luo Binghe. Shen Jiu's guts twist as he realizes that he has done something on the way between the two dimensions. And for the first time in many years, he feels tiny and trapped again despite the fact that there are no chains and his false disciple has guided him to elegant and luxurious rooms. Very similar to his palace, his bamboo house.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Both Luo Binghe are so alike that they are almost the same person. Locked against his will for the second time in a palace, Shen Jiu examines the room with disinterest. Frustration still burns in his gut at having misread a person he should know. Although he had also been fooled when Luo Bing-ge arrived despite their differences and earlier he had needed Liu Qingge to understand his disciple.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu sits down with a weary sigh. Anger and fear had burned away leaving regret behind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Everything would have been very different if he had tried to understand Luo Binghe. Shen Jiu failed as a shizun when his rage pushed him into the Endless Abyss and by accepting all of Shen Yuan's words without appreciating that Luo Binghe is a person capable of growth and change.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now he must deal with another, more unpredictable Luo Bing-ge. </span>
<em>
<span>But he is doing the same as my disciple</span>
</em>
<span>, Shen Jiu thinks as he examines the room. </span>
<em>
<span>Maybe I was wrong and Luo Bing-ge is dangerous to others and not to me.</span>
</em>
<span> Absentmindedly, he strokes his neck, wondering if the assault was real or a trap to hide his true intentions.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Bing-ge is a cunning wolf, that's the only clear truth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although the night grows on the other side of the window, devouring the sky in starless darkness, Shen Jiu collects everything he knows and his options. </span>
<em>
<span>I can't run away</span>
</em>
<span>. He frowns as he taps his fingers on the table. </span>
<em>
<span>Because of the damn demon blood, he can find me anywhere. </span>
</em>
<span>And he had had enough of being immobilized twice in such an unpleasant way that it locked him inside his body. Furthermore, as long as he still doesn't understand Luo Bing-ge's true intentions and character, he shouldn't risk angering him. </span>
<em>
<span>I should first investigate the differences between our worlds… and find a way to return.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>After all, no one will rescue him. Although Shen Jiu doesn’t understand what kind of artifacts Luo Binghe used, he intuits that he has done it to prevent otherworldly people from entering this one. That leaves him alone. And it is better to accept it soon than to cling to childish and stupid illusions. Furthermore, Shen Jiu is tired of waiting. He is alone, but he is not helpless. He will find a way back and surely Luo Binghe will have brought Shen Yuan back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu barely knows a few details: the Demon and the Human Realm were merged, Liu Qingge is dead, Luo Binghe is an emperor... Shen Jiu stops his hand. All of that reminds him of Shen Yuan's prophecies.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe mentioned that he hurt the Shen Jiu of this world.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan never made it clear to him what his true destiny was, only that it would be horrible.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Nonsense</span>
</em>
<span>. There is nothing more horrible than his past, although a world without Liu Qingge and Shen Yuan is so terrifying that Shen Jiu feels cold to his bones despite the warm environment. He is shaking. Shen Jiu hugs himself, accepting that he won't sleep that night either.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>The morning begins with deceptive normality, an echo of his life in the other world. Demonic and human servants bring him food and prepare an aromatic bath for him. They also offer him luxurious hairpins and silk robes. Shen Jiu rejects nothing, although he watches over them armed with a meek silence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The door opens and a young woman storm in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"SHIZUN!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu is startled when she lunges into his arms. This Ning Yingying is similar to his Ning Yingying. She has the same eyes, even though she dresses and combs differently. The girl he has seen grow up has become a lady.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shizun!" She whimpers, hugging him even tighter. "A-Luo said that he was going to bring a shizun from another world, but I never imagined... Shizun! You’re here!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu gulps. He has always been weak with his favorite disciple and although Ning Yingying's tears affect him, he cannot forget that that is not his disciple nor is he her shizun. They are two strangers with the faces of people important to them. Still, his heart softens a little when he strokes her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Stop crying," he scolds her. "You're not a child anymore."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ning Yingying sobs, but she lets go of him as she wipes her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I missed you so much, shizun..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>And he understands that the Shen Jiu of this world is dead. It is a certainty that he accepts with indifference and resignation, despite the suspicion that it was surely Luo Bing-ge who killed him. Because information is power. Shen Jiu gazes at the young lady as he wonders if this Ning Yingying is as talkative as the one in his memories. </span>
<em>
<span>I'll have to check</span>
</em>
<span>, he thinks, tilting his head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Ning Yingying." He calls her. And his voice escapes the familiarity and affection he feels for his disciple. "This Master is confused by the differences between our worlds. Could you help me?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Of course!" Her eyes spark, excited with the same childish illusion as when he taught her a new score. "Today is a beautiful day. Shizun can accompany me for a walk in the flower garden."</span>
</p><p>
<span>He nods, eager to leave those rooms and find out what kind of world awaits outside.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ning Yingying babbles as she guides him. Her mood is so bright that it warms the cold that he feels under his skin. Still, his words are empty. She repeats the same phrases and reflects on how much she has missed him. Ning Yingying doesn't talk about the sect or Luo Binghe, but about other women that he doesn't know. Shen Jiu accompanies her without interrupting her, analyzing all of her sentences as he examines their surroundings.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe has built a palace that rivals the heavens. It is more immense than some cities, sparking in gold and jade, although the stone of the buildings is black. Within the walls glitz and power shine, yet Shen Jiu trembles as he walks through that bloody sky.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The garden Ning Yingying leads him to is so beautiful that it almost took his breath away. All the plants are exquisite. Some are familiar to him, others he only knows from legends and there are some unknown, perhaps demonic or extinct. Scattered around the garden, reading or chatting with each other, there are countless women. And they all interrupt what they do to glare at him. Some without disguising, others trying. They are piercing and sharp looks, aggressive without the need for words or blows. Shen Jiu ignores them. None deserve his attention, only Ning Yingying and his clumsy attempts to calm the environment and make him feel comfortable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Look, shizun! A-Luo planted these flowers last year. When they bloom, they will spread golden pollen throughout the entire garden until they cover the sky. I hope that shizun can see it with me. It will be beautiful!" She smiles wistfully. "You know? That tree is the same one from the legends that shizun told me when I was little. A-Luo looked for it for me."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu is unable to contain a fine smile, touched by the enthusiasm of that young woman who hasn’t forgotten his thirst for knowledge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Later I'll take shizun to the lake! There are immortal carps and..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What is this scum doing here?" An unpleasant and cutting voice interrupts Ning Yingying.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But the worst is not those rude words, but that she flinches with an awkwardness that erases her smile and makes her pale. Furious, Shen Jiu turns to face the Little Palace Mistress.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It looks like the world doesn't matter," he comments in his coldest, harshest voice, and his most judgmental look. "You are always doomed to be a spoiled worm with no manners."</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman looks at him with hatred. Her clothes are even more ostentatious and she wears so many jewels that it is even ridiculous. A small golden whip hangs on her belt, which she extends with a snap.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Insolent!" She hisses, waving the whip at his face. "You shouldn't be here!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu parries the blow with the back of his hand. He could have dodged it, but he prefers to show his disdain so that everyone understands how little he respects that woman.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Unfortunately, we both have the same opinion."</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shizun, your hand!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The skin is flushed, but he shakes his hand nonchalantly. No blow from someone so pathetic can affect him, even if his bones are broken or his muscles are torn.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The curiosity of other women is intense and no longer hidden in sidelong glances and discreet whispers. It surrounds them with murmurs that sound like swarms of wasps. The Little Palace Mistress hisses furiously before she sways the whip.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Who do you think you are, Shen Qingqiu? Someone must teach you respect."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I was thinking the same thing. About you." Shen Jiu ignores the moment Ning Yingying starts to tug at his sleeve to shut him up. "First, your posture is wrong. You wave the whip without grace or technique. How did you learn? Hitting animals like the beast that you are?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Hitting dogs like you."</span>
</p><p>
<span>She steps forward angrily, but a melodious voice like bells stops her before she raises her arm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I wouldn't do that. Our lord is quite fond of this version of Shen Qingqiu."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sha Hualing walks towards them with the delicate steps of a predator. However, Shen Jiu isn't fooled by her playful, red-painted smile. She was laughing when Luo Bing-ge brought him to this world and has only intervened to prevent him from receiving physical harm. Surely on Luo Bing-ge's orders. But that didn't make her an ally, perhaps one of his worst enemies.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The demoness holds the whip with her hands ending in sharp nails.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I advise you to wait. Jushang will eventually get tired of him." Sha Hualing turns to give Shen Jiu a cruel smile. "Although, honestly, I don't see the difference between the two Shen Qingqiu."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Not surprising. I don't see any difference between you and the Sha Hualing of my world, either: you are both equally annoying, cocky, and lousy."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Someone laughs in the background. The demoness's smile grows sharper as she turns her back on the Little Palace Mistress to approach him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"And you are as arrogant as the other one. Do you want some advice?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No." Shen Jiu holds her gaze. "But I would appreciate it if someone could explain to me exactly what Luo Bing-ge wants."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I'd like to know that too," another woman interjects.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu is not surprised to find that Qiu Haitang is also there. Still, he trembles and instinctively clenches his fists. Her hatred is terrible precisely because he doesn’t regret what he did. Shen Jiu maintains an icy expression despite Qiu Haitang, his only childhood refuge, approaching them followed by Liu Mingyan. Even though Liu Qingge's sister doesn't speak, her eyes burn with a terrifying hatred that confuses Shen Jiu.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I've already told you, Jushang found him in another world and made the mistake of believing that this Shen Qingqiu is different from the other. He called him nice!" Sha Hualing laughs as the other two trembles with rage and the Little Palace Mistress clicks her tongue. "Maybe he wants to play with him now that his other toy is broken." She turns her back on him and walks away in deliberately short, mischievous steps. "I'll give you my advice even if you don't want it or deserve it, Shen Qingqiu: learn your place. Jushang can be kind or..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>She doesn't finish the sentence and that pause invokes all kinds of possibilities. The demoness turns her head to look into his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I can tell you. But maybe you don't believe me. Or you won't care."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What are you talking about?" He groans, crossing his arms to hide his unease reflected in his clenched fists.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"About what happened to the other you."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"He's dead, right? Luo Bing-ge killed him."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sha Hualing smiles like a cat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Maybe not. Maybe yes. Maybe he cut you thousand times so you would slowly bleed out. Or maybe he buried you alive." She savors another pause, searching his expression for any hint of discomfort. "Do you dare to find out, Shen Qingqiu?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ning Yingying grabs his arm so tightly that she digs her nails into him, destabilizing him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don't do it, shizun." She whispers to him, her pupils dilated in panic and her face white as snow. "Don't listen to her. We can visit the lake. Going to the garden was a bad idea..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Shen Jiu ignores her trembling voice to lift his head arrogantly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Show me."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although most of those women watch it with curiosity, they are irrelevant, more decorative flowers than real persons. However, those four are dangerous predators. Perhaps Luo Bing-ge has kidnapped him on a whim and he won’t harm him, but they will not hesitate to confront him, to humiliate him, to make him pay for the crimes that he shares with his other self. He must show them that he is not afraid and nothing they do will affect him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Marvelous."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sha Hualing's smile is as sharp as a dagger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ning Yingying doesn’t dare to accompany them. She stands in the garden with her head down and her fingers twisting the fabric of her dress. The Little Palace Mistress also doesn’t join them, instead, she sits under a gazebo.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It stinks too much for me," she excuses herself waving a perfect-nailed hand. "See you later, Shen Qingqiu. I hope you will act more respectfully next time."</span>
</p><p>
<span>He responds by rolling his eyes. And he follows Sha Hualing, Qui Haitang, and Liu Mingyan out of the garden, who guide him down a narrow path hidden among the beautiful palaces. Shen Jiu suspects that this is a secret path that they shouldn’t know about.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His curiosity grows when they reach a dungeon. Although his heart constricts as he remembers the occasion when he released Shen Yuan from the Water Prison, he walks nonchalantly. However, with each step, he realizes that the other Shen Qingqiu must be alive. There is no point in keeping a corpse locked up. Sha Hualing scoffs when he frowns, surely misinterpreting him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But they don’t guide him to common cells or a Water Prison, but they go downstairs carved out of the rock. The atmosphere is so cold that it pierces his bones despite the layers of clothing. Soon, a stink of rot rises like dust. Shen Qingqiu wrinkles his nose and covers his face with a sleeve.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Before it was worse." Sha Hualing explains with a malicious glint in her eyes. "Unless you appreciated the smell of blood, in that case, it was delicious... Here. We have arrived." His sharp nails brush against a door. "It's too bad you're late. He can't speak anymore."</span>
</p><p>
<span>The door opens. Shen Jiu is suspicious of a trap. It stinks like a corpse, but not even Luo Bing-ge is so insane to preserve the body of his former master in such deplorable conditions. Seeing that he doesn’t enter, Liu Mingyan slaps his back with an open palm, pushing him away. Shen Jiu hisses before looking at her, but not even his anger overshadows that inhuman and inexplicable hatred that distorts her expression to make the young woman a stranger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And finally, he ignores them to face the horror that Luo Binghe has hidden deep within his palace.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At first, he only sees a thing hanging from several chains. But under the dirt, there is a human body. Incomplete. Without arms. Without legs. Just a pathetic dangling torso with eyes closed. One of his lids is wrinkled as if the eye socket is empty. The thing is rotting. But the thing is alive. Shen Jiu begins to run out of air. Though weakly, that thing's chest heaves. His breathing is raspy. Maybe because his lungs are also shattered and rotten. His breathing is so soft that it’s almost nonexistent. But it exists.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because that thing is alive, its humanity is stripped of brutal wounds. That thing should be dead, but it languishes silently. The cold devours the thing and only his own blood protects his fragile and skeletal body.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The thing is not even aware that they are there, that Sha Hualing laughs. And her laughter resounds like the echo of bells.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu is paralyzed. Horror keeps him from staring at that nasty monster thing, so horrible that nausea creeps up his throat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He is that thing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu trembles with no air in his lungs, dizzy from the sight of the thing and that putrid stink. He stumbles. And his eyes stop on something shining on the ground.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Something metallic.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shards.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shiny and metallic shards.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Perhaps from a weapon.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A sword.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Xuan Su.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There's a scream stuck in his throat, mixed with nausea and a sob, but he only lets out an inhuman, bestial gasp. The world around him blurs and his heart races and his lungs expand and yet he feels like he's drowning. That he is that thing and that is why he cannot move or run away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A few tears cover his eyes as Shen Jiu turns to flee. But there is no one. The door is closed. They have locked him up with that thing and he hears Sha Hualing giggling on the other side of the door and the voices of Qiu Haitang and Liu Mingyan wishing him a slow and painful death. But the thing is not dead and Shen Jiu wishes it is. Death is preferable, death is sweet. He was kind in condemning the Qiu to just disappear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His fists hurt. He is knocking on the door without realizing it. Because he needs to flee before his brain understands all that MEANS THAT THING AND THE SHARDS OF XUAN SCATTERED ON THE GROUND, AS COLD AS THE CORPSE OF...</span>
</p><p>
<span>The door opens.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shizun!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ning Yignying cries, but she is not the one who holds him, but the very person who created the thing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s the meaning of that?” Luo Bing-ge growls and his voice surrounds him. His presence is everywhere, and Shen Jiu cannot get rid of him even if he tries to slap or kick him. His hands hold his shoulders tightly, but he is ignoring him as he scolds the other three. "This Lord thinks it was clear when I said that this Shen Qingqiu is not like ours."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It was a joke!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Ling'er..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"He was acting so annoying and arrogant! He must understand where he is now."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"That's a lie! Shizun and I were just taking a walk!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>All of their voices mingle in a diffuse echo that Shen Jiu hears without understanding. He has closed his eyes while he tries to control his breathing.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>This is the fate that Shen Yuan was trying to change.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu is still tense, panic gnawing at his insides, but he straightens up and slaps Luo Binghe aside.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don't touch me." He hisses in disgust. And fear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nobody talks anymore. Ning Yingying shifts her weight from one foot to the other, uncomfortable and restless, Sha Hualing's smile is more insecure, and Luo Bing-ge's expression darkens. He moves and one arm wraps around his shoulders to lead him away from the dungeon while he closes the door with his other hand. That dry sound reverberates inside his ribs and Shen Jiu knows that he will keep thinking about the thing no matter how much he tries to run away. The memory of that ghastly sight, that smell, the brilliance of Xuan Su's shards, are locked inside his head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don't worry, shizun." He promises him with a poisonous whisper and a smile that Shen Jiu would want to destroy with his nails. "If you behave well, you will be safe."</span>
</p><p>
<span>The threat paralyzed his bones with a tenacity worse than demon blood. Shen Jiu doesn't dare reject him when Luo Bing-ge pulls him toward him in a hug that is intended to be comforting. But it is cruel and painful.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Next time you'll be punished, Ling'er. I don't want any of you to bother shizun anymore, is it clear?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yes, husband." Several voices mutter at the same time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Good. Now let's get out of here."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu feels like a doll being dragged outside. And although it is a beautiful day, he still has the cold of the prison inside his body. His mouth tastes like bile and he keeps shaking. Ning Yingying, aware of his discomfort, takes his hand. Her skin is warm and she rubs her fingers gently over the injury.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Let's go to the lake, shizun. You'll love it."</span>
</p><p>
<span>She speaks with the desperation of someone who wants to ignore the thing that Luo Binghe keeps in his palace. And he finally recognizes the differences between this Ning Yingying's smile and her disciple. Only one is really happy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu doesn't pull her away but instead turns his head to look into Luo Bing-ge’s eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What do you want of me?" He finally dares to ask.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His voice is hoarse from all the screams that he hasn’t been able to release.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The Demon Lord leans down to stroke his cheek with mocking care.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Your affection."</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan died thinking that his sacrifice would fix everything. However, when he awakens his world is in chaos.</span>

<p>
<span>It's an ordinary awakening despite the ground in which he nearly drowns when he opens his mouth, gasping. Shen Yuan scrambles to escape this embrace of mud, leaves, and soil. And when he breathes the crisp air of the bamboo forest, his first thought after he dies is: </span>
<em>
<span>Shen Jiu is going to kill me.</span>
</em>
<span> He is a mess who hardly looks like a person. Although his body is lithe and strong, his skin is covered in mud scabs and his hair is dirty and tangled, so long that he trips when he tries to get up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His first steps are staggering. That is a body that has never walked, that has never eaten or spoken. His heartbeat is impatient and fearful, his lungs expand and the air smells with a unique intensity that makes him dizzy. All the stimuli around him are sharper than ever, even though Shen Yuan is someone who has already died twice and this will be his third life.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Terrified of being discovered in such a disgraceful state, he sneaks off to the bamboo house. Despite his plans to travel the world, Shen Yuan had chosen to cultivate his seed at Qing Jing Peak. There are many reasons that he would use to justify his decision, but the truth is that he did it out of laziness: it is close, it is a place rich in qi and he could monitor the state of his body without moving away. And at that moment, naked and stunned by so many sensations, Shen Yuan appreciates it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Of all the people he is avoiding, Mister Shen Perfect Jiu is the first. Shen Yuan passes through the bamboo forest in silence on a side road. He breathes a sigh of relief as he reaches the bamboo house without being discovered. </span>
<em>
<span>Oh, the damage has been fixed, </span>
</em>
<span>he observes. That's a good sign. No wars, no dramas. Qing Jing Peak is as calm as ever and he will soon regain his peaceful life. His brother has escaped PIDW's original fate and Luo Binghe has yet to commit any atrocity. Everyone can be happy now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The house is trapped by a cold silence. Everything is just as he remembers it, so his transition must have been brief. Hopefully, Shen Jiu won't scold him much and will only punish him by copying some poem. Shen Yuan walks through the rooms carefully so as not to dirty anything up. After getting clean clothes, he prepares a hot bath and indulges in that comforting pleasure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>(Although ripping out all the filth is costly and soon the bath turns into torture.)</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan only leaves the house when he is presentable again in his green robes, the fan that Liu Qingge gave him at his waist, and his hair in a hairpin gifted from his brother. At first, he wanted to wait for Shen Jiu to come back, but his nerves are nibbling at his stomach. It is the presentiment that reproach in the form of a storm is approaching. Waiting is stressful and overwhelming. Shen Yuan decides to pluck up his courage and go outside to look for Shen Jiu and find out what happened to Luo Binghe after his self-destruction.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He didn’t imagine that, upon seeing him, his disciples would run towards him like a bunch of ducklings and jump on him. Too much enthusiasm! He has never been dead! Why those tears?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although their relief affects his heart. Fluffy cloud-like happiness spreads across his chest as he smiles.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Stop crying, this Master has returned." He tries to reassure them, distributing head pats randomly. "Why those long faces? It was only a temporary absence!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We thought shizun was dead," Ming Fan cries.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"With how terrifying Jiu-Ge is? This Master would never have dared! And he wouldn't have left me... C'mon, I'm here. That's what matters, right?" Shen Yuan is looking for someone who is not a mess of tears and snot. The perfect candidate is Gongyi Xiao, who remains a bit distant, his eyes wet and his head bowed in embarrassment. "How long have I been out?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe caused a lot of damage with his uncontrolled qi, in addition to the fact that his disciples would not be training calmly the day after a quasi-invasion, so Shen Yuan deduces that the soul change hasn’t been immediate. Maybe he's only been away for a few days...</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Responding to Master Shen, you have been absent for a year and a half."</span>
</p><p>
<span>His smile disappears and all his words are drowned out in unintelligible noise. Shen Yuan clears his throat as his thoughts spiral into a confusing maelstrom. That is too long! Normal that his disciples are treating him like a ghost!</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This Master apologizes. I... I didn't think it would take me that long to come back..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>His voice dies at the thought of Shen Jiu. And Liu Qingge, Luo Binghe, and everyone else. Embarrassed and enraged by the stupid magical rules of that world, Shen Yuan clenches his fists and restrains himself from covering his face with one hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But... maybe it wasn't bad. Qing Jing Peak is still perfect, the sect is as always. Perhaps that time of absence has allowed Luo Binghe to make amends with his brother and Cang Qiong Peak. After regaining his enthusiasm, he looks back at Gongyi Xiao.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What happened after I self-destroyed? Did they burn my body?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t an actual death and Shen Yuan didn’t deserve a real funeral, but he would be excited if paper money had been burned for him. However, the young man twists his new green uniform with shaking hands and warns that nothing was as he expected. Perhaps Shen Jiu was so furious that he buried his corpse in the Demon Realm?</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Well..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"That bastard Luo Binghe took Shizun's corpse!" Ming Fan intervenes, interrupting his awkward murmur. "He kidnapped the other shizun too!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"HE DID WHAT?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>His pulse quickens and those old fears that he believed he had abandoned in his other body return to the horror that the story has continued. With jerking movements in panic, Shen Yuan pushes away the disciples who are still crying to demand the truth from the rest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What happened? Is my brother okay?"</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Is he alive? Is he whole? Is he free or rotting in the infamous Water Prison?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan is getting dizzy as the book begins to turn real. The gore descriptions that he was so passionate about now make him nauseous. And his disciples, led by Ning Yingying, Ming Fan, and Gongyi Xiao speak at the same time in cacophonic chaos.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Liu-shishu went to rescue shizun..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"But Luo Binghe defeated him!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I heard that A-Luo defeated Liu-shishu twice..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Liu-shishu was in seclusion for a year. We don't know why..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"But then he rescued shizun!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We were able to visit shizun. He was..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Sad."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Strange."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Mu-shishu said that he was sick."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"A disease that at first we did not know, but we were investigating!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Although shizun never responded to our letters, he always seemed happy to see us."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"After a year, Liu-shishu managed to rescue him."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We were ready to defend shizun from Luo Binghe!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"But then shizun disappeared!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We tried to search for him, but demons and monsters attacked us and endangered people!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"After several months, Liu-shishu found shizun."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"But Luo Binghe captured shizun again and took him to the Demon Realm."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We don't know what happened, only that Liu-shishu came and went to take care of Luo Binghe's shizun."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"But..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Something has happened."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We don't know exactly what."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Only that shizun is in danger."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"All the Peak Lords and Luo Binghe have gathered at Qiong Ding Peak."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"There is a meeting right now!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan gets up although their voices echo in his head senselessly, only a thunderous noise that leaves him deaf and dizzy. Despite his confusion, he doesn't hesitate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Ming Yinginying, I need you to take me to Qiong Ding Peak."</span>
</p><p>
<span>The absence of a sword is not going to stop him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Ning Yingying also doesn’t doubt to unsheathe her spirit sword.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The sect is the same as before his self-destruction, but Shen Yuan finally understands that everything is different. The others have changed and so much has happened that not even Ning Yingying's report, more calm and orderly, clarifies his questions. Shen Yuan doesn’t understand why Shen Jiu has suffered even though he knew that he would return or how Mu Qingfang has identified a depression that shouldn’t exist at that time. He also doesn't want to believe that the War God was defeated or that something terrifying has forced them to ally with a Luo Binghe who almost repeats what he did in the book.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And his brother has disappeared.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Something stronger than Luo Binghe has taken him and that shouldn't be possible.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No one manages to stop him when he lands on Qiong Ding Peak. Shen Yuan walks with steps between furious and terrified until he reaches where the Peak Lords have gathered. The doors open with intensity and he enters still dragging that emotional chaos.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shen Jiu?" Someone mutters.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"WHERE THE HELL IS MY BROTHER? WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING WHILE I WAS AWAY !?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shen Yuan!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>He has no time for their questions or confused looks. His brother is missing and he needs answers. Upon stumbling upon Luo Binghe's expression, Shen Yuan begins to tremble.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What happened? What did you do? Why...?" Furious, he covers his face with a sleeve so that no one will see him cry. That body is so sensitive that his emotions grow out of control. "Why didn't you protect him...?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shizun... This disciple..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>His voice collapses into a strangled groan. Even though his appearance breaks with every step, Luo Binghe approaches him turned into someone different than the demon from last time. It is no longer madness that affects him, but a terrible sadness that leaves Shen Yuan speechless. Suddenly, Luo Binghe drops to the ground and bows to him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This disciple is sorry. It's my fault... I couldn't protect shizun!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>The protagonist is crying. His body trembles, shaken by tears and exhaustion that he never imagined in Luo Binghe. Everything is wrong, but that's the worst. It breaks the illusion of being part of a written story to sink into the murky waters of unpredictable real life.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan turns as Liu Qingge approaches them with clenched fists and a livid face. He is also suffering, although his feelings are much less intense but just as real as those of the demon.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You’re back... Are you real?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yes, Liu-shidi."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge does something as incomprehensible as Luo Binghe's bow: he hugs him. It is too strong and leaves him gasping for air and protesting, but it is also a desperate hug and Shen Yuan notices his dry throat realizing that his decision was perhaps not perfect.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Please, can someone tell me what happened to my brother?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>The truth that awaits him was neither pleasant nor hopeful. It breaks everything he believed in the world of the book and awakens his worst nightmares about torture and mutilation. They don't know what it means. Only Shang Qinghua knows in detail the world he built and later destroyed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan becomes dizzy, almost losing consciousness, and two pairs of arms hold him down. For a moment, he is grateful. But he's too tense to be distracted by nonsense.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What were you fighting for?" Shen Yuan hisses. "Why did you leave my brother alone?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Even though Liu Qingge and Luo Binghe bow their heads in regret, they are both furious and glare at each other with hatred.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This disciple recently discovered that shizun wasn't dead. No one told me the truth."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Because you kidnapped Shen Jiu first! Twice! You isolated him from the sect and poisoned him with your blood."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Stop!" Shen Yuan interrupts them, too hysterical to think about the consequences of their actions. Besides, it no longer matters: he is not the perfect Shen Qingqiu, but the millennial who argued about horrible books. "I want my brother back."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe clenches his fists and bites his lip until he bleeds.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This disciple has not been able to open a way to the other world. It is closed..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh, don’t worry." Shen Yuan looks around for Shang Qinghua, who is trying to hide behind Yue Qingyuan. "I will find a way." He promises in a cold, sharp voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At PIDW there was always a solution to impossible problems. And for the first time in his life, Shen Yuan is willing to accept a Deus Ex Machina if it returns him to his brother.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>When he was a child, Shen Jiu made the mistake of waiting for Qi-Ge. He waited and waited, as the days turned into years and the torture ripped apart his body and doomed his future. He waited and waited, while he collected wounds that still accompany him like invisible scars. He waited… until he reached his limit and everything burned. He broke. Even though he was lucky to not die, he broke into a thousand pieces that turned him into an unhappy person, who fought for ambitions that would rot when they were achieved.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Shen Yuan died, he waited again. And for a year he lost control of his life, he let his disciple become a huge problem, and all his fears caught him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This time, Shen Jiu won't wait.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He has learned his lesson and will not make the same mistake anymore. He won’t wait for an impossible rescue as long as the world is sealed by Luo Bing-ge's spell (and a part of him knows that they will never look for him since now they already have Shen Yuan). He won't surrender to his worst emotions again until he becomes another Luo Bing-ge’s doll.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It's strange, but after a long time, Shen Jiu feels alive thanks to having a goal in mind. They still don't know what a furious Qing Jing Peak strategist can do.</span>

<p>
<span>Shang Qinghua trembles, pale and scared, when Shen Yuan glares at him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I need a fucking explanation. Now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They are at An Ding Peak. The smell of ink and tea and the quiet of the room create a bubble of deceptive peace. But outside those walls, the world is in chaos and Shen Yuan is still trying to understand everything that has happened in his absence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What other Luo Binghe? There is only one inimitable protagonist! This didn’t happen in the original work!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Ehhmh..." Shang Qinghua wrings his hands nervously. "Based on their descriptions... I think he's... (don't kill me cucumber bro) my original son."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"That can't be possible! In PIDW there was never a plot like this. Maybe it's an illusion? There were twenty subplots in which Luo Binghe's worst fears come true and he loses some of his wives to an illusion... But it doesn't make sense because Luo Binghe isn't gay. "</span>
</p><p>
<span>"About that..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Maybe it's another plot by whoever set us up with the sowers?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Cucumber bro, please!" It is the first time that Shang Qinghua has yelled at him and Shen Yuan blinks, confused. "Why did you want to talk to me if you don't listen to me? Jiu bro has been kidnapped by a Luo Binghe that looks like the original one. The description matches: the only person capable of hurting and surpassing Luo Binghe is another Luo Binghe."</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Shen Yuan doesn't want to believe it. Everything that has happened during his absence is a blurred shadow. For him all that time has been only an instant, not almost two years. The only certainty is that his brother is not there and he feels nauseous at the thought that he has ended up in the original book.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You are all hysterical." He speaks with false calm. "A lot has happened in the last few days and your point of view is not reliable. Perhaps you have been too quick to make conclusions."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It hasn't been </span>
<em>
<span>days</span>
</em>
<span>, Cucumber bro. It's been a year and a half."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Unable to accept it, Shen Yuan waves his hand to dismiss it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We have to be reasonable. In PIDW there were no other worlds. Besides, it's just a book! It can’t be real!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Now we live here! It's real! And the book has already changed. Look around you! Shen Qingqiu shouldn't have a brother, Liu Qingge should be dead, and Luo Binghe's obsession with his two shizuns is different. Everything is different! It's no longer </span>
<em>
<span>Proud Immortal Demon Way</span>
</em>
<span>. After all these changes, why do you have a hard time accepting that something unpredictable has happened? "</span>
</p><p>
<span>"But this breaks the suspension of disbelief! And Luo Bing-ge would be acting OOC if he kidnapped my brother."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"After reading and analyzing my book, have you still not realized my son's obsession with Shen Qingqiu?" Shang Qinghua rubs the bridge of his nose. "I may have been a bad author, but you are an even worse reader."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Offended, Shen Yuan blushes as he opens his mouth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What!?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No, now you are going to listen to me." He interrupts him with an unexpected boldness. "Maybe </span>
<em>
<span>Proud Immortal Demon Way</span>
</em>
<span> wasn't the best book, but it turned out like this because readers wanted porn and a ridiculously large harem. I had plans, plots, and character backdrops. But nobody cared! Writing about the heavenly pillar Luo Binghe paid my bills, that's the reality." Shang Qinghua takes a deep breath before continuing to speak. "Your comments were always funny. Unpleasant, unfair, and very rude too. Whenever I read them, I felt that at least someone was aware that the shitty system we live in had destroyed my story. But it also frustrated me knowing that I could never write about certain things that would have shut your mouth. And now here we are! You have changed the plot, you appreciate the character you hated the most, and yet you still don't understand anything."</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s not true!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You are one of those who considered that Binghe did nothing wrong! But he did! Revenge is not justice. Shen Qingqiu wasn’t a good person, but nothing he did justify that ending. Still, you wanted more, do you remember? " He accused him in a cold voice. "My book was about circles of abuse. You could write 10,000 words criticizing the internal coherence of the story but you never realized a message as obvious as that."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Because Shen Qingqiu is different from Jiu-ge..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"They're not! They are the same person! The problem is that you can forgive even the most horrible crime if it is done by someone you care about. In the past, you wrote a lot of hatred against Shen Qingqiu when discovering the story of Qiu Haitang. But... Did you even react this time? Or were you too happy that your brother recognized you? "</span>
</p><p>
<span>His cheeks burn, covered in an embarrassed and angry blush. Shen Yuan clenches his fists on his knees. It is getting harder to meet Shang Qinghua's gaze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Your beloved Luo Binghe was an unreliable narrator," he continues. "You should know by now. It doesn't matter what Shen Qingqiu did to him, he killed a lot more people, he..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yes, I understand that." Shen Yuan hisses. "Jiu-ge is not as bad as the book portrayed him."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You know now. As a reader, you never commented on the incoherence of Luo Binghe condemning Shen Qingqiu for mistreatment, murder, and lust when he was the worst abuser, murderer, and lustful man."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We're drifting off-topic! We need to save Jiu-ge. He hasn't done anything wrong, we can't leave him alone!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan needs to believe in other plots and alternatives because imagining his brother with the original Luo Binghe is too scary and painful.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"So, you're finally assuming that your beloved protagonist is not a good person. Congratulations." Despite the sarcasm, Shang Qinghua breathes a sigh of relief.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I still consider Luo Binghe's appearance to be absurd," he mutters through clenched teeth. "And it doesn't make sense: he has already had his revenge, why does he want my brother?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shang Qinghua rests his elbows on the table as he covers his face with both hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No. You still don't understand anything." He whimpers. "Did you never suspect anything after so many analyzes complaining that Luo Binghe neglected his wives? His love for them was brief, his hatred for Shen Qingqiu eternal. If he is the Luo Binghe at the end of the book, do you think he will miss this opportunity to retrieve a perfectly good Shen Qingqiu? "</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This is your fault for writing the story!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yeah, it's the author's fault for writing Luo Binghe and Shen Jiu for being the villain. But everything Luo Binghe does is perfect!" His sarcastic tone returns. "Being the protagonist doesn't always prove you right. Luo Binghe was an imperfect protagonist and no hero."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Well, the Shen Qingqiu in the book did do some things wrong... But I tried to prevent my brother from making the same mistakes! Our Binghe is good and the other is not." He reasonably exposes. "So, the problem is not Luo Binghe's nature."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Why are you so dense when you put your mind to it? Where should I start? Everything you don't see doesn't mean it doesn't exist. A lot of things have happened and you have the problem of jumping to the wrong conclusions because you don't see the complete image."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Can we stop being distracted and find a way to save my brother?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No, because you need to remove the blindfold and see reality as it is. Shall we start with </span>
<em>
<span>Proud Immortal Demon Way</span>
</em>
<span>? Tell me, did something strange happen when you saved Liu Qingge in the Lingxi Caves?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan frowns.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"He was suffering from a qi deviation."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Was that mentioned in the book?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"...no."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"But it also happened. However, the readers only had the point of view of Luo Binghe, who didn't know many details. So, now, can you guess what actually happened between Shen Qingqiu and Liu Qingge in my book?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>The image of the original character treacherously murdering his shidi fades, replaced by his own memories in which Liu Qingge attacked him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Next: the demonic invasion. Readers still didn’t know that Liu Qingge was dead. Shen Qingqiu had survived a Peak Lord in a murderous state when he found the sect was in danger. Thanks to his deal with Sha Hualing, Cang Qiong Sect had no losses. What do you think his logic was during the three fights? "</span>
</p><p>
<span>"He was the first because it was an assured victory. Afterward, Liu Mingyan volunteered and he didn’t object."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Liu Mingyan was Liu Qingge's sister and the main disciple of Xian Shu Peak. He assumed that she would win. However, Liu Mingyan lost and that cornered him. Do you still think that he chose Luo Binghe because he expected him to be killed instead of choosing who would win and save the sect?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan notes a bitter taste in his dry throat. Uncomfortable, he ducks his head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"But he mistreats Luo Binghe daily..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Most of the mistreatment was ignoring the harassment of the other disciples because Shen Qingqiu doesn't care about him and that's the truth. He was indifferent and... he also had problems in the past. Circles of abuse. Shen Jiu was repeating what he was taught. Or did you never suspect anything strange about the story of Qiu Haitang? A former slave killing so many people, but leaving others alive. If it had been a cold crime, there would be no survivors. But there were. Specifically, his former fiancée who claimed that he was well treated. That only leaves two possibilities: first, it was not intentional. Second, it was intentional but Qiu Haitang deserved to live and the others did not. Do you have other conclusions besides an analysis of why Shen Qingqiu is a monster that deserved torture? "</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You never wrote any of this," he murmured, unable to meet his eyes anymore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Because you didn't want a villain with a background, but gore and porn." He mumbled with an ancient grudge. "Lastly, the Alliance Conference. Why push your disciple into the Abyss when you could have killed him? No one would have suspected anything, a lot of disciples died that day. Luo Binghe survived because Shen Qingqiu never intended to kill him."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"He pushed him to hell!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"And you would have done it too because the System asked you to!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I planned to prepare him and convince him to come down, not cause him trauma!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Your plan was to deceive him.” Shang Qinghua huffs. “You can still believe yourself morally superior because in both cases your brother did it. This part has happened twice, why do you think that both times did Shen Qingqiu push Luo Binghe to the Abyss instead of killing the demon?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No, no, they are different situations!" Shen Yuan exclaims, gesturing with his hands. "Jiu-ge did it to protect me. If Luo Binghe didn't end up in the Abyss, I would have died."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"In </span>
<em>
<span>Proud Immortal Demon Way</span>
</em>
<span>, he did it to protect the sect. If Luo Binghe didn’t end up in the Abyss, the other sects would have accused the Cang Qiong Sect of sabotage."</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>"As I already told you: </span>
<em>
<span>Proud Immortal Demon Wa</span>
</em>
<span>y was a book about repeating circles of abuse. Shen Qingqiu wasn’t a good person by any means, but neither was he evil and heartless person. He needed therapy. Luo Binghe as well." Shang Qinghua sighs. "I could tell you about all the plots I could never write, but it doesn't matter. Now that you understand the book better, let's get to your second mistake: your Luo Binghe is not a good person. Although, he is not evil either."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan's last memories are blurred like a dream. And he consciously decides to ignore the betrayal when Luo Binghe used his blood, betraying his trust.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It's Xin Mo's fault."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"If you know, do something! Your brother ordered to reform Zheng Yang, now you convince your disciple to leave Xin Mo."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"He will never give up his golden finger!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"So, so the blame is not on the sword but on the ambition of the one who wields it?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan chokes on his own words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"That may also be Xin Mo's fault..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"See? You're doing the same thing again: defending Luo Binghe by blaming everyone else. Aren't there many coincidences that Luo Binghe’s only guilt is choosing the worst sword, having the worst shizun, and being written by the worst writer? Give him some credit!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Embarrassed, Shen Yuan bows his head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Sorry for calling you a bad writer." He apologizes. "I didn't know about that when I read the book."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Well, all the books are written by real people. And even if the story sucks, that doesn't excuse trolls and haters to not have empathy."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I'll talk to Luo Binghe about the sword. Still, Xin Mo is messing with his head."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Xin Mo affects his decisions, that's true. We will all be safer if we get rid of the sword. But don't forget: Xin Mo tempts him with his wishes. Shall we now talk about everything your disciple has done while you were dead?" Shang Qinghua gives him a disapproving look, like a teacher angry at a mischievous child. "First, steal your body and kidnap your brother. For a year. And I hope you apologize to Jiu bro because he has been going through depression and a grieving disorder all this time. And that was not just the writer's fault." He accuses him in a sharp voice. "Luo Binghe has seriously injured Liu Qingge and threatened the sect. He used to attack us to force Jiu bro to return to his side. The second time he kidnapped him, he forced him to give his blood. If Jiu bro wouldn't have been isolated in his palace, Luo Bing-ge wouldn't have had it so easy to kidnap him."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"If he's the original lead, nothing would have stopped him..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"But perhaps it would have been different if Liu Qingge or Yue Qingyuan had been around." Shang Qinghua sighs. "However, the first thing you did when you returned was scolding Liu Qingge and Luo Binghe as if they were both equally responsible."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I still didn't know anything about this!" Shen Yuan defends himself. "They were both acting like angry cats while my brother was missing!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Be more careful next time." Shang Qinghua pauses and all of his aggressiveness and resentment disappear with hesitation. "I have been helping Mu Qingfang so he can understand therapy and mental illness. Shen Jiu needed it and he has improved a lot."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Why do I have the impression that you are hiding something from me?" Shen Yuan squints his eyes and looks at him suspiciously. "You know your characters very well. Why has Jiu-ge suffered if he knew that my death was not real?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I better tell you that when he comes back, okay?" The author clears his throat nervously. "The point is that Luo Binghe also needs therapy. Mu Qingfang has tried to help him, but he has always refused. Tell him. He will listen to you. Tell him to put down that sword and that Mu Qingfang can help him control his emotions. Demons are by nature more aggressive and cruel, but he is half-human. Theoretically, it should be easier for him to learn how to control his inner demons."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan doesn't say anything. He feels as if all the author's words occupy the space of the room and crush him until he is breathless. Since he had awakened, confusion and fear have kept him in a state of disconnection from reality. Or maybe that disconnect exists from the start. After all, he was the idiot who died dedicating his last words and thoughts to a book that he could choose whether to read or not.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>At least being a hater served to pay Airplane's bills</span>
</em>
<span>, he thinks resentfully against himself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The worst thing is that all that discussion has been of no use because his brother is still lost too far and if it is true that he is in the clutches of Luo Bing-ge, he may never see him again. Or maybe he doesn't get him whole and Shen Yuan trembles. The entire time, his motivation was to avoid that ending. Yet is his brother, someone he sincerely appreciates, who may suffer from it. And that's not fair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It never was and Shen Yuan finally gets it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You are the damn author. You invented this world, how can I get Jiu-ge back?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shang Qinghua scratches his forehead.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Do you think I haven't been pondering about it all this time? From what I can gather, my son very carefully devised the trap. Not only did he look for an artifact capable of restraining Xin Mo while he kidnapped Jiu bro, but he has also found a method to block the path between the two dimensions. Our Luo Binghe has been trying all this time and still hasn't succeeded."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fear crushes his lungs, his stomach twists, and nausea creeps up his throat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"There must be some way!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Perhaps! But I have no idea! I was writing 10,000 words in one day, believe me, my brain forgot all the fucking worldbuilding."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"But not me." Shen Yuan frowns. "You say that Luo Bing-ge has locked the dimensions? So, he has decided to use something very specific. Perhaps, if I find the artifact, we can reopen the dimensions."</span>
</p><p>
<span>His only hope is a tiny possibility, but Shen Yuan clings to it desperately. Anxious, he bids farewell to the author to run to Qing Jing Peak and search for his books. According to the description given to him, the artifact that Luo Bing-ge used as a barrier is the same one from a subplot in which a demonic chief handed him a trap. </span>
<em>
<span>It would be logical that Luo Bing-ge chose another well-known relic,</span>
</em>
<span> Shen Yuan deduces. </span>
<em>
<span>And we both know the same.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>He is walking down the slope of An Ding Peak when he sees Liu Qingge and Luo Binghe, the two of them engulfed in dense silence and caught by the same looks of hatred. Although Shen Yuan smiles unconsciously upon seeing them, his heart freezes as he remembers Shang Qinghua's words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe is no longer an adorable puppy, but an untamed beast.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shidi, Luo Binghe, what are you doing here?" he asks them, approaching them with restless steps. "Do you have any news?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Liu Qingge shakes his head and all his hopes die.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shizun seemed very confident when you went to talk to Shang-shishu, did you find anything?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Perhaps I have a clue. But it is very imprecise and this Master needs to investigate first."</span>
</p><p>
<span>When he takes a step forward, heading for the Rainbow Bridge, the other two follow coordinated.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Aren't you going to leave me alone?" Luo Binghe hisses when they reach Qing Jing Peak.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge responds with a snort.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"And allow you to kidnap Shen Yuan as well if I left you alone? In your dreams."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan walks a few steps ahead, even so, he hears them perfectly. It would be easy to ignore their discussion and attribute it to rivalry stupidity, but Shang Qinghua has managed to make him no longer consider their anger the same.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Luo Binghe..." Shen Yuan stops. And at that moment he understands that he is still afraid. For the others, it has been years, for him only a long dream since the last time he saw his disciple. Fear has conditioned all of his decisions about Luo Binghe, such as accepting his blood or self-destruction. And they are not, precisely, small gestures. Shen Yuan gulps before looking at that stranger with the face of his disciple. "We need your help. Without you, I can never get Jiu-ge back."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This disciple will do whatever it takes!" He exclaims and his voice sounds desperate and broken.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But it is not enough for him to regret it if he later makes the same mistakes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"But when you return, we need you to get rid of that sword, please."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe frowns and looks doubtful for the first time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I need Xin Mo to protect shizun..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge snorts beside him, folding his arms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Since you have that sword you have done nothing to protect him."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan clears his throat to get their attention.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Xin Mo is dangerous. It hurts you and those around you, you need a better sword. And..." He swallows hard. "When we get Jiu-ge back, you'll have to listen to him. Understood? You can't decide for him. Nor kidnap him again."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Nor Shen Yuan," Liu Qingge adds, staring at the demon.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe clenches his fists tightly, ducking his head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I never intended for shizun to suffer." His gaze seeks Shen Yuan's with tears in his eyes. "Not even that shizun died. I'm sorry, shizun..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"But sometimes we make selfish decisions that hurt someone else," Shen Yuan mutters, thinking how badly Shang Qinghua must have felt when reading his comments. "Next time, think about the other person's feelings. Even if I hadn't, ahem, </span>
<em>
<span>disappeared</span>
</em>
<span>." He clears his throat nervously. "I wouldn't have been happy if you had abducted me that other time. I want to be here. With my disciples, my books, my cat, and Jiu-ge. And the same goes for my brother. You can't decide for us."</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I understand.” Luo Binghe mutters, still with his head bowed, but dropping his fists weakly. "I'll fix everything."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"There is a third thing this Master must ask of you when we rescue Jiu-ge." Shen Yuan takes a deep sigh. "Go see Mu Qingfang."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe finally reacts, tensing up defensively.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I'm fine."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No, you're not. We threw you into the Abyss. That was cruel and horrible. It's normal if you're not okay." His gaze searches for Liu Qingge, who listens silently to them still frowning and arms crossed. "You too, Liu-shidi. You have suffered because of me, this Master apologizes."</span>
</p><p>
<span>They are no longer characters, but people. And people suffer when someone they love dies or are pushed unexplained to hell.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Meanwhile, in another world, the Demon Emperor storms into Shen Jiu's room with violent rage.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>The morning of the same day that Luo Binghe storms into Shen Jiu's room with violent rage, Shen Jiu decides to visit the garden again. In an unexpected burst of courage, Ning Yingying decides to accompany him. Although she is not his true disciple, Shen Jiu has sympathy for her. And he also feels remorse to see her tremble and wring her hands uneasily. Ning Yingying walks beside him with little mouse steps, despite the fact that, according to the information he has gathered, she is one of Luo Bing-ge's three main wives.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, Shen Jiu understands her. The others seem to have been corrupted by the darkness of the Demon Lord. That whole world seems twisted and putrid, shattered in a nauseating way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This time, Shen Jiu has created an armor of arrogance to return to the garden. Despite the storm of sharp stares, cruel laughter, and tension that poisons the air, Shen Jiu walks as if this place belongs to him. Those ignorant fools think they can affect him, but they don't know that this situation is better than the helplessness of being a slave of the Qiu.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Shen Jiu hasn't forgotten: now he's a cultivator, a Peak Lord with good reasons to return to his world. He not only possesses the power to defend himself but also the experience of being a prisoner and spiteful intelligence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Step one: don't resist. His enemies must underestimate him, belief in their victory to soften their vigilance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Second step: gather more information about the artifacts that Luo Bing-ge used to kidnap him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu walks with apparent disinterest, telling Ning Yingying about the plants and flowers that decorate the garden. She responds with forced smiles and monosyllables. Despite her discomfort, he doesn't stop. Nor when nervousness grows like branches under his skin. There are sharper gazes than others, crueler voices, and Shen Jiu seeks them out despite the trembling of his heart. He still remembers the claustrophobia and dank darkness of the cell in which the thing is locked like a vomiting nightmare. And the culprits of that confinement are close. Too much.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Right now, they are worse than Luo Bing-ge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu is aware of Sha Hualing's closeness when he decides to stop in front of a thicket of golden roses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Although these only grow in the Demon Realm, their origin is heavenly," he explains to Ning Yingying.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ignoring the people he despises is one of his best honed talents by time. Despite the demoness' shrill appearance, Shen Jiu pretends that she doesn’t exist in a performance worthy of recognition. That annoys her, of course. Sha Hualing walks towards them accompanied by the jingle of her bells. Although Ning Yingying stiffens, he continues to turn his back on her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What a surprise to see you around, Master Shen!" The demoness greets him with a sweet but cold laugh. "I hope you are not trying to escape."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu assumes that such a large harem must be supported by a complicated system of privileges. Fortunately, all of his targets are central figures. He turns to give her one of his most dismissive glances. From what he has deduced, Sha Hualing is not only one of the main wives, but also a close companion of Luo Binghe. Everything he says or does will be reported to the demon. Probably twisted to turn the truth into a lie.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Perfect,</span>
</em>
<span> he thinks, curling his lips into a grimace.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Unlike you, I’m not stupid."</span>
</p><p>
<span>The demoness's smile grows to show his fangs. A menacing reddish gleam flashes in her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Perhaps Master Shen doesn't understand the situation..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I think you are the one who doesn’t understand. Let this Master enlighten you." Shen Jiu sketches one of those grimaces that he hasn’t used for years, formed with half-mockery and half-disdain. "This is not my world. I have nowhere to go, why waste my precious time trying? I’m unarmed and I sense that the world outside the palace is hostile. Do you want to push me into danger, demoness?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>He has spoken loud enough that the whole harem can hear them. Humiliating Sha Hualing may be one of the few hobbies of some of these women. Despite the accusation, the demoness is a worthy opponent and doesn’t allow rage to engulf the control of her emotions.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"So, have you accepted your fate to marry Jushang? How unexpected of the proud Master Shen! Too bad that no one is happy to include you in the family."</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>As I care.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>"Who said anything about getting married?" That gets the demoness to smile victoriously by catching a hint of rebellion. "Your husband is clearly confused. I intend to wait for him to get bored and return me to my world."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"That will not happen, Master Shen. Luo Binghe has a record of more than three hundred successful conquests and no failures."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Of course, that plan is too naive and even Shen Jiu doesn't believe in it. </span>
<em>
<span>Too bad, </span>
</em>
<span>he sighs.</span>
<em>
<span> It would be the perfect answer.</span>
</em>
<span> Still, he waves his hand to downplay his words. Looking stupid is part of the first step of his plan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I know my disciple better than you, but thank you for your consideration."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sha Hualing takes a deep breath, slightly annoyed by his indifferent attitude to her provocations.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I'm afraid Master Shen is terribly wrong... about everything."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"And what makes you suppose that someone like you knows more than the Qing Jing Peak Lord?" Shen Jiu raises an eyebrow. "As I understand it, I am the only one who has met two Luo Binghe and two worlds. What about you?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>A slight but furious blush covers the demoness's cheeks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I’m trying to give you some friendly advice, Master Shen. You are underestimating my Jushang's tenacity."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"And you my ambition." Shen Jiu takes a deep breath before grinning like a villain. Third step: encourage Luo Binghe's wives to get rid of him. "As I've already said, I know two Luo Binghe, why would I resign myself to staying here? </span>
<em>
<span>My </span>
</em>
<span>Luo Binghe," he possessively emphasizes the name to sound more believable. "has promised me fidelity. I have no interest in competing with you when I can have </span>
<em>
<span>one </span>
</em>
<span>Luo Binghe entirely to myself. Even more! Depending on what I wish, I can choose between a Demon Lord and a War God, both equally attractive and with immeasurable talent."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu is almost startled after hearing a furious hiss, but it's part of his role to be arrogant and unattainable. Ning Yingying hides behind him and Sha Hualing turns her head to see Liu Mingyan approaching them with furious and restless steps.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Perfect,</span>
</em>
<span> Shen Jiu lifts his sleeve to cover his smile. </span>
<em>
<span>It is time to move on third and fourth steps.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Who!?” He growls. "Who dared to take the title from my brother?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu lets out an exaggeratedly mocking giggle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No one. Did Luo Binghe tell you anything? Liu Qingge is alive in my world."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Despite the veil, Liu Mingyan pales as she realizes what that means. Despite the fact that Sha Hualing is famous for her hot blood while she for her calmness, the woman draws her sword to point it at him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Stay away from my brother!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"How if he insists on meekly crawling into my bed?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu longs for a fan. It's hard to control his emotions and hide the satisfaction that the third and fourth steps of his plan work perfectly. Poor naive girls, facing the master of collecting enemies. Although the fourth step involves them discovering how different the two worlds are, the third requires them to see him as a love rival and they preferentially conspire to give him back to his world. At worst, they will try to assassinate him, but that's the sixth step.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Mingyan shivers vividly and her rage makes her sword tremble.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh, don't look at me like that. Your brother is a formidable warrior, an unsurpassed beauty and this master is unable to resist his charms."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You're lying! You hate him!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"How could I hate the man who saved my life?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Mingyan blinks, confused. The best lies are those that seem credible. Grudge blinds Liu Mingyan, but her brother's adoration will make her accept without hesitation all the compliments he says about Liu Qingge. Luckily, she will slowly begin to believe that he is in love with Liu Qingge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu sighs exaggeratedly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"In this world, there is no Liu Qingge and I must share Luo Binghe with three hundred despicable women, why should I stay? Unless..." He has turned and looks at them sideways. "I wonder how far Luo Binghe will go to get my affection. My tastes are simple: I appreciate loyalty and devotion above any jewel."</span>
</p><p>
<span>The satisfaction of contemplating their nervousness and restlessness almost made up for the unpleasant moment they made him suffer. </span>
<em>
<span>This is fun,</span>
</em>
<span> he thinks. </span>
<em>
<span>It's been a long time since I've bothered someone so much. </span>
</em>
<span>Shen Jiu hums as he wonders how Luo Bing-ge will act if he posed such a dilemma to him. Too bad that everything he has told is lies and he has no intention of staying in that world and ruling over a harem.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But they don't know. They don’t know that Shen Jiu's true motivation is to return to his brother’s side or that his romantic feelings are much more confused. They don't know anything, they just believe in misconceptions.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A servant appears and the four of them turn in unison.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Master Shen, Lord Luo sent this humble one to announce that he will eat with you today."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu exaggerates a victorious smile to rub that preference over the other two even though his heart beats uneasily.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fifth step: Avoid Luo Binghe, but subtly. He must avoid both his anger and interest. He must be so boring as a doll, someone who doesn’t involve any risk; someone that offers him a pinch of what he wants to prevent him from forcing him against his will.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It will be a pleasure."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That day, the Demon Emperor storms into Shen Jiu's room with violent rage.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu groans, annoyed by the sudden scandal, but without opening his eyes. He notices how the healers and servants surrounding his bed are startled and receive his lord with fearful curtsies.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"How is he? Who did it?" His anger reverberates against the walls and makes the furniture shack. "Who dares to poison my future wife?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>It's hard trying to stay hurt while his own anger grows inside the walls of his stomach. Oh, Shen Jiu hates that possessiveness, that feminization that he has never asked for. However, he still has the satisfaction of being more intelligent and that is why he doesn’t react when Luo Bing-ge sits on the edge of the mattress to take one of his hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We think it could have been one of his wives... again," comments one of the healers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Rumors say..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"... that Sha-fei wants to get rid of Master Shen..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"... or that Master Shen provoked Sha-fei and Liu-dafei..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"... or that several of them are jealous..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Fortunately, it is a mild poison! Master Shen will recover with a little rest!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Of course, it is a mild poison. Shen Jiu is not that desperate to poison himself with an unknown poison that could cause him irreparable harm. Even so, he groans again, keeping his eyes closed in the determination that Luo Binghe will decide to let him rest and forget about the promised meal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He is not rejecting him, too bad that he has been poisoned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Too bad that some idiot planted beautiful but poisonous flowers in a garden.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Too bad that he possesses an encyclopedic knowledge of flora.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu struggles to remain unconscious when Luo Binghe stands up. And that victory is more satisfying than having left his rivals speechless. The demon takes too long to let go of his hand, but in the end, he does so while muttering a frustrated growl.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Find out the culprit. I don't care who it was, this will not end without punishment."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yes, my lord!!!!" Several voices chant.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A treacherous smile almost peeks across his lips as the bedroom door closes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sixth step: weaken Luo Bing-ge's trust in his harem.</span>

<p>
<span>Shen Yuan becomes aware of the weariness on his eyelids as Luo Binghe kneels beside him to offer him a cup of tea.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shizun..." His disciple's voice is a murmur fearful of making a mistake. If Shen Yuan wasn't so focused on reading ancient manuscripts, he would have noticed that Luo Binghe walks silently, his expression clouded, and his shoulders slumped as if were crushed by an invisible weight. "It's late. Shizun should rest."</span>
</p><p>
<span>His exhaustion is as thick as the darkness that covers the sky, but Shen Yuan stretches like a cat before shaking his head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This master is fine."</span>
</p><p>
<span>But when he goes to resume reading the manuscript, someone takes it from him. Shen Yuan protests with a groan, but Liu Qingge ignores him. With a determined scowl, he jerked and carelessly scooped up all the reading material Shen Yuan had gathered. Shen Yuan trembles as he gazes at those battered books.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Rest." Liu Qingge orders him with a growl, unexpectedly soft and with a hint of concern.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This master is fine!" Shen Yuan protests.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But neither of them wants to believe him. With a resigned sigh, Shen Yuan reluctantly agrees that he won’t be able to continue investigating that night. Unless he gets rid of his guests. So, he stretches his arms while he exaggerates a yawn.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Okay, it's late. But you should rest too." He adds.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After all, both Liu Qingge and Luo Binghe have been helping him while he consulted different books. Both have flown from one end of the sect to the other to bring him material from the libraries of the other peaks and have assisted him in all his requests. If it weren't for them, Shen Yuan wouldn't have even eaten!</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan rests one elbow on the table and his chin on the back of his hand as he watches over his former disciple.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This master wonders… Luo Binghe." He is startled after hearing his name. "Where are you staying?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Both men stiffen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Nowhere shizun." Luo Binghe's answer is cautious. "This disciple returns to his palace."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"But it's too late!" Shen Yuan misses a glance at the sky outside the window, dark as coal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It's fine, shizun. With Xin Mo, I can shorten any distance..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No!" He screams helplessly. "We said you would never use Xin Mo again! That sword is dangerous, save it for unavoidable situations and never use it again for trifles, understand?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe lowers his head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yes, shizun."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Despite all his fears after hearing Shang Qinghua's reprimand, Luo Binghe is acting with the same docility of a dog that has made a mistake. That relieves Shen Yuan. The Luo Binghe in the book would never give up his golden finger, but this Luo Binghe can still become someone else different.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan sighs as he massages the bridge of his nose.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You must be tired and this master won’t allow you to travel at night. You should stay overnight here..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What!?" Liu Qingge sputters, his eyes widened. "Don't even think about it, Shen Yuan!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Why not?" He turns to him, gazing at him with innocence. "He is a disciple of Qing Jing Peak after all..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"He is dangerous."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe growls at him, showing his teeth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I would never hurt shizun."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"As if no one could believe you anymore!" Liu Qingge waves his arm, clenching his fist tightly. "Have you already forgotten everything you've done?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This disciple already apologized..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You can't apologize to Shen Jiu because he's missing. Because of you!" Liu Qingge takes a deep breath as he closes his eyes. "Don't dream of being alone with either of them until you show me that you've really changed."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan sits up slowly so as not to startle either of them and walks towards Liu Qingge with tiny steps. By placing a hand on his forearm, Shen Yuan appreciates Liu Qingge's tension. His frustration is evident in every brief outburst of rage. Shen Yuan wishes he could help him, but as the days go by, he is becoming more aware of that emptiness that separates him from others.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It is not easy to recover from almost two years of nonexistence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You also need to rest, Liu-shidi." He whispers to him, sliding his hands over his arm to relax his muscles. However, that strains him even more. Liu Qingge turns his head so sharply that he must have hurt his neck. "Are you okay?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yeah..." He manages to sputter, ears red, before releasing his arm from him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ahead of them, Luo Binghe has narrowed his eyes and is suspiciously watching them. Although he now understands their reasons better, Shen Yuan is tired of the war between them. Every gesture, every word, even the most innocent context, sparks between the two.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Well, this master trusts his disciple. Luo Binghe won't let me down, right?" He says, looking Luo Binghe into the eyes, who immediately nods.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His words hide emotional blackmail, but Shen Yuan won't regret it if his dirty tricks work. However, despite Luo Binghe's promise, Liu Qingge hisses in anger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What do I do then? Let him sleep in a hut!?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan considers that to be outrageous, however, Liu Qingge shakes his head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Too close. He is coming with me to Bai Zhan Peak."</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan puts a hand to his chin as he evaluates the proposal. Luo Binghe, on the other hand, opens his eyes in horror.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Not a bad idea, Liu-shidi."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shizun!" The demon whimpers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"But you must promise me that you will treat Luo Binghe as a guest. Can I trust you, Liu-shidi?" More emotional blackmail. But since it's working, he decides to take advantage of that opportunity to improve their relationship a bit. "Listen to me you two: this Master is tired of your fights. Arguing won’t help us to rescue Jiu-ge but our union. I hope you can rest tonight, but if this Master hears that you have fought again or that someone has offended his host or the host hasn't taken care of his guest..." He pauses dramatically before giving them an icy look despite his smile. "You will disappoint me a lot, is it clear?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although they both bow their heads, the tension between them hasn’t disappeared. But Shen Yuan is content that neither kills the other overnight. And he can investigate without a headache after listening to them argue for hours about who makes his food.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It's no surprise that once he closes the door to his house, he hears them growling outside, but that's no longer his problem. Nope. If they keep arguing, Shen Yuan will punish them, but that will be tomorrow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now that he is no longer distracted, Shen Yuan can continue investigating. After retrieving his books, he lights a new candle determined to read through the entire night until he finds a way to retrieve his brother.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>The only reason Liu Qingge allows that ungrateful beast Luo Binghe into his house is because of Shen Yuan. Even though he hates breathing the same air as him, at least he will be calmer if he can keep an eye on him instead of the prospect of the beast sleeping under the same roof as Shen Yuan, who still does not understand the intentions of his disciple.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Despite his sour mood, Luo Binghe lets out a mocking snort once they reach Bai Zhan Peak.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I don't want to offend Liu-shishu, but I don't think anyone can live here."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge shoots a glare at the demon.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We don't all need a fancy palace."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Do you know that furniture exists, Liu-shishu? And that dust is removed, not treasured?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge hopes that Shen Yuan will forgive him if he </span>
<em>
<span>mistakenly </span>
</em>
<span>buries Luo Binghe inside a deep well.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Be a good guest and shut up." He growls as he walks through the house.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I don't know if Liu-shishu could be a good host, do you have any food? The kitchen seems... empty."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You can practice inedia, spoiled demon."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I was a better host," Luo Binghe mutters under his breath before raising his voice again. “At least you have two beds, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“...”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Liu-shishu?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“...”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Liu-shishu!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>To prevent Luo Bing-ge from being suspicious of his plans, Shen Jiu cannot always run away from him or hide behind excuses. And, very reluctantly, there are times when he agrees to his presence. Shen Jiu feels that he is walking through an abyss where he must estimate every gesture, tone of voice, and words. To the harem, he must be a threat. To Luo Bing-ge, someone boring who poses no threat. It's an uncomfortable contradiction that keeps him tense every day. Shen Jiu must calm his hatred, his poisonous rage, the fear that he doesn’t want to acknowledge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu is discovering that his emotions are very intense and his control over them is dire.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although it shouldn’t be a surprise to him since his failure to handle Shen Yuan's disappearance or to push Luo Binghe into the Endless Abyss in a panic blinded by betrayal. Still, it's frustrating.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That morning, Shen Jiu walks by the side of his enemy making an effort so that his gaze doesn’t linger on Xin Mo. He won’t make the mistake of underestimating Luo Bing-ge again. And an inadvertent gesture is enough to sink all his efforts. After all, they are both aware that he is not there of his own free will and will take any opportunity to flee.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu couldn't look at Xin Mo while he thought about stealing the dark sword. It is the most tempting, complicated, and stupid plan. Without erasing the wall that separates the two dimensions, Xin Mo will be useless in his hands. Furthermore, Shen Jiu understands the danger of the sword and he will prefer not to touch it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That’s why he has a second plan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Due to his statements, whenever he has no choice but to accompany Luo Bing-ge, one of his wives will go with them. Luck smiles on him that day when Liu Mingyan joins them on a walk through the forest near the palace.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman watches him with shadowed eyes, and Shen Jiu wonders if the marriage has already argued about Liu Qingge. For the moment, the only change is that her tension is more suspicious than hateful. Although her anger still marks her gaze, turning her into a different person than the Liu Mingyan he knows.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Too bad that the Demon Lord insists on monopolizing his attention and preventing him from talking to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu takes advantage of a moment in which they stop to dodge Luo Bing-ge with the excuse of talking to her and pretending to not have noticed that the demon was trying to put his arm around his waist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Are you okay? You are very quiet, Liu Mingyan."</span>
</p><p>
<span>She squints her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I'm fine."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her response is abrupt and curt. Perhaps Liu Mingyan has accepted that he didn’t kill her brother in another world, but that will not erase her animosity towards him. Shen Jiu covers his face with his fan as he values his next move.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The second plan is complicated.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"In my world, you talk a lot. When you are quiet, is it because something worries you. Does something worry you, Liu Mingyan?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You know exactly what it is." She walks past him, hitting him with her elbow, to stand next to Luo Bing-ge. "Why did you bring him? He is still the hateful Shen Qingqiu."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"He is different," Luo Binghe insists.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Both speak with the fatigue of having repeated that discussion many times in the shadows of their relationship. Shen Jiu looks at them straining to maintain a neutral expression. It doesn't benefit him if either of them discovers the snake lurking behind his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"He is not! Perhaps my brother had more luck in another world, but he is still a coward, a traitor, and a murderer. He will hurt you again, my husband."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I don’t think so." Luo Bing-ge responds with the arrogance of someone who thinks he is invincible. But when he turns his head to look at him, again with that unfulfilled hunger of a spoiled demon, Shen Jiu trembles. "He loves my counterpart."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Sorry?" Shen Jiu nearly chokes on sputtering. "I told you to forget those horrible books..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It wasn't the books, shizun. It was what you said, your concern..." Luo Bing-ge walks towards him and Shen Jiu forgets his self-control and backs away until his back hits a tree. The demon is in front of him and it is one of those times when he is immense, a shadow that completely covers him. "You tried to protect him even if you're weaker. You care about him."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Care is not the same as love." He frowns.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh, shizun. I knew your hatred better than anyone." A claw-like hand caresses his cheek, making him shiver. "You never cared like this for anyone, not even Ying'er, not even the poor sect leader Yue. I know this because I know you better than anyone."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu has held his breath and only takes a deep breath when Luo Binghe pulls away. His cheek tickles in an echo of that brief but terrifying touch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"For me, they are the same." Liu Mingyan grumbles.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Shen Jiu decides to desperately seize on that opportunity.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We’re not. If you have so many doubts, go ahead and ask me anything about your brother. And I'll show you that Liu Qingge and I were close."</span>
</p><p>
<span>This time he doesn't dare to say </span>
<em>
<span>intimate </span>
</em>
<span>so as not to risk invoking Luo Bing-ge's jealousy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Mingyan stares at him and says nothing for a few seconds until she nods.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Fine. How did you two meet?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Cang Qiong Sect’s Annual Twelve Peak Martial Arts Meeting. Your brother won."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Obviously. And you lost and screamed that one day you would kill him."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Perhaps." He shrugs without assuming another embarrassing moment in his life where he lost control of his anger. "But then something happened. We were sent on a mission together and Liu Qingge saved my life. I couldn't bear to owe him that debt, so... I invited him to lunch." He improvises. Desperate for his lack of imagination at a stressful moment, Shen Jiu decides to draw inspiration from some scenes from the infamous Resentment of Chunshan books. "I brought him a basket of loquats without knowing that this was his favorite fruit."</span>
</p><p>
<span>To his surprise, Liu Mingyan closes her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It was..." She murmurs wistfully.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh, what a lucky coincidence!</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>"We started to get along better as a result of that incident. Your brother is an excellent warrior, but a disaster of a person. Whenever he goes on an expedition he forgets something..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It’s true." Liu Mingyan sobs. "I remember the time I had to go after him because he had forgotten the family seal."</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Another coincidence? Today is my lucky day.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>"So, I was left with no choice but to help him pack his luggage. I think that's how we became friends. Your brother is stupid, simple, and trustworthy. I'm so glad to meet him," he adds and a sincere smile escapes from his heart. Shen Jiu immediately hides it behind the fan. "Once, during one of our trips, we rested at the Liu state. In the end, we stayed two days longer than expected because his entire family challenged me to a duel."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh, the family tradition! They did the same with my husband."</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>More coincidences!!!!????</span>
</em>
<span> He frowns, uneasy that whoever wrote the Resentment of Chunshan books knows Liu Qingge too well. Well, he will worry about the identity of that infamous writer when he returns to his world.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With calculated steps, Shen Jiu approaches Liu Mingyan and puts a hand on her shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"In my world, I also have a brother. He... died. I know your pain. I know your anger. If I could, I too would do anything to get him back." He softens his voice as he allows sincere tears to flood his eyes. "You are not alone, Liu Mingyan."</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Shen Jiu waits, heart crushed against his ribs, for them to fall into his trap. The only one who knows how to cross both dimensions is Luo Bing-ge. The only one who can manipulate Xin Mo is Luo Bing-ge. Oh, Shen Jiu is not an idiot. He won’t risk angering the volatile Demon Lord by stealing his sword since he won’t know what to do with it later.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His plan is more perverse and complicated, more subtle because it is about apparently doing nothing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His plan is to tempt Luo Bing-ge to open the way between the two dimensions again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Liu Qingge is the perfect bait.</span>

<p>Of course, his plan is not perfect and Shen Jiu is aware of its worst weakness: Luo Bing-ge will keep his decision to open the way to the other world in secret. Probably, the only one who will know is Liu Mingyan and that is why Shen Jiu tries to coincide with her to contemplate any change in her attitude. And, at the same time, he shouldn’t arouse any suspicion because it is precisely Liu Mingyan who is most suspicious of him. While Luo Bing-ge's other wives consider him a threat to their stability in the harem, Liu Mingyan sees him as a cruel and manipulative person. Perhaps his last words about Liu Qingge have softened that impression, but Shen Jiu is not naive enough to believe that she will suddenly consider him a good person.</p><p>Furthermore, staying entertained with pointless activities helps him flee from Luo Bing-ge as he continues to build his caged animal facade. Although that has its downsides, like enduring the presence of despicable creatures like Sha Hualing.</p><p>That morning the demoness sits in front of him under the gazebo in the garden. Her smile is fake, bright, and sharp, and Shen Jiu watches her suspiciously. Perhaps Sha Hualing prevented him from being physically harmed the first day, but she was the one who mocked him most cruelly. Seeing her, Shen Jiu trembles as he remembers the suffocating confinement in the cell with the <em> thing </em>.</p><p>Before returning to his world, he will destroy the <em> thing </em>. That’s a promise.</p><p>"Good morning, Master Shen... Or should I call you concubine Shen already? I understand that my husband will soon announce your new title."</p><p>With her, Shen Jiu doesn't bother to pretend innocence, instead, he gives her a disgusted look.</p><p>"What do you want?" Shen Jiu rests his chin on the back of his hand. "I know you, vermin. You don't need to pretend with me."</p><p>“Pretend? Oh, don't get me wrong, Master Shen. I find it extremely amusing that my husband has decided to make you his new bed toy. However..." She leans toward him, her smile showing her fangs. "You are acting very calm, Master Shen. That is unlike you. And I know you very well. You are arrogant and proud, you would never allow a demon to make you his vulgar concubine. That makes me think of two possibilities: you aspire to something more, perhaps to be his empress, something that I will prevent. Or that you are intentionally keeping a low profile to escape your destiny the moment we lower our guard. Something that I will also prevent because, honestly, this fate is funnier than the one that the previous Shen Qingqiu suffered." Sha Hualing closes her eyes flirtatiously as her voice becomes softer and more melodious. "So? Which of the two games are you playing? And don't waste your time trying to fool me. You've even allowed yourself to be poisoned even though you possess the power to protect yourself from stupid tricks."</p><p>Well, that's part of his plan. And not all the attacks have been caused by himself, but Shen Jiu has intentionally lowered his guard to instigate the other members of the harem to attack him. Punishing his mistresses, wives, and concubines have also kept Luo Bing-ge distracted. <em> Although if what she says is true, I'm running out of time. </em></p><p>Shen Jiu opens his fan.</p><p>"I think you're wrong, but that doesn’t surprise me. Although for the first time in your life, you have hit one prediction: yes, I’ve a plan." He snorts before smirking. "I think I already warned you, demoness, but I have the knowledge of both worlds. And some people don’t change. Do you think I want to stay in a palace where they will try to attempt my life? Obviously not."</p><p>"So, you are interested in the first game: winning your place next to Luo Binghe."</p><p>"Why do you look surprised? But don’t make a mistake, I don't plan on destroying the entire harem. Ning Yingying was my disciple and I appreciate her. I also don't mind Luo Binghe getting distracted by various women because honestly, I'm not attracted to the idea of satiating his appetite alone. However... this harem needs a purge."</p><p>Sha Hualing has crossed her arms and although she is still smiling, her posture is threatening. Perhaps Luo Bing-ge gave her the order to protect him from the other’s intrigues, but the demoness is the most dangerous and ruthless of them. And right now she's evaluating whether he's a menace to get rid of.</p><p>Accepting her enmity is as foolish as agreeing to become Luo Bing-ge's concubine, and Shen Jiu will not take that risk.</p><p>"Am I pretending weakness? Indeed." He keeps talking. "Because the most annoying person must disappear. So far, I know that she is instigating women with a lower status so that she doesn’t stain her hands. And that is what I want: to provoke her into making a mistake. After all, she already did something similar in my world and I am using that information to my advantage."</p><p>"And you're telling me because...?"</p><p>"I don't like you and you don't like me either, but we can ally against a common enemy. I'm pretty sure you don't enjoy such a huge harem either. Small numbers are easier to handle."</p><p>"Interesting. I hear you." However, her expression hides her thoughts behind an empty smile.</p><p>"In my world, when my Luo Binghe showed interest in courting me, the Little Palace Mistress tried to end my life. That mistake ended with her banishment." Shen Jiu smiles behind the fan. "Do you want to help me, demoness? Maybe if you pretend to help her, she will rush in and I can get rid of that nuisance."</p><p>And he finally succeeds: Sha Hualing's eyes sparkle with mischief.</p><p>"How, Master Shen?"</p><p>"In my world, she used a certain poison. Ancient Stone Bat’s." He explains in a whisper. "It is lethal, but fortunately the antidote is in this garden."</p><p>As he speaks, Shen Jiu caresses a tiny but beautiful purple flower growing near the gazebo.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Luo Bing-ge has doubts about the War God.</p><p>Meeting him in the other world was as unexpected as discovering a softer and funnier version of his shizun. However, that man is as madly in love with Shen Qingqiu as his other self is. And that is a competition that he doesn’t need. Furthermore, he never faced Liu Qingge and is unaware of the extent of his true power.</p><p>According to Liu Mingyan, his brother was one of the most powerful cultivators. Perhaps she is exaggerating. Maybe not. Luo Bing-ge decided to set a trap for Yue Qingyuan precisely because he didn’t underestimate his talent.</p><p>However... It's been a long time since he had a worthy match. And he lost the opportunity in the other world to face Liu Qingge.</p><p>Luo Bing-ge invokes the dagger with which he sealed the two realities while he wonders what to do. Liu Mingyan won't rest now that she knows his brother lives in another world, but he doesn't need more suitors to distract his shizun.</p><p><em> I can face him </em> . Luo Bing-ge thinks while the adrenaline rush before a battle burns in his veins. <em> If he is too powerful, I must prevent him from entering this world. But if I beat him, I can give him to Yan'er. Also, I will have the guarantee that I can control him if he tries to get close to shizun. </em></p><p>The Demon Lord smirks.</p><p> </p><p>The eternal quarrels between Liu Qingge and Luo Binghe distract Shen Yuan, who no longer knows how to punish them. At least they don't try to kill each other anymore, but they keep arguing over any trifle and it's horrible. As if they were little children, Shen Yuan has had to separate them with different tasks while he continues to investigate. And so, Luo Binghe is sitting in a corner examining Xin Mo as Liu Qingge prepares to return to Mu Qingfang the books he lent and Shen Yuan has already read.</p><p>The silence is broken when Luo Binghe hisses through his teeth. Immediately, the two of them turn to him.</p><p>"Now what?" Liu Qingge growls, frowning.</p><p>"I feel something ..." Despite his expression of concentration, Luo Binghe's eyes spark with a hope that makes Shen Yuan's heart stop. "The other world. I can feel it."</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The dagger gleams in his hand as do his eyes, intense scarlet like freshly shed blood. <em> Let's see, shishu, if you deserve the title of War God... </em></p><p>"My Lord," murmurs a trembling voice behind him.</p><p>Luo Bing-ge growls as he stops the process. He turns angrily and the servant flinches even more.</p><p>"What do you want?" He hisses.</p><p>If it’s something stupid, he'll kill him. And the servant understands by reading that murderous desire in his eyes, for his voice becomes even shakier.</p><p>"It's Master Shen! Someone has poisoned Master Shen!"</p><p>Luo Bing-ge squints as his dark qi grows around him.</p><p>Today someone will die.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Luo Binghe's illusion fades and Shen Yuan knows without words that he has lost that link to the other world. Despite the painful disappointment, he places a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>"It's fine, Luo Binghe." He sighs. "We will be luckier next time. When you feel the protection weakening again, we will try to get through it. We need to be vigilant, as it could happen at any moment."</p><p>Liu Qingge puts his hand to Cheng Luan's hilt, Luo Binghe clenches his fists. And both agree with the same determination.</p>

<p>
<span>For the first time since Shen Yuan woke up underground, he feels determination fluctuating in his veins. It is a warm feeling that restores hope and erases the psychological wear caused by tension, by the fear of having lost his brother perhaps forever and not knowing how to get him back. Now, they have a possible solution which implies that they must be together while they wait for the next time Luo Binghe detects an anomaly in the wall that separates both worlds. Perhaps it is a natural fluctuation, perhaps it is a weak point, or even Shen Jiu's efforts to escape.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They, on the other hand, have another opinion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I'll be with... </span>
<em>
<span>him</span>
</em>
<span>." Liu Qingge hisses as he gazes at Luo Binghe with the same contempt the demon gives him. "But you must stay here."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan blinks. It is hard for him to believe that he has heard correctly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No way! And abandon my brother? Never!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Liu-shishu is right." It is as strange as creepy that they have agreed on something. "It is dangerous, shizun must stay in Qing Jing Peak."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I'm not defenseless!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"The other... me could manipulate the other shizun because of our blood..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This body doesn't even have your blood, Luo Binghe!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Honestly, facing the original protagonist terrifies Shen Yuan. He is a shadow that Shen Yuan has feared since he appeared in this world. But circumstances have changed. Liu Qingge and Luo Binghe are his allies and he WANTS to travel to the other world to help Shen Jiu. Of all of them, he is the one who knows the PIDW intrigues best. They need him to survive!</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan clears his throat, determined to not give up on the firm resolve of the other two.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This Master is no ballast. From your description, the Luo Binghe from the other world is acting like... Taxian-jun." He responds with the character’s name from another novel that he never read but had been recommended to him. "Do you know him? He is a famous Emperor Lord. Thanks to the historical documents I’ve studied, this Master is able to predict what kind of world we will encounter. You need me."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan's stubbornness, which made him survive while reading PIDW to the end, is more powerful than the protagonist's halo. And in the end, he wins and the other two reluctantly agree to let him accompany them on the condition that whatever happens, he won’t separate from them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That means he now has two stressed guests at his house. Not a big deal. Luo Binghe freaks out cleaning the house and Liu Qinggge mistreats the food (inexplicably, despite cutting the meat with the sword and cooking with blows, the result is quite delicious). Shen Yuan is entertained by observing them as he collects all his knowledge from the original book. Every detail, every irrelevant subplot, will be crucial to the rescue mission.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A shichen later, the house is more orderly than ever and the two of them have prepared an ideal feast for twenty people. Shen Yuan isn't complaining. He deals with stress by eating while he talks nonsense so that others don't find out that he is actually thinking about torture and amputations and...</span>
</p><p>
<span>"That's so good!" Meanwhile, he may enjoy eating in the hope that the food will fill that void within his body. "You are both an ideal material for a husband. This master will regret a lot when you marry a woman and leave me alone... Jiu-ge doesn't know how to cook."</span>
</p><p>
<span>His words, innocent and sincere, have the power of an earthquake. Liu Qingge chokes, Luo Binghe's expression becomes indecipherable, a kaleidoscope of happiness and sadness culminating in him muttering: "I remember..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Since they're almost at a sleepover, this may be the ideal time to ask them about their romantic interests. Luo Binghe is already an adult and the romantic plot will begin soon, right? This is a harem novel, why are the two leads fighting over the villain? Shen Yuan clicks his tongue angrily. His brother wouldn't be in such trouble if demons had other priorities.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Thinking of Shen Jiu, of all that he will be suffering in the other world, his stomach twists. Anxiety devours hunger and a lump in his throat prevents him from swallowing. He can't smile anymore and his need to gossip about their love life disappears.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shen Yuan?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shizun?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I'm fine! I'm fine!" He sighs, briefly closing his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He is not well, but it is ridiculous to say it when his brother is worse. So Shen Yan takes all of his feelings and locks them deep in his heart, with the nostalgia for his past life and the terror of dying.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And he forces himself to smile again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"So... Liu-shidi, Luo Binghe, do you plan to get married in the future?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge breaks his chopsticks as he clenches his fist, and Luo Binghe's eyes sparkle even though his attitude is tense, suspicious, and uncomfortable. </span>
<em>
<span>Oh, </span>
</em>
<span>Shen Yuan hums, amused</span>
<em>
<span>. That means there is someone!</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>"You are both undeniably attractive and talented." He starts and instantly nervousness shakes them both. Shen Yuan smirks as he covers his mouth with his sleeve. "Is there a maiden who has caught your attention?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No." Liu Qingge growls with a firmness capable of ruining any joke.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Shidi, don't be angry! It's a joke! I'm teasing you because the tension is killing me and I need to distract myself or I will throw up!</span>
</em>
<span> Shen Yuan looks at Luo Binghe, too transparent, so sincere. While Liu Qingge's stubbornness makes him doubt, with Luo Binghe it is clear: he is in love with someone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What about you, Luo Binghe?" He is startled to hear him and Shen Yuan's smile grows. "Oh, you can't fool this master. Tell me, does Luo Binghe have anyone in mind?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>His former disciple raises his head and gazes into his eyes with a determination capable of altering the entire world. </span>
<em>
<span>Oh god, is Ning Yingying, right? When they solve this plot, the protagonist will declare Ning Yingying and as their shizun I will have to give my opinion. Don't worry, Binghe! This master supports your relationship with Ning Yingying. You don't have to be so tense!</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>"That's right shizun. This disciple has... two people in mind."</span>
</p><p>
<span>That doesn’t surprise him. </span>
<em>
<span>Well in the book he had a harem with a disproportionately huge number. Two is an ideal number! </span>
</em>
<span>However, Liu Qingge grunts and leaves the remains of the chopsticks on the table. Now, the two of them are glaring at each other and... Oh no.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>OH NO.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>They are Liu Mingyan and Ning Yingying, right? When Shen Yuan saved Liu Qingge, he never imagined that it would affect the main romantic plot of the book.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"That's quite bold, demon."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Liu-shishu can't judge me, you're as bold as me."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Oh. OH. Shen Yuan is starting to forget the reason behind the anxiety as surprises spread out before him. </span>
<em>
<span>Of course! Someone as great as Liu Qingge is the second male lead material! PIDW has risen to a love triangle!</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>"This Master..." He begins, making an effort to hide his inner gremlin behind a neutral expression. "This master is aware that some people can love more than one person. Two is not a bad number, as long as they cherish both equally."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Of course, shizun!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"But remember, Luo Binghe, two is an affordable number, but after three the disputes begin. I hope you remember my words when you start your harem."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"SHEN YUAN! Don't encourage the demon to create a harem!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"That's quite demonic, Liu-shidi. We must respect other cultures."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yes, Liu-shishu." Luo Binghe is smirking and that reminds him more of a villain than a protagonist. "You should respect demon culture. Furthermore, the purest cultivators never marry."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"YOU!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan sighs, finally hiding his expression behind the fan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don't be like that, Luo Binghe." He scolds his former disciple. "There is nothing dishonorable about cultivators having a dao partner. Honestly, with all the ridiculous situations that end in papapa… I mean, sex, it's strange that there isn't a habit of having a partner."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"But Liu-shishu is so powerful that he doesn't need any cultivation partner." Luo Binghe adds maliciously.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge seems about to draw Cheng Luan and challenge him to a duel right here. And for the sake of the integrity of his household, Shen Yuan must avoid it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But at the same time, this is so funny. And Shen Yuan doesn't remember the last time he felt so calm, not thinking about any of the worries that lie in wait for him. That also makes him feel guilty. He shouldn't be laughing while Shen Jiu suffers.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>If it weren't for his long experience lying to the entire world about Shen Yuan's identity, perhaps Shen Jiu would be laughing right now. His plan has been perfect. He now must endure a stickier Luo Bing-ge than usual, but while he is the poor maiden that Luo Bing-ge must comfort the harem trembles. As cunning as a viper, Sha Hualing has brought before the Demon Emperor a terrible accusation against the Little Palace Mistress.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This is the first time since he was kidnapped that Luo Bing-ge has summoned the entire harem. The courtroom is huge, and yet there are so many women gathered together that the atmosphere is oppressive. The dome of the harem is next to Luo Bing-ge. Liu Mingyan, Ning Yingying, Qiu Haitang, Qin Wanyue and Qin Wanrong surround their husband, while he must suffer the humiliation of sitting on his lap. Shen Jiu hates acting like a doll, but he is theoretically poisoned so he swallows his disgust. The Qiu taught him to lie, to pretend to be complacent, and harmless. Once again, those tools help him survive.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kneeling in front of Luo Bing-ge are Sha Hualing and the Little Palace Mistress. And behind the latter, a handful of women who have dared to confess some of the attacks Shen Jiu has suffered. Not all, of course. The main schemer is quietly sitting on Luo Bing-ge while the demon embraces him possessively. </span>
<em>
<span>This is even better than I expected</span>
</em>
<span>, he thinks. Sha Hualing is a fearsome rival. She must have promised them something very juicy for them to dare to acknowledge her attacks. Even though all these women are shaking, none have done anything serious, only small sabotages such as tearing his clothes or sending anonymous threats.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Only one has made the mistake of trying to poison him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They have all made the mistake of believing that one of them poisoned him previously.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Luo Bing-ge's patience has burnt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This Lord believes that he was quite clear when he warned that any attempt against shizun would be punished."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"She is lying!!" The Little Palace Mistress hisses with bloodshot eyes, probably in humiliation. "I would never dare to attack your favorite!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh, but you threatened them to do it." Sha Hualing purrs. "Don't be afraid. Neither of you had a choice, right?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>One by one, the women the demoness has brought confess their antics and all accuse the Little Palace Mistress of manipulating them. Shen Jiu doesn't care if what they say is true or false since there is probably a hint of everything. And the Little Palace Mistress trembles furiously.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Bing-ge's grip on his waist grows stronger with the accusations. His anger is terrifying. Shen Jiu can feel it in his restless breath, in the fire that burns in his eyes. For the first time since he began playing scheming, Shen Jiu trembles as he ponders the possibility of being discovered by the demon.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Since Master Shen's arrival, Xiao Gongzhu has been pressuring the lesser concubines to attack him." Sha Hualing resumes. Her smile is beautiful and red like the blood that she would like to spill. "But the other day you crossed the line by poisoning Master Shen with the Ancient Stone Bat's poison. But you didn't stop there! You also burned part of the garden, preventing Jushang from getting an antidote in time."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nor is it their fault that they believe Shen Jiu is dying. When Luo Bing-ge broke into his room to threaten the healers, he spoke to him. Shen Jiu knows how to be persuasive. After contemplating him with his wives, he has discovered what he likes: submission, the fragility of a toy. Oh, Luo Bing-ge accepted that charade as it meant playing with Shen Jiu as if he is a doll that must be carried in his arms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Shen Jiu is not dying.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ancient Stone Bat is an annoying but harmless poison. He already suffered it once and was only affected for two days.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu stretches subtly. As the two rivals in the harem argue to show who is crueler but smart enough to not attack him, Shen Jiu whispers into Luo Bing-ge's ear, intentionally brushing his lobe with his lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Should I say something?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Bing-ge caresses his cheek. His thumb slides to a stop on his lower lip and Shen Jiu for a few seconds fears that he will try to kiss him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Go ahead, shizun."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu breathes a sigh of relief when he gets permission to sit up and leave Luo Bing-ge's presence. The atmosphere is less oppressive, although everyone is looking at him and some have frowned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I think you are making a mistake, misses. This master is well."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sha Hualing laughs with satisfaction.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"As I expected from Jushang, only he would be able to find the remedy despite your ploy..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh miss, don't take us for idiots." Shen Jiu takes out a fan and opens it dismissively, though not hiding his disdainful smile. "There was never an antidote. The Ancient Stone Bat's poison is irrelevant."</span>
</p><p>
<span>The demoness' smile freezes, but she is cunning and doesn’t betray herself. She keeps smiling when she gazes at the confused Little Palace Mistress.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"See? They caught you burning the flowers like a fool."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You both got caught, miss." Shen Jiu takes a couple of steps forward. "You were the only one who knew about the false antidote, Sha Hualing. But in your arrogance, you decided to set a trap for Xiao Gongzhu by taking advantage of my incomplete information."</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wouldn't surprise him that all the women who have ratted out the Little Palace Mistress were originally blackmailed by Sha Hualing and that the demoness has always been trying to attack him from the shadows. After all, he planted that trap to confirm her intentions. If Sha Hualing had merely instigated the poisoning, that would mean that she too wished to get rid of Little Palace Mistress. But by attempting to boycott the antidote she reveals that she hoped to eliminate him and blame Little Palace Mistress for his murder.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Nice move, </span>
</em>
<span>he thinks.</span>
<em>
<span> You are a predator among flowers.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>But in the end, he wins.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu stands in the center, gazing condescendingly at his two defeated rivals. Sha Hualing has been so ambitious that she has also given him the tools to eliminate the Little Palace Mistress. In a commendable performance, Shen Jiu doesn't react when Luo Bing-ge stands up to stand beside him and hugs his waist possessively. Not when he announces that Shen Jiu will enter the harem... as his first husband.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He has won this fight, but not the war. Shen Jiu is aware that he is running out of time or tricks to prolong the inevitable.</span>

<p>
<span>Although the storm has died down, dark clouds and icy air still cover Luo Bing-ge's palace. The demon had always been aware of the plots in his harem, but until that moment he had never given them much thought. However, he demanded that none of his spouses should get close to Shen Qingqiu. And after a chain of incidents, two of his main wives tried to attempt his life.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Both of them have been punished, especially Xiao Gongzhu. Sha Hualing is not only his second wife but also a powerful ally and one of his demon generals. Instead of love, they are united by a passion for violence. However, the demoness crossed the line and he has revoked some of her privileges.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After the last trial, the situation in the harem seems to have calmed down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although Luo Bing-ge doesn’t trust his wives, he hopes that they won’t repeat the mistake of toying with his patience. The only games the demon allows are those in which he can participate or entertain him, but not those that damage his property. Of course, Luo Bing-ge doesn't trust Shen Qingqiu either. Although his submission pleases him, the demon recognizes a different game than he is used to. Perhaps that Shen Qingqiu's heart is different, but there’s still a layer of pride covering his skin. And Luo Bing-ge must use all his techniques and tricks to gently tear it apart.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fortunately, no matter how complicated his goal is, he always wins in the end.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The calm after the incident is allowing him to spend more time with his desired shizun. Although Shen Qingqiu always accepts his invitations, Luo Bing-ge is aware of the suspicion lurking in the depths of his eyes. His shizun is a wild and untamed beast. Although the demon has tied him to his side, it’s not enough. Luo Bing-ge yearns for more. With him, Shen Qingqiu always seems distant. It’s different from their past in Qing Jing Peak, colder and crueler, more like a breeze in his hands. Luo Bing-ge has savored the taste of a worried shizun and now he wants more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That morning, Shen Qingqiu had agreed to go on a boat ride with him. Luo Bing-ge had buried his past under luxury and extravagance, yet he had intentionally chosen the smaller boat, forcing Shen Qingqiu to stand beside him. They are so close that it is impossible for their bodies to not rub against each other, and yet Luo Bing-ge feels that distance between them. He may be hugging Shen Qingqiu right now, but his shizun is silent and aloof, more interested in looking at the scenery than giving him any attention. Perhaps his former Shen Qingqiu hated him, but at least he didn't ignore him as if he is irrelevant.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Every time Luo Bing-ge leans into him, devouring his personal space, he can see how Shen Qingqiu tenses up. His shizun is being polite, but out of fear or respect, he is trying to hide his true emotions.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Possessing Shen Qingqiu is not enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Bing-ge starts to play with his hair while Shen Qingqiu comments something about goldfish. His voice is as hollow as his expression. Luo Bing-ge could press him against the bottom of the ship and make him his right then and there, but then his shizun's cold facade would twist in rage. And Luo Bing-ge already tasted the hatred of one Shen Qingqiu. It was bitter and destructive, it left him scars that still burn years later. His hatred was more intense than the love of six hundred women and so Luo Bing-ge wonders what his affection will be like.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Will it be enough to complete that emptiness that he feels in his chest and that neither violence nor destruction can fill? Or will his interest vanish once he reaches his goal? After all, even the funniest games get tedious once he wins.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Bing-ge lets go of his hair to grab hold of his jaw, turning his face towards him. Fear shines in his dilated pupils, in the fists that crumple the sleeves, or the pressure of his lips tightening. The demon leans in intending to kiss him, but in the end, his lips stop at his cheek without daring to go any further. Thanks to that closeness, Luo Bing-ge appreciates his rapid heartbeat and ragged breathing. It’s not the excitement he's used to, but panic.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Relax, shizun." He whispers in his ear as he brushes his hair back from his face. "This Lord is patient."</span>
</p><p>
<span>But patience wears out as hunger grows. And they both know it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu takes a deep breath. Luo Bing-ge appreciates the effort he is making to get used to his presence. </span>
<em>
<span>So adorable</span>
</em>
<span>, he thinks before hugging him, so Shen Qingqiu ends up resting on his chest and he can amuse himself by playing with his hair. At times, his hand moves from the nape of his neck to slide down his spine, although without reaching his waist. Yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This Lord wonders... Will Shizun love me one day?" He chuckles, noticing his stiffness. "Shizun doesn't need to pretend anymore. I know you still don't love me."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu puts his hands on his shoulders and tries to move, but Luo Bing-ge prevents him from releasing. Resigned, Shen Qingqiu can only raise his head to meet his eyes. At least his shizun doesn't seem distant anymore and he regards him suspiciously.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Do I have another option?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No." Luo Bing-ge acknowledges before placing a kiss on his forehead.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Bing-ge has been a harem lord for many years. Few tricks will surprise him. And because of that, he suspects that Shen Qingqiu's passivity will be broken soon. It's a pretty obvious certainty: if displays of affection make Shen Qingqiu uncomfortable, he'll try to run away from his obligations after marriage. Something that Luo Bing-ge will prevent.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His patience is not eternal, although as long as Shen Qingqiu is fun he can grant him certain exemptions.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This Lord wonders..." Luo Bing-ge comments. With one arm still imprisoning Shen Qingqiu against him, he moves his other hand to hold his chin. His thumb brushes his pursed lips. "What plans does Shizun have for our wedding?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>His discomfort is immense, but Shen Qingqiu can't run away or escape his gaze with silly excuses. Still, his cracked facade remains. After all, he is a cultivator who was able to withstand the most inhuman torture while an eternity. </span>
<em>
<span>He can resist anything, right? </span>
</em>
<span>Luo Bing-ge thinks, narrowing his eyes. Perhaps he should satiate his appetite with the other, already broken. Accustomed to breaking up his enemies and lovers, Luo Bing-ge is on the verge of giving in to his impulses and waiting. And that fight flutters in his stomach.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu's silence is a clear answer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Bing-ge finally frees him. His relief is quite apparent despite his efforts to pretend otherwise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Let's play a game, will you, shizun? This Lord promises to be as good as shizun's behavior."</span>
</p><p>
<span>If Shen Qingqiu strives to love him, then Luo Bing-ge will also strive to control himself. But if Shen Qingqiu decides to betray his trust and fight, so... Luo Bing-ge smiles, showing his teeth, as he thinks of all he can do. But most of his ideas are unsatisfying, as they will end with a short reward and not the tasty goal he is after.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Perhaps he should speed up Liu Qingge's kidnapping. Or of his former dead brother. If in the end, Shen Qingqiu decides to give up, perhaps with the necessary encouragement he will learn to fake it.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>There is an idea that haunts Shen Yuan and he cannot forget. It's a desperate prospect that makes him wonder what's more important: Shen Jiu's life or decency. After another unsuccessful day, in which the three of them return to dinner at the bamboo house together, Shen Yuan makes a decision.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Placing his cup of tea on the table, he clears his throat and takes a deep breath as he tries to ignore the tingling of nerves inside his stomach.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This master thinks he has found a solution..." The other two's attention immediately turns to him. Shen Yuan feels guilty for getting his hopes up with an unlikely chance. Uncomfortable, he clears his throat again. "It's about Xin Mo, Luo Binghe."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge frowns as he listens to him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Haven't we decided that the demon would never use that sword again?"</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I know, Liu-shidi! It's not my fault that all the problems in PIDW were solved with Xin Mo in exchange for papapa!</span>
</em>
<span> Shen Yuan hides behind the fan so his expression won't betray him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I’m aware of that. For that very reason, this master will tell you what we know first, and we will all make a decision..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"There's no need." Luo Binghe announces with determination and a hand already on his waist, where he carries his two swords. "This disciple will do anything to rescue shizun."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge looks at the two of them without softening his misgivings before turning to Shen Yuan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Explain yourself."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Xin Mo is one of the most powerful artifacts in the entire world. It is possible that, despite the other Luo Bing-ge's protections, with the necessary encouragement it could affect the cracks we have already located."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What do you mean </span>
<em>
<span>encouragement</span>
</em>
<span>? Sacrifices?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Something like that..." He murmurs behind the fan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge crosses his arms and Luo Binghe stands up, furious.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"So, it looks like Liu-shishu is a hypocrite who doesn't care about shizun..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instantly, the cultivator also stood up to meet his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Of course, I care about him." He growls through clenched teeth. "But we can't sacrifice anyone else..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Not that kind of sacrifice, Liu-shidi." Shen Yuan intervenes before the two try to fight and break their house again. "There is no death or blood involved. However, manipulating Xin Mo means that Xin Mo will be able to manipulate you, Luo Binghe. It is dangerous and you must know all the consequences."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This disciple could..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Stop bragging, you arrogant brat." Liu Qingge interrupts him. "Have you already forgotten your previous qi deviations?" The truth is harsh and cruel. Luo Binghe bows his head without hiding his frustration against his own weakness. "Stop avoiding us, Shen Yuan. What kind of sacrifice?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan is about to die of embarrassment, but years of pretending to be Shen Qingqiu has taught him to maintain a deadpan facade. </span>
<em>
<span>Stop looking at me like that, Liu-shishu!</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>"Dual cultivation."</span>
</p><p>
<span>The other two freeze for a moment. Then they both blush. Luo Binghe opens his mouth without saying anything, looking at Shen Yuan, while Liu Qingge takes a step back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you insinuating… No way, Shen Yuan!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Luo Binghe doesn't have two interests? Of course, this master would talk to the people involved and inform them of the risks..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shen Yuan, forget it! Now!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan doesn't understand Liu Qingge's overreaction. Annoyed, he snaps the fan shut to look his friend into the eyes. Unfortunately, in a world where only the main character is allowed a fulfilling sex life, it is understandable that others are prudish. However, his brother's physical integrity is at stake and Shen Yuan cannot wait any longer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Can you let me finish talking? This master has already weighed in on all that that implies. Maybe it doesn't even work! Xin Mo feeds on dual cultivation and we're not interested in giving it too much power either, but what about a kiss? That way we would check my theory and how much it would take to open the way to the other world without complete dual cultivation."</span>
</p><p>
<span>He never imagined that Liu Qingge was so puritanical to blush so intensely at the prospect of a simple kiss. Though he's not surprised either, given his obsession with Shen Qingqiu's visits to brothels. Shen Yuan looks at Luo Binghe, the other one involved. The surprise over, his eyes are starting to sparkle with interest. Shen Yuan sighs. Although the book is now a real adventure, it is impossible to escape the impending romance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"So, Luo Binghe, what do you think?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It's a good idea, shizun, but..." Hearing him, Liu Qingge tenses up and glances at him sideways. "We shouldn't involve anyone else."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan tilts his head in confusion. He was sure that the protagonist would take an opportunity to make merit in front of his romantic interests. But even though there are two people in his heart, he is showing his maturity by putting Shen Jiu's rescue first. </span>
<em>
<span>What a filial disciple!</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>"So you're suggesting kissing one of us out of scientific interests?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe smirks with narrowed eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Indeed."</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Why is it suddenly so hot in the room?</span>
</em>
<span> It must be Liu Qingge’s rage, who is silently glaring at Luo Binghe. The cultivator has his hand on Cheng Luan's hilt and grits his teeth but is unable to find an argument against it. Although Shen Yuan has never been interested in men, he may be able to make an exception. Saving his brother is more important than a first kiss. Besides, curiosity tingles under his skin, around his fingers and chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Just a kiss then." Shen Yuan speaks without noticing that he is fiddling with the fan. "Immediately after, Luo Binghe, you must tell us what changes you notice in the sword. Understood?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Of course, shizun."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge looks at the two of them. First to Shen Yuan, who is shivering with nervousness and he doesn't know if the prospect of kissing Luo Binghe makes him uncomfortable or not. Then to Luo Binghe, who is closing in on his shizun. And after a brief interval of hesitation, the cultivator releases his grip on his sword and grabs Luo Binghe by the collar of his clothes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan drops his fan when the two hottest men in the world kiss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There is nothing romantic about the kiss, it is more of a fight. Although Luo Binghe's eyes widen in surprise, he immediately narrows them before attacking the cultivator. Well, Shen Yuan doesn't care if they decide to release all of his energy and rage in a duel for kiss supremacy. The way they try to trap each other is so violent that Luo Binghe ends up pinning Liu Qingge against the wall.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Please don't break anything..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge punches him to push him away, but Luo Binghe grabs his wrists and presses him hard against the wall. It’s quite rude, but Shen Yuan can't stop looking. There's something… strangely erotic about seeing the two of them kiss and he doesn't get it why. More heated, he begins to fan himself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This master thinks this is enough..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge bends his knees and kicks Luo Binghe in the stomach. When Shen Yuan already believed that the kiss was over with the War God's release, he reverses the roles.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You know what? This master has changed his mind. It’s still not enough. More passion."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe's insolence doesn't die despite being the one cornered against the wall, as he raises his hand to grab Liu Qingge's ass. A great ass that Shen Yuan is looking at with envy. He obviously doesn't want to touch his shidi's ass! Of course not! Unless…</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Stop biting. I see you. This master said no blood."</span>
</p><p>
<span>It would be a disaster if Liu Qingge ingested the demon blood just because they are two wild beasts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They keep fighting for more minutes. After knocking over a bookcase and almost ending up on the table, breaking several teacups, Shen Yuan sighs in resignation and stops giving them any further instructions. Of course, he doesn’t stop looking at the show. </span>
<em>
<span>Is it necessary to break clothes? Why are they dragging it out so long despite their enmity?</span>
</em>
<span> It is clear that for Luo Binghe it is just a scientific experiment (perhaps also a test) and that his filial spirit is just thinking of rescuing Shen Jiu. It's so adorable how he selflessly gives it all in one kiss. However, Liu Qingge...</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan frowns and for the first time he wonders if Liu Qingge is gay.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Such a beautiful man is also destined to fall into the hands of the protagonist, right?</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe doesn’t think about what he is doing. His instinct tells him to defeat Liu Qingge using any strategy. However, Shen Yuan's interest is unexpected and it fuels his fire. So he goes out of his way to punish his shishu for stealing the kiss he longed for.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They could stop at any moment, however, Luo Binghe only breaks the kiss upon noticing a disturbance with Xin Mo.</span>
</p><p>
<span>On the other side, someone is leading the way between worlds.</span>

<span>There is something ironic about the determination with which Shen Yuan crosses over to the other side. Despite the overprotective attitude of the other two, he is the first to walk through the portal that Luo Binghe created the moment he noticed a fluctuation in the wall between worlds. Despite all his efforts to avoid the original book, Shen Yuan no longer trembles at the prospect of facing Luo Bing-ge. And this time, it has been his own decision and not being forced by the System.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge and Luo Binghe follow him without hesitation. And the three arrive at a huge palace, more immense than some cities. It is a palace that aspires to outshine heaven and command respect tangled with terror. Holding on to his memories of the book, Shen Yuan guides his friends. His intention is, first, to hide so no gossipy servant will spread a rumor that the Demon Emperor is acting weird with two strangers. Second, locate where they are. And once he recognizes the place from Airplane's elaborate descriptions, Shen Yuan begins to walk. Fortunately, Shang Qinghua described Luo Bing-ge's palace in great detail in this section of the book: erotic scenes of the demon with his harem and scenes of bloody torture. Right now the data of the best places to fuck is not important, but finding the prison in which he locked Shen Qingqiu. And how to get to the cell.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At all that time, his stomach is crushed by the pressure. If it wasn't for the adrenaline coursing through his veins, Shen Yuan would have vomited by now. Besides that, he would be unable to continue forward, but he would try to run away in the opposite direction.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He is startled when someone grabs his hand. But it’s just Liu Qingge. After turning around, Shen Yuan meets his worried gaze. The touch of their intertwined fingers is warm and comforting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Are you okay?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan nods, hiding all of his discomfort behind an ambiguous smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Let's go on. This place is terrifying."</span>
</p><p>
<span>On his other side, Luo Binghe doesn't say anything. The demon gazes at the palace and the walls with a frown and dark eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Despite the urge to run to the prison, Shen Yuan forces himself to be cautious. The three of them slip away cautiously through the shadows and the untrodden paths, always avoiding the voices and the guards. His heart begins to pound as he recognizes the prison building. The anticipation he once felt reading those chapters has turned to panic. Luo Bing-ge took years to turn Shen Qingqiu into a human stick, but a demon who has already tasted blood will not hesitate to torture so much. Terror slows Shen Yuan's steps. He feels a lump in his throat and pressure in his chest. Breathing hurts, so he catches his breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Thanks to the descriptions in the book, Shen Yuan and his companions sneak into the prison. He even knows what the cell is. If Liu Qingge or Luo Binghe considers it suspicious, neither says anything. And the three move towards the inevitable in fearful silence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Once in front of the cell, Shen Yuan stops. The air stinks of blood, suffering, and putrefaction. His throat is dry. Recognizing his indecisiveness, Luo Binghe puts his arm around his shoulders in a comforting hug and rests his hand on the door. His demonic qi rips it to shreds.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The cell is cold and dark as a tomb.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Inside is a woman with braids dressed in green and a dismembered man.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan begins to hyperventilate. He enjoyed reading the cruel and gory scenes of torture, but there is a difference between the book and reality. Especially when Shen Qingqiu is no longer just his least favorite character, but his new brother. It hurts. Nausea climbs up his throat. Shen Yuan is barely aware that Luo Binghe is paralyzed and pale or that Liu Qingge has drawn his sword and rage shines in his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ahead of them, the woman, a more adult and less smiling version of Ning Yingying, looks at them in confusion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Husband? Shizun? What are you doing here?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan clumsily raises a hand and rests it on the forearm of Liu Qingge, who seems ready to commit murder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It's not Jiu-ge." Shen Yuan understands. The relief is brief since he no longer knows where he will find his brother in that insane world. "He is the other. He is the Shen Qingqiu of this world."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ning Yingying takes a step back. She still looks at Luo Binghe, but her expression immediately becomes horrified.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You are not them... You are from shizun’s world."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge lunges at her. With a swift blow, he pushes her to the ground, and the sword points at her neck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Who has done this?" He sputters. "What are you doing here?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ning Yingying trembles, unable to speak. Despite the horror of approaching the mutilated body of the original Shen Qingqiu, Shen Yuan runs towards them and grabs Liu Qingge by the wrist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"She would never hurt her shizun."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You do not know her!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I have also been her master. I know my disciple."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Despite having teary eyes, Ning Yingying dares to speak. Her voice is weak as the murmur of a little bird.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Have you come to rescue shizun?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe walks towards them. His footsteps startle Ning Yingying, who cringes a little more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Where is my shizun?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"He is staying at the Orchid Palace."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan frowns. This is the place where the newly arrived concubines stayed until they received their own rooms. It is a fact that he remembers perfectly and a blatant lie. Ning Yingying is a terrible liar.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Ning Yingying, I have come for my brother." He speaks in a conciliatory voice to gain her trust. Although Ning Yingying never played into the machinations of others, after the war she was never the same. "I'm not going to leave him here to end up like... like him."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan is trying to ignore the fact that this Shen Qingqiu is still alive and is probably listening to them. Or maybe he's asleep. His breathing is so light that it seems like an illusion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ning Yingying looks at him in confusion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I already told you. Shizun is in the Orchid Palace until the wedding."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"But Luo Bing-ge never..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge is hissing and Luo Binghe's expression has darkened. Before Shen Yuan finished speaking, the War God pointed his sword at the demon.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"If that monster has touched him, I swear I will kill him first and then you."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh, Liu-shishu, I'll let you kill him once I castrate him."</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Eh?</span>
</em>
<span> Shen Yuan blinks in confusion. For some reason, they do believe in his disciple. And, most terrifying, a sixth sense warns him that she doesn't seem to be lying. But that's strange revenge. Twisted. Humiliating. But not the kind of revenge that suits Luo Bing-ge, more fond of cruelly killing his enemies.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The two rivals exchange a look. Liu Qingge lowers his sword and heads towards Shen Qingqiu. Meanwhile, Luo Binghe kneels in front of Ning Yingying.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We need your help to rescue shizun. Could you tell us where the Orchid Palace is?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a straight blow, Liu Qingge releases his rage in severing Shen Qingqiu's chains and then gently holds him down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shen Yuan." He calls out to him. "Help me."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Despite disgust churning his stomach and his doubts, Shen Yuan walks towards them as he thinks about Shang Qinghua's words. Perhaps no Shen Qingqiu is a good person. But even if this is not his brother, he is someone who never deserved such cruel torture. Justice is faster than that inhuman agony. And this time, he cannot excuse Luo Bing-ge, who has committed many atrocities and kidnapped Shen Jiu. Despite the disgust that twists his guts, Shen Yuan stops in front of them and looks at the gaunt pallor of the real Shen Qingqiu. He is so thin that his ribs stand out under his skin and there is hardly any difference between his healthy eye and his hollow, both covered with dried blood. He looks like someone different from his brother, even though Shen Yuan knows that they are both the same person.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan wonders if Liu Qingge will be able to offer him the painless death that Shen Qingqiu deserves.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And if he will be able to bear it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>However, Liu Qingge passes the body to him. It’s as light as holding a bag of bones. Luo Binghe gets up. With a flick of the wrist, he creates a portal out of nothing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan understands his intentions too late when he is pushed to the other side. And he lands in Cang Qiong Mountain Sect with the Shen Qingqiu that he never expected to rescue. Right away he recognizes the smell of medicinal plants. They are on Qian Cao Peak, but even that scent and the bright sun cannot erase the cold and unpleasant memory of the prison.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe doesn't dodge Liu Qingge's punch. Now that Shen Yuan is safe with the Shen Qingqiu of this world, neither of them mind pretending anymore. A second punch hits him on the cheekbone. The third does not arrive. Liu Qingge gasps in front of him, furious like a wounded animal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"That's your fucking fault." He hisses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I know."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No, you don't!" Although Liu Qingge screams, he clings to his willpower to sheath the sword instead of fighting anymore. "Your selfishness and arrogance allowed this monster to kidnap him. But he is doing the same as you!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>That fuels Luo Binghe's rage, who clenches his fists.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I never...!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Never what!? Would you kidnap Shen Jiu against his will? Force him to give him your blood? Lock him up in a fancy palace? You did!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You've already reproached me!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"But you still have no regrets!" Liu Qingge points out the place where the other Shen Qingqiu was. "He could have done the same to him! Your other self is a monster." Liu Qingge takes a deep breath as he drops his arm. And he gives him one last look of contempt. "You can be him. Never forget it."</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Liu Qingge is wrong.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe regrets it. When they find Shen Jiu, he will apologize. His gaze stops at the bloodstains. They are huge puddles that cover almost the entire ground. Despite the fleeting glimpse, he is well aware of the other Shen Qingqiu's status. The mutilations. The scars. That horror is etched into his retinas, and nausea shakes his stomach. As they walked inside the walls, Luo Binghe was aware of being in a twisted version of his dreams. But he never wished to harm any shizun, only to understand their abandonment and why he was pushed into the Endless Abyss. The cruelty of this Shen Qingqiu's injuries makes him shiver.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He will try to help Shen Qingqiu. It’s a promise. Although his other self broke him, he has the power to heal him. Perhaps they share obsessions, but they are not meant to be the same person as long as they make different decisions.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe regrets it and that is another difference between them.</span>

<p>
<span>When Luo Binghe arrived at this world, he was overwhelmed after feeling his blood spread inside so many people. Perhaps with a little practice, he would be able to pick Shen Jiu out of so many vague signals, but they are running out of time, so he heads towards Ning Yingying. She is also marked by his blood. It's strange, almost unimaginable. Despite the fact that for others the two of them are the same person, Luo Binghe doesn’t have a hard time separating himself from his other self thanks to those kinds of decisions.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He would never offer his blood indiscriminately, though something inside him, perhaps the echo of the boy he once was, wonders what it would be like to have so many bonds. Luo Bing-ge is not only more cunning and powerful, but his palace is also bigger, his dreams more ambitious. He also seems better accompanied.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe begins to understand that apart from his two shizuns, he doesn't have anyone else. His friendship with Ning Yingying or Liu Mingyan was broken when he fell into the Endless Abyss. He has no more friends or trusted people. His relationship with the demons is marked by respect and his heart pursues two people who may never reciprocate him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This is not the time to be distracted or think of such nonsense when Shen Jiu is in danger, but his heart sinks under the weight of loneliness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This Ning Yingying is unable to deny anything to Luo Binghe, even when her fear is evident. She rubs her hands together nervously, her gaze still lost in the space where the portal Shen Yuan and Shen Qingqiu returned through was. With a sigh, she shakes her head and begins to smooth the wrinkles out of her clothes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I can guide you to the Orchid Palace." She murmurs in a cautious voice, looking at the two of them. "This humble wife often visits shizun. No one will suspect a thing. And my lord can accompany me..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>That nickname makes him cringe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Luo Binghe." He interrupts her. "Just Luo Binghe. Don't call me that."</span>
</p><p>
<span>A flash of panic flashes across her eyes and she quickly ducks her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This humble wife is so sorry..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe wants to interrupt her again and tell her that she is not her wife, neither is she in another world nor will she ever be, but he is afraid that it will scare her even more. Liu Qingge, who is looking at the two of them with his arms crossed, seems to have understood the problem as well. He snorts before intervening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What you are trying to imply is that Luo Binghe can pose as your husband?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Exactly!" Ning Yingying finally raises her head. "They are identical! And no one will stop or dare to question our lord! Besides, my husband visits shizun quite often. We can walk to the Orchid Palace and enter without raising any suspicions."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge frowns. Although Ning Yingying still hasn't mentioned anything about a certain complication, both of them are aware of the problem.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What about me? Should I wait for you here? No way! This bastard is capable of abandoning me here and running off with Shen Jiu."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe doesn’t defend himself. Honestly, it's a tempting idea. After all, the most sensible thing is to open the portal once they find Shen Jiu and disappear from this hell. The longer they are here and the more they are seen, the more likely they are to attract the other Luo Bing-ge's attention.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ning Yingying bows her head apologetically in a gesture so submissive that even Liu Qingge seems to regret his harsh words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This stupid wife apologizes. I didn't mean to offend Liu-shishu nor did I plan to imply Liu-shishu staying here."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It's okay." He growls as he looks away, uncomfortable. "What's your idea?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"If you'll let me, this wife can go get you a costume."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe narrows his eyes. Even he doesn't know how far his trust goes for that Ning Yingying, as harmless as terrified. However, it is an interesting idea.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What kind of costume?" The demon intervenes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Wel... Liu-shishu looks a lot like his sister."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"My sister?" He stammers. "What does Mingyan have to do with this?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge is pale and his eyes wide in confusion. Although his intelligence is limited, everyone is aware of the other Luo Bing-ge's appetites. Luo Binghe laughs without hiding his malice. His smile is mocking as he gazes at his rival, who clenches his fists before glaring at him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"That's an excellent idea, Ning-shijie." The demon purrs, savoring his impending humiliation. "Liu Mingyan always wears a veil. With his hidden features, it will be easy to confuse them." He steps forward. Despite the tension, Liu Qingge does not back down. "And Liu-shishu's figure is just as slender, graceful... and delicate."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I'm going to kill you, beast. Slowly." He hisses through clenched teeth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh!" Luo Binghe pretends to be offended. "Shizun will be angry when he finds out we couldn't rescue him because </span>
<em>
<span>someone </span>
</em>
<span>can't work as a team."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>The demon turns its back, ignoring him, to look at Ning Yingying.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Go get that costume." For the moment, he decides to trust her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No, Ning Yingying can’t be a bad person and there is something special about someone who still visits Shen Qingqiu despite his horrible state. She bows respectfully before running for the exit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Furious, Liu Qingge punches him in the ribs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don't make decisions without my opinion!" He growls. "Maybe she's gone to rat us out!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"She will not."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"How do you know?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Because she fears Luo Binghe." The demon smiles bitterly. "And in her eyes, I am Luo Binghe."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge snorts without softening his suspicion. Luo Binghe doesn't trust him either but trusts his abilities and his loyalty to Shen Jiu, so for once he is willing to work with his rival. Or at least try.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shizun is in danger. And I will do anything to rescue him. What about you, Liu-shishu?" His gaze grows colder and his smile disappears. "Would you try to control your temper for once?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I'm not the one who is at risk of a qi deviation..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"But Liu-shishu has also had qi deviations in the past, am I wrong?" He cuts him off. "And your first reaction upon arriving here was to attack a possible ally. Shizun doesn't need your rage but your collaboration. So, are you going to work with me to rescue him, or do I have to subdue you first? If it's a fight you want, you'll have it." Despite the confidence in his voice, Luo Binghe is aware of that desire for blood and violence buried deep in his chest. He has overused Xin Mo to open two portals and the wishes of the sword have been rekindled. "We can fight. But later. When we're home. Until now, would you be my fake wife?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge is flushed with fury, but he turns away while clicking his tongue.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Fine."</span>
</p><p>
<span>His growl is almost inaudible and Luo Binghe wishes to mock him, but it is an unheard fact that the proud War God has relented and for Shen Jiu's sake, he won’t be the one to boycott this mission.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But he will remind Liu Qingge in the future, of course. This will be an unforgettable memory.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Despite Liu Qingge's misgivings, Ning Yingying returns with a bunch of clothes. He offers Luo Binghe other outer robes that the real Demon Lord had forgotten in her rooms. Although they both wear the same colors, Luo Binghe immediately appreciates the difference in quality. The fabric of these outer robes is heavier and more expensive. Despite the distaste of wearing something that belongs to his other self, Luo Binghe doesn't hesitate to take off his and dress in them. It's like putting on another person's skin. And he fears that it will make him a little more like Luo Bing-ge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Even though those outer robes are stylish and make him feel like an emperor, he wants to rip them off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At the other end of the cell, Ning Yingying is helping Liu Qingge dress up. She hasn’t just brought a white dress, but she has also let down his hair and is combing it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"The dress belongs to this wife." She explains as she braids his hair. "This wife has not dared to enter Liu Mingyan's rooms, but I know her style."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe walks towards them with curious steps. Although Ning Yingying has chosen a loose dress that covers Liu Qingge's muscular arms, it is easy for him to recognize him. However, the different hairstyle and veil blur his features. Unfortunately, his gaze is too fierce. Liu Qingge glares at Luo Binghe when he playfully approaches.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Liu-shishu is very pretty, great job Ning-shijie." He comments. "But, Liu-shishu, your eyes are too terrifying. You won't fool anyone."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh, Liu Mingyan is like that too." Ning Yingying intervenes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe's smile freezes. In his memories, Liu Mingyan is a mischievous young woman, calm and without her brother's aggressiveness. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Everything is wrong in this world.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ning Yingying also applies makeup to Liu Qingge and then helps Luo Binghe with his hair to imitate the Demon Lord's hairstyle. Once they are ready, the three of them leave the cell. Luo Binghe breathes the clean air outside. The stink of blood and rotten flesh is still inside his lungs and he fears he will never forget it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although they are in a private area where there are few servants and guards, as Ning Yingying explains to them, she hugs her left arm. Walking like that is uncomfortable. Luo Binghe pretends that she is Shen Yuan. If he doesn't look directly at her, he may be fooled by her green clothes into imagining that she is someone else. That helps him relax and gain confidence with every step. However, Liu Qingge makes no effort to act. He walks beside them with impatient steps. And although Liu Mingyan is also a warrior, Luo Binghe suspects that she would never move with such inelegant brusqueness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they approach more crowded areas, Luo Binghe sighs before reaching out with his other arm and grabbing Liu Qingge around the waist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Just relax." He hisses at him despite his fake smile. "Only for half an hour."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don’t touch me."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe doesn't stop him from getting rid of him, however, Ning Yingying still scolds them in a fearful voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Please, Liu-shishu. Liu Mingyan doesn't act like that."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"My sister is a warrior, not the complement of a demon."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This humble wife doesn't mean to offend Liu-shishu, but you seem to want to kill someone. You are too angry."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Because I am!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Me too." Luo Binghe growls, annoyed at his terrible cooperation. "And I don't have the help of a veil. Just pretend… Imagine that you have disguised yourself to meet Shizun on a secret date."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Why would I disguise myself to meet Shen Jiu?" He frowns even deeper. "Besides, you would ruin any date."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"In which I have not been invited? Indeed."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"My husband... Liu-shishu... Please..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge hisses in anger before walking closer to his side. And slowly, with tense movements, he grabs Luo Binghe's left arm. Despite his vivid imagination, the demon is unable to ignore the fact that Liu Qingge is hugging him. Or rather, squeezing his arm hard enough to break a bone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don't be so hard, Liu-shishu." He leans down to whisper in his ear. "You look like a neglected wife."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now Liu Qingge is digging his nails into him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Stop talking."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe's smile grows like that of a hungry wolf. It's strange. Ning Yingying's closeness makes him uncomfortable, but Liu Qingge's is funny.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They keep walking. But as Ning Yingying has already warned them, soon on their way they come across guards, servants, court members, and other women whom Luo Binghe identifies as more wives. </span>
<em>
<span>Ambitious bastard</span>
</em>
<span>, he hisses as he thinks of his other self. No one pays attention to Ning Yingying, who walks beside the demon as naturally as usual, and no one dares to look into Luo Binghe's eyes. Humans and demons bow and greet him with respectful voices. But some gazes, especially those in the harem, linger longer than necessary on Liu Qingge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Luo Binghe can hear their gossip.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Isn't Liu Mingyan a little weird today?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Is she angry that our husband prefers Shen Qingqiu?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Perhaps they have discussed..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I don't know... Something seems off."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe clicks his tongue. At the same time, he notices the cultivator's stiffness. Obviously, his senses are as sharp as his and he has heard them too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Relax, Liu-shishu."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I'm trying." He hisses, clutching him tighter. His fingernails are starting to tear the fabric of the sleeve.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Try better."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Fuck you."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I think that's what the others expect." Although teasing Liu Qingge is fun, it's a dangerous game when the real Demon Lord can appear at any moment. "Let's try something different. Let go of both of you."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge doesn’t hesitate to follow his instructions this time. Ning Yingying doesn't either, though she's still shivering and nervously rubbing her hands together. Luo Binghe puts an arm around Liu Qingge's waist and pulls him close so that now others won't be able to see his face so easily. His furious look is just for him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Let's continue, Ning-shijie."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe hears Liu Qingge growl. It sounds like the roar of a wild animal, but at least he has assumed his lack of acting skills and reluctantly agrees to hide in Luo Binghe with a hug. Now the demon's hand rests on his back as Liu Qingge clings to him. Next to them, Ning Yingying shows them that it is possible to walk normally without arousing suspicion despite not hugging him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And so, step by step, they made their way to the Orchid Palace.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu tries to enjoy a quiet moment when the door to the room bursts open. </span>
<em>
<span>Who will it be now?</span>
</em>
<span> He thinks, annoyed, as he sits up. His mood sours as he recognizes the dark figure of Luo Bing-ge, accompanied by two of his wives. Still, Shen Jiu hides all of his emotions behind a merely curious facade.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shizun!" Ning Yingying screams and cries as she rushes towards him with an abruptness too disrespectful for a lady of her current prestige.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The hug is a collision that makes him stumble. Shen Jiu holds her by the shoulders since he has a feeling that her former disciple is about to collapse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What's wrong?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Raising his head, his gaze met Luo Binghe's. The demon has tears in his eyes. Although Shen Jiu opens his mouth, all of his words sink in confusion. And next to the demon...</span>
</p><p>
<span>His heart races.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A long time ago, Shen Jiu was abandoned in hell behind the walls of a beautiful mansion. He waited for Qi-Ge, but Qi-Ge rebuilt his miserable life, forgetting about him in exchange for a promising future. He waited and waited. He waited until they shattered him into pieces so sharp that they destroyed all the monsters. He survived incompletely. He found Qi-Ge. His heart darkened even more. He was unhappy but his dreams began to come true. He managed to enter Cang Qiong Peak. His life continued to be unhappy. He rose to Peak Lord. Everyone despised him. He despised everyone. He got used to Shen Qingqiu's name and unhappiness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He found a brother.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His brother disappeared and he waited while all the unseen wounds he had collected ate at him in silent sickness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu had grown tired of waiting. In the end, he had learned the lesson: his life wasn’t valuable. No one would come back for him, so he should stop waiting and fight before it was too late. He was no longer a helpless child or a slave. He had power and weapons, he had the determination to face a demon and win with his wits alone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although he wasn’t waiting for anyone anymore, still, his eyes fill with tears. Furious, he covers his face with both hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shen Jiu?" A voice mutters cautiously.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shizun, I... I'm so sorry... It was this disciple's fault… Is… Is shizun okay?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu hears footsteps approaching him. They are real. Despite being in another world, they have defied the impossible to search for him. He is not alone. He never was, even though Shen Yuan had disappeared. His world is not locked inside his bamboo house. It's bigger than his pessimistically blinded mind believed. Shen Jiu can't say anything as a sob strangles his throat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His body moves instinctively. And Shen Jiu walks away from Ning Yingying to hug Luo Binghe and Liu Qingge awkwardly, clutching at his clothes and crying as something inside him snaps, breaking free. It is a weight that disappears. It hurts like a wound healing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They are also hugging him as if that dirty slave is the most precious thing in the universe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After many years, someone has come back for him.</span>

<p>
<span>Liu Qingge watches as Shen Jiu slowly collects himself, breaking the embrace as he retrieves the broken shards of his control. He takes a deep breath before wiping the tears away with his sleeve. Despite his delicate movements, Shen Jiu still trembles. Liu Qingge wants to hold his hand and promise him that he is safe, but in the end, he keeps quiet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a few seconds, no one says anything. Then, silence breaks out as Shen Qingqiu slaps Luo Binghe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although the demon could have dodged it, he accepts the blow like all of Liu Qingge's. Luo Binghe lowers his head and his dark curls cover his expression.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shizun, I'm sorry..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Another slap.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Stop apologizing." Shen Jiu hisses, lowering his arm. "If you're really sorry, prove it and get us out of here..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>They all are startled when the door opens.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I was quite curious when I heard that my husband was heading to the Orchid Palace with Ning Yingying and… Well, me." Liu Mingyan walks into the rooms in an icy rage. In this world, his sister is much more serious and there is no light in her eyes. Not even her veil is enough to hide her gloomy expression. This Liu Mingyan has been sharpened and hate echoes in every step. "My lord, I'm afraid that another shapeshifting demoness is trying to trick you... Or maybe an enemy spy?" She draws Shui Se. "There is only one way to confirm it."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then her gaze meets Liu Qingge's and her eyes widen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Ge?..." She murmurs in a voice torn by pain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her pulse trembles and so does her sword. Liu Mingyan's gaze shifts from him to Luo Binghe and then to Shen Jiu, who moves to stand next to Liu Qingge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Do you believe me now when I said your brother was alive?" Shen Jiu says in a honeyed voice, holding Liu Qingge's arm. It is not a hug, but a protective gesture. Liu Qingge notices his tension and that he has narrowed his eyes despite his seemingly calm expression.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Ge... Is that you? Is it really you?" Liu Mingyan babbles with tears shining in her eyes as she takes a step forward. "How...?" Her attention returns to Luo Binghe. Beneath her tears shines disappointment. "My lord, what are you doing with my brother?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe doesn’t dare to say anything. Clever demon. Liu Mingyan hasn't figured out the fraud yet, but any mistake can put them in a bind. She is his sister and Liu Qingge wants to trust her just like Luo Binghe decided to trust her shijie. But he must carefully reveal the truth or Liu Mingyan will give them away by mistake.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Liu Mingyan, listen to me..." He starts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But then Shen Jiu grabs him by the lapels of his dress and kisses him. It is such an unexpected gesture that Liu Qingge opens his mouth in surprise, allowing Shen Jiu to deepen the kiss. Although that is something he has always wanted, he cannot understand his motives. Furthermore, it tastes like falsehood, deceit, and lies.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What are you doing, Shen Qingqiu!?" Liu Mingyan growls, rushing towards them as fast as a breeze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Perhaps she would have tried to stab him if Luo Binghe had not interceded, grabbing her wrist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Enough."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu separates from Liu Qingge without moving away from him. His arms encircle his neck with mock flirtatiousness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"He is my price. My future husband has offered him to me as a wedding present." He purrs. "Now I have no reason to reject Luo Binghe..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shen Jiu!" Liu Qingge warns him, confused but upset.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But before he can deny it, Shen Jiu kisses him again. This time, Liu Qingge puts his hands on his shoulders to pull him away, but Shen Jiu sinks his fingers into his hair. It is captivating to be swept away by him, but Liu Mingyan is his sister, his weakest point, and Liu Qingge considers it unfair to deceive her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they fight kissing, Liu Mingyan scolds Luo Binghe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You dare cheat on your first wife!?" She hisses. "Why!? Why have you brought my brother to sell him to Shen Qingqiu!?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This lord is not particularly pleased with shizun's affection for Liu-shishu." Luo Binghe acknowledges with a growl. His jealousy is sincere and adds a touch of authenticity to his words. "Of course, there are conditions. Shizun has promised me that he will do the same he does to Liu-shishu and twice with me… and this lord will taste Liu-shishu first."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu stops, choking, and Liu Qingge takes this opportunity to pull him away. Despite being able to speak, he is confused and speechless.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You won't touch my brother!" Liu Mingyan roars. "I don't care that you are my husband. You have all the women you want. I have never controlled you or forced you to follow any limits, even when you took a fancy to that scum..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>She is his sister, she has the same face and the same sword, but her words are dark and twisted, making Liu Qingge feel uncomfortable. There is something terrible inside her. He can feel it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don't call shizun that." Luo Binghe growls and his eyes narrow dangerously.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Why not? Have you already forgotten what he did!? Our pain? He's a monster."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"And you not?" Luo Binghe leans towards her threateningly. "You said it yourself: you don't care what I do to shizun or any other of... </span>
<em>
<span>my </span>
</em>
<span>women. But you only react when it involves your brother. What a hypocrite."</span>
</p><p>
<span>The desire to protect his little sister beats in his heart, but Liu Qingge is paralyzed. He is startled when Shen Jiu places his hands on his cheeks and turns his head to look into his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Sorry." He murmurs. "I wish you hadn't met her. This world is rotten."</span>
</p><p>
<span>This Liu Mingyan is rotten.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Maybe I am, but I won't be the only hypocrite! How did you go from dismembering that bastard to wanting to take him to bed?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge feels nauseated remembering the other Shen Qingqiu. And a certainty passes through him. He grabs Shen Jiu's wrists to pull him away and look at his sister.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You knew it?" He sputters breathlessly. "Did you know what they did to him and you never stopped him?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Mingyan holds his gaze without a trace of regret.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"He deserved it."</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Liu Qingge understands why Shen Jiu has desperately tried to keep her from finding out the truth. It hurts to see her sister turned into that kind of person. She is a monster almost worse than Luo Binghe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Leave."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What?" She babbles with wide eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I never want to see you again."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"But...Ge..." Her anger evaporates, replaced by confusion. "I can't leave you alone."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You can just like you abandoned Shen Qingqiu."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"He killed you!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"He wouldn’t do it!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Mingyan..." Ning Yingying's sweet voice chimes in. The young woman, who until then had stayed away from them, approaches her and puts her hands on her shoulders. "Come with me. I will talk to A-Luo. He will listen to me."</span>
</p><p>
<span>And with promises, she drags her towards the door. Liu Mingyan's resistance weakens as Ning Yingying manages to convince her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The three of them breathe a sigh of relief when the door closes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Great job, Liu-shishu." Luo Binghe sneers sarcastically. "You almost screwed up."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge ignores him. He covers his face with one hand as he waits for his heart to settle. It still hurts. Seeing his sister has been something terrifying and that he won’t forget soon.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I never imagined that she would become like this…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>"She is not the worst. In this world, everyone is rotten, broken, or dead." Shen Jiu comments harshly, but they recognize that his voice is weak and the sadness in his eyes. And no one dares to ask him what he has seen during his stay in this hell. "What about you, Luo Binghe? How did you know we couldn't trust her?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>The demon shrugs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I trusted shizun."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although Shen Jiu is still angry with the demon, his response manages to soften his bad mood. He crosses his arms and twists his lips in a grimace, but Liu Qingge appreciates that Luo Binghe has broken through his armor. That's dangerous.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We should go now." Liu Qingge says.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe nods. Despite the ordeal he had suffered until they found Shen Jiu, the demon is now unexpectedly assertive. He doesn't hesitate to draw his sword.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Wait." Shen Jiu stops him with a raised hand. "We can't leave yet."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Cang Qiong Mountain Sect is in chaos when Shen Yuan returns with the rotting and dismembered body of the original Shen Qingqiu. Although Yue Qingyuan and Mu Qingfang's terror subsides when he explains that he is not Shen Jiu, his horror remains when they help carry him to Qian Cao Peak. The news soon spreads like wildfire and they must scare away all the curious. Although Shen Qingqiu seems to sleep in the prison, the change of world and the cultivators' yells are stressing him out. Shen Yuan notices it even though he insists on keeping his one eye tightly shut.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu probably thinks that he is trapped in a nightmare.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Once at Qian Cao Peak, Mu Qingfang takes Shen Qingqiu intending to wash him, disinfect his wounds and make a general assessment of his health. Yue Qingyuan offers to help him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No need, Zhangmen-shixiong." Mu Qingfang tells him. "My disciples are qualified."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Although he is not our Shen Jiu, he is still a Peak Lord. He... deserves respect and intimacy. I will not leave him."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Something in Yue Qingyuan's words makes Shen Qingqiu's single eye tear up. Despite his weakness, he keeps hiding (or trying to) that weakness by keeping his eye closed. Like his brother. Because Shen Qingqiu and Shen Jiu are almost the same person. Shen Yuan's guts twist and nausea fills his throat as he gazes at him, too tiny and fragile in Mu Qingfang's arms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His presence is unnecessary, so Shen Yuan flees. Not even the air sweetened by medicinal plants is enough to erase the memory of the prison of horrors. Breathing, Shen Yuan still smells the stench of blood and rotten meat in his lungs. </span>
<em>
<span>Will he recover? </span>
</em>
<span>Mu Qingfang has commented that they can use Shen Jiu's Sun and Moon Dew Flower seed, but planting a body will take at least several years.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The curiosity of the other Peak Lords draws them towards him, but Shen Yuan is unable to speak to anyone, not even Shang Qinghua. And the others slowly understand that he needs space and quiet. Shen Yuan is lost in his thoughts as lightning cuts through the air. And a portal appears out of nowhere. He gets up accompanied by a chorus of restless, distrustful, and nervous voices. Liu Qingge jumps out of the portal, relieving the tension crushing his heart. Liu Qingge's clothes are wrinkled and his hair is pulled back into a quick ponytail as if he had gotten into a fight with someone. To his relief, Shen Yuan doesn't recognize blood. Liu Qingge turns to help first Ning Yingying through the portal, then…</span>
</p><p>
<span>His brother.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan breaks into a run. Today he appreciates the speed of the cultivators more than ever because, by the time Shen Jiu hits the ground, he has already reached his side and hugs him tightly. Shen Jiu stumbles but manages to keep his balance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Jiu-Ge you're back!" He stammers, slurring the words from his throat instead of sobbing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What do you say, silly? You're the one who left, A-Yuan." There is no rancor in his voice, just immense relief. "Don't leave me again."<br/></span>
</p><p>
<span>"Nevermore."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan buries his face into Shen Jiu as he hugs him tightly. He hears the voices of Liu Qingge and Luo Binghe, of everyone else, of a Ning Yingying who asks if it's okay for her to be there. Shen Yuan smiles before sighing. And his heart is light and happy, free from the panic of the last few days.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s over.</span>

<p>
<span>That hug was the most intense and longest affectionate gesture that Shen Jiu had dedicated to him (and to no one, in fact).</span>
</p><p>
<span>Unfortunately, it doesn't take long for Shen Jiu to return to normal. And when they drag him to Qian Cao Peak, he is back to being that sullen and whining cat who disdains his own health. Shen Yuan considers it a miracle that he hasn't scratched anyone, even though intent shines in his merciless eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Enough!" Shen Jiu hisses after Mu Qingfang gives him a quick check. "This master wishes to return to his house. Alone."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Well, even Shen Yuan is aware that with so many people gathered in the room it can get suffocating so it’s a great plan. Also, he is included in that </span>
<em>
<span>alone</span>
</em>
<span>. Privileges of being his brother. Shen Jiu stands up, intending to head for the exit, but he stops to look at Luo Binghe. Even though he is one of the most powerful assembled there, a Demon Lord with two palaces and an army, he pales under Shen Jiu's piercing gaze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Remove your blood from me." He orders him in a cold, sharp voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe lowers his head. Shen Yuan is unable to tell if his expression is one of regret or disappointment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yes, Shizun." He murmurs in a small voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu seems happy once the two of them return to the bamboo house, which will no longer be cold or empty.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I'm going to take away those clothes." Shen Jiu growls. "And this mess?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan clears his throat. Perhaps someone did not have time to clean up the chaos of manuscripts and books piled on the table and even the floor. He has a good excuse: there was no time for minutiae when they rushed to the other world. Even so, the appearance of the usual pristine house is embarrassing and Shen Yuan rushes to pick up the junk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He longs for those days with Liu Qingge and Luo Binghe helping him keep order. The two of them are wonderful househusbands. Shen Yuan thinks about inviting them to dinner. Not because they are terrible at cooking and need their help to survive. Of course not. It's to celebrate Shen Jiu’s rescue.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And for the food.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Once dressed in his Peak Lord clothes, Shen Jiu doesn’t leave his side. Shen Yuan already knows that he is not a person who tends to show physical affection. Shen Jiu simply stands by him, asking questions and making observations about the house, the state of the peak, and the future in general. It’s comforting despite spending nearly two hours picking up. Shen Yuan is starting to consider the possibility of punishing Luo Binghe for all his pranks by making him his assistant.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan doesn’t take long to convince Shen Jiu to have the other two come over for dinner. He would also like to celebrate it with his disciples and the other Peak Lords, but he knows that would overwhelm his brother. So he decides to start with something small.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Despite having rescued Shen Jiu, the animosity between Luo Binghe and Liu Qingge hasn’t disappeared. It is different, yes, a still aggressive tension but softer in a certain way. They no longer seem to want to kill each other and for Shen Yuan that is a breakthrough. Besides, as long as they keep bickering over trifles like who's in charge of the food, he still has Shen Jiu to himself. But later, when the four of them are already seated at the table in front of an oversized banquet, the two fight for Shen Jiu's attention.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan is not stupid. He appreciates that Shen Jiu is smiling behind the fan and that he is enjoying their attention. </span>
<em>
<span>Stupid tsundere</span>
</em>
<span>, he sighs, eating non-stop. The food is excellent as always and someone must savor it while the others play.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This master is curious." Shen Jiu nonchalantly comments, but Shen Yuan recognizes that questioning look. It is the same he uses when he examines his disciples. "When I was in the other world, Luo Binghe, where did you stay? At Qing Jing Peak?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No, Shizun." He responds with his perfect white sheep attitude. "This disciple would not dare. I’m at Bai Zhan Peak."</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Tsk, what a liar. </span>
</em>
<span>Shen Yuan thinks, amused. </span>
<em>
<span>It was Liu-shidi who dragged you away.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>"Bai Zhan Peak." Shen Jiu repeats, frowning slightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe's eyes light up upon hearing his reaction. Though he doesn't break his facade, the demon flashes a tiny mischievous smirk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yes, shizun. Liu-shishu was kind enough to let me stay at his home."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge, who had been eating in silence until now, tenses up and turns to scrutinize the demon warily.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You're staying... with Liu Qingge?" That discovery stuns Shen Jiu, who has unconsciously lowered the fan enough, and now they can see his puzzled expression. “In the same house?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe blinks with feigned innocence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yes, Shizun." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu turns to Liu Qingge, waiting for him to confirm that fact. But the War God has frowned and remains as alert as a wild animal. Meanwhile, Shen Yuan pops some marinated beef into his mouth. He would be lying if he denied how much he is enjoying that show.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It's not a big deal." Liu Qingge finally growls. "I wasn't going to leave this beast without surveillance on Qing Jing Peak."</span>
</p><p>
<span>That seems to calm Shen Jiu down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Good decision, shidi. Although this master is still curious about Luo Binghe's definition of </span>
<em>
<span>kind</span>
</em>
<span>."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu surely thinks that it was sarcasm and that the demon would take that opportunity to attack Liu Qingge. However, his smile doesn’t disappear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Liu-shishu is a great host. This disciple is very grateful for his hospitality. Although…" Luo Binghe pauses and Liu Qingge narrows his eyes even more. "This disciple would appreciate Liu-shishu buying another bed."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan chokes on his food. </span>
<em>
<span>Binghe! Don't say that with such a serious face!</span>
</em>
<span> He's still coughing when Shen Jiu turns to pass him his cup.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"So...another bed..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yes, shizun. Liu-shishu only has a small, narrow bed."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan feels that he is going to choke with the food. What is Luo Binghe playing at with such ambiguous words? And more importantly, why isn't Shen Jiu aware that he is provoking him? Although his tension is different from Liu Qingge's. Shen Yuan notices that his brother is breathing rapidly, and a slight blush covers his cheeks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Beast." Liu Qingge warns him with a growl.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What? It's true. Even though young shizun said that Liu-shishu should be good, this disciple wakes up with a sore back every morning."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now Luo Binghe dares to tear up. Shen Yuan no longer plans to continue eating. This show is better than the series he used to enjoy in his past life.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don't listen to him." Liu Qingge growls, turning around in disdain. "He is sleeping on the floor, nothing else."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Nothing else?" Luo Binghe repeats still in his honeyed voice. “After what had happened between us, this disciple believed that we were already closer… Qingge.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although Shen Yuan is holding back his laughter at their reactions, it is not lost on him that Shen Jiu almost drops his fan. Luckily, the other two are too busy bothering each other. Or not to start a fight at that precise moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Do you have a death wish, demon?" Liu Qingge growls, punching the table so hard it cracks. "Stop that. We are not close and never will be. You don't even think of calling me by my name again, nor does shishu. You don't belong to this sect anymore."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Hmm...Ge'er?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge stands up and this time he draws his sword.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Stop!" Shen Jiu intervenes, afraid that they are going to fight. He has closed the fan with a snap and uses it to aim at the demon. "Luo Binghe, stop talking nonsense and offending Liu Qingge."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Why? He can kiss me but I can't tease him?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>And the bomb falls. The two cultivators pale, and Shen Yuan is sure he saw Luo Binghe smack his lips. Although he continues to bat his eyelashes with the sweet innocence of a maiden, the demon smirks malevolently. Shen Yuan fans himself. His brother is not stupid and with a glance, he finds out that Luo Binghe is telling the truth. And on this occasion, his words cannot be misunderstood.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu stands up, pale and livid, and points to the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Both of you. Get out."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe sighs. And Shen Yuan watches curiously how he doesn't look at Shen Jiu, but leans towards the War God still with that mischievous smirk on his hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Are we going home, Qingge?"</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Why...? </span>
</em>
<span>Shen Yuan's throat is dry. His gaze shifts from the furious Liu Qingge striding away probably to avoid a fight, to Luo Binghe ignoring Shen Jiu, and to his brother's fury. Rage is common in Shen Jiu, almost a second heart. It pulses through his veins, stronger than his spiritual energy. But until then, his anger had always been cold and aggressive, not silent and marked by trembling of limbs. Shen Jiu is blushing as he walks away from the table muttering under his breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Stupid fickle libertine demon…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Humm..." Shen Yuan brings the tip of his fan to his lips. He has the absurd feeling that Luo Binghe was trying to make Shen Jiu jealous. That strategy appeared repeatedly in PIDW and usually ended in a threesome between the Demon Lord and two of his wives. The more he thinks about it, the more confident Shen Yuan is in understanding Luo Binghe's strategy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And with a shiver, he remembers that the other Luo Bing-ge did not torture his brother, but took him to... the palace of future...</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Fuck.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>The next morning, Shen Yuan shows up at An Ding Peak like a gale, opening the door of Shang Qinghua's house with his qi without bothering to knock. Luckily he is working at his desk instead of sleeping.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Cucumber bro?” The other transmigrator sputters, surprised and uneasy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Can you tell me what's going on between my brother, Liu-shidi and Luo Binghe?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>That traitorous weasel Shang Qinghua bursts into thunderous laughter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Ah! You've finally figured out the romantic plot! It took you a long time, Cucumber bro..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan drops his fan on the ground.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Romantic...plot?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yeah. I mean, even though you've changed the story, you can't avoid some things like Luo Binghe falling in love. Well... What is happening now is because you have changed the story. Congratulations, Cucumber bro, you're stuck in a love triangle. And so is your brother."</span>
</p><p>
<span>After a long pause of several minutes in which Shen Yuan is unable to say anything and stares blankly at nothing, he finally manages to speak.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"So... Luo Binghe isn't straight?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"He never was, bro."</span>

<p>
<span>No one noticed Shen Yuan's existential crisis.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>A week after his rescue, Shen Jiu finally returns to Qian Cao Peak.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before fleeing from the other world, Shen Jiu wanted to alleviate the misery of the </span>
<em>
<span>thing</span>
</em>
<span>. To his surprise, they had already rescued him in a sudden burst of optimism. He didn't know how to feel about it, so Shen Jiu took all those feelings and locked them deep inside his chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Once at Qian Cao Peak, Shen Jiu takes a deep breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>During that time, Mu Qingfang has prohibited visits. The state of the </span>
<em>
<span>thing </span>
</em>
<span>was terrible, physically and mentally. At the daily meetings of the Peak Lords where they discussed the threat from the other world, he kept them informed about the progress. It took Mu Qingfang days for the </span>
<em>
<span>thing </span>
</em>
<span>to wake up from his catatonic state. In addition to the severe mutilations, the </span>
<em>
<span>thing </span>
</em>
<span>is malnourished, his wounds are infected, and his body is mangled inside and out from torture. His mental state is just as deplorable, as the </span>
<em>
<span>thing </span>
</em>
<span>hardly reacts and spends days trapped in a deep sleep, almost unconscious.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But today the </span>
<em>
<span>thing </span>
</em>
<span>is awake and Shen Jiu can no longer postpone the inevitable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ning Yingying is also at Qian Cao Peak. When Luo Binghe and Liu Qingge informed him of the rescue of the </span>
<em>
<span>thing</span>
</em>
<span>, Shen Jiu looked at his former disciple. And he also offered her the chance to escape from this hostile and twisted world, in which she wasn’t happy and would be in danger once Luo Bing-ge discovered the truth. Even though his invitation was extended to join Qing Jing Peak, Ning Yingying had refused the proposal. Instead, she decided to stay on Qian Cao Peak, accompanying the </span>
<em>
<span>thing</span>
</em>
<span>. Shen Jiu allowed it, as Mu Qingfang could also help her just like he healed him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ning Yingying smiles at him as Shen Jiu walks in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Good morning Shizun!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Even though the two of them were never really Master and Disciple, she insists on calling him that. And he allows her with a slight smile. Fear still dulls her eyes, but it seems to him that she is more lively. Although Shen Jiu would rather stay with her and talk about how she is doing, he sighs before heading to the room where the </span>
<em>
<span>thing </span>
</em>
<span>is. His footsteps lose determination without stopping. The room that Mu Qingfang has prepared is far away from other patients and onlookers. Despite the cleanliness and the medicinal plants that sweeten the environment, Shen Jiu still notices that stink of rot when he enters. It's a phantom smell that seems to come from inside his lungs. The cold of the cell is also trapped under his skin and makes him shiver.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sitting on a bed, covered by white inner robes that hide his stumps, rests... </span>
<em>
<span>Shen Qingqiu</span>
</em>
<span>.The one he could have been, his miserable other self in an alternate dimension.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu closes the door with stiff fingers. Turning around, he intentionally avoids the other's gaze. Shen Qingqiu only has one eye, but it is open and watching him tensely. His distrust is rough and aggressive, Shen Jiu notices it in the air. Even though he can't speak, his silence is loud. Shen Jiu can recognize in it his questions and all those scathing words that are doomed to get stuck in his throat. Almost better this way. Shen Jiu is not ready to argue with someone as stubborn and proud as he is.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Mu Qingfang has informed me that you are getting better." He says as he sits away from the bed, where he can look at him feeling safe. "Although our shidi suspects that for the first few days you acted as if you believed this to be a dream. Or an illusion. Well, I have news for you: it is real."</span>
</p><p>
<span>The other narrows his eye, still suspicious.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You are in another world. I know it's hard to believe, but I hope you appreciate my explanation because it's preferable to be kidnapped by an arrogant demon." Shen Jiu snorts. "Is that damned sword’s fault… We still haven't figured out why there are two worlds. The important thing is that there are certain differences that you may have already noticed. You're perceptive enough to have found a dozen differences already, am I wrong?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>And his other self finally reacts by raising an eyebrow, as if insinuating that he has found even more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Good. As I have discovered, in this world we are a few years behind in yours. It is not a great world, don’t be fooled by the contrast. It is miserable, unfair, and cruel." Shen Jiu stops, examining the other's expression. "You know what I'm talking about. From what I've gathered, our pasts were identical."</span>
</p><p>
<span>There is something that he hasn’t told anyone: Shen Jiu knows the reason that it has divided both worlds despite coming from the same origin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Still, I have to admit that this is a decent world compared to yours. And I want it to stay that way." Shen Jiu sits up. Despite his intentions, he doesn’t approach Shen Qingqiu but walks towards the window. "The future is uncertain. That Luo Bing-ge will not give up, not after how we have challenged him. But you don’t have to worry: we will protect you. With some conditions, obviously."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu finally turns to him. Despite the security with which he has disguised himself, he notices a lump in his chest. With Shen Yuan it was easier, as he soon assumed that he was a different person with the same appearance. But he is Shen Qingqiu. They are the same but different.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Shen Jiu would never trust himself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"First, you must help us with your knowledge to prevent the catastrophic events that have destroyed your world." Shen Jiu snorts when the other looks at him wryly. "Don't be childish, you have other ways of communicating. And don't worry. We are looking for a way to put your body back together. It will probably take a couple of years and I don't have that much patience, so use our intelligence to think of alternatives. Second... "</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu narrows his eyes. He has not forgotten anything that he heard in the other world.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Do you remember the mission of the well?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu looks annoyed but ends up reluctantly nodding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Do you remember what happened with Shang Qinghua and Liu Qingge?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>After hearing the last name, his expression darkens. Shen Jiu already knows what happened even before he frowns. Even though he also protected Liu Qingge, Luo Bing-ge's wives ensured that he became his killer. Of course, Shen Jiu doesn't trust them either.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"How did Liu Qingge die in your world?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>That question seems to stir up terrible memories. Shen Qingqiu no longer reacts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Perhaps it happened during a qi deviation?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu breaks his absent state to look at him with a mixture of surprise and anxiety. Shen Jiu hums thoughtfully. Thanks to Shen Yuan, he has enough pieces to solve that puzzle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We are both susceptible to qi deviations. Perhaps you killed him unconsciously, or perhaps the qi deviation itself consumed our shidi. When you get your tongue back, I want you to explain to me exactly what happened." Shen Jiu walks to a stop in front of the bed, looking down at the other. "Liu Qingge is alive here. If you pose a threat to his life, I don't care if we're the same person: I'll kill you, understand?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu meets his gaze defiantly. It's a good sign that he's getting his pride back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Those are my main conditions. If you agree, then nod. Otherwise, I will return you to Luo Bing-ge in exchange for leaving our world in peace."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Everyone would probably oppose that decision. But Shen Jiu knows that Shen Qingqiu has his own pessimism and that pathological insecurity that makes him consider himself worthless. Despite his furious look, the other nods. Because the two are also born survivors and will take advantage of any opportunity, however toxic and destructive it may be.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Neither of them hesitated to accept Wu Yanzi.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Shen Jiu and the world he is offering him are infinitely better than that rogue cultivator.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Great." Shen Jiu opens his fan, hiding a satisfied smile. "Now that we have agreed, allow me to give you some directives about your new situation. We have a brother."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu bit his lip.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I’m not talking about Qi-ge."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu's one eye widens.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I'm not going to share my brother. Next." Shen Jiu ignores the other's attempts to claim his attention to keep talking about Shen Yuan. "You are here because of the inexplicable optimism of Liu Qingge and Luo Binghe. Liu Qingge is the second best thing that has happened to me in this life. After my brother." Shen Qingqiu lets out a gasp, furious that he is ignoring him. "And Luo Binghe... is a particular case. He's not like yours. I'd rather say he's like us."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu fans himself slowly. It's easy to assume his fondness for Shen Yuan or his growing feelings for Liu Qingge, but Luo Binghe is more complicated. Especially now that he knows what he can do. And explaining it to Shen Qingqiu would be difficult given his experience. Shen Jiu still remembers that warped grudge of jealousy he felt for the stupid Liu Qingge and finds it hard to imagine how much the other has suffered at the hands of Luo Binghe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Despite this instinct to be defensive against Shen Qingqiu, Shen Jiu sighs and lowers the fan, closing it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don't worry about them. They'll be with me and my brother." The other stares at him again and he again ignores his hints. "My relationship with our sectmates is good. Liu Mingyan is a nice young lady here, Huan Hua Palace will never be a threat to us anymore, and Sha Hualing has no romantic ties to Luo Binghe that would lead her to act like a beast protecting her territory."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu raises an eyebrow, intrigued by that nuance. However, Shen Jiu refuses to explain what kind of dark interest Luo Bing-ge had in him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It's better if he doesn't know.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu doesn't want to give him any more nightmares.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your Yingying has accompanied you, although you already know that. Until we heal you, you will not leave Qian Cao Peak. Until we solve the problem with the other world, you will not leave the Cang Qiong Sect. Afterward, you are free to do whatever you wish with your life. Is there any doubt?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu has frowned sullenly. </span>
<em>
<span>Poor thing</span>
</em>
<span>, he thinks. </span>
<em>
<span>It will take you a while to have a fan to hide your emotions.</span>
</em>
<span> Shen Jiu has not forgotten his distrust and will only change his attitude when the other shows him that he is trustworthy. However, he decides to soften his aggressiveness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"My brother's name is Shen Yuan."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu tilts his head in interest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I found him. He is…" Shen Jiu sighs. "He has taught me many things. And he has also helped me improve my relationship with the rest."</span>
</p><p>
<span>The other blinks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No. I'm not going to introduce him to you."</span>
</p><p>
<span>He pouts again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I'm not overprotective! Do you remember how we took care of Qi-Ge in the streets? Well, Shen Yuan is just as naive and you are a bastard with blood on your hands. Leaving you two alone is out of the question."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu gives him a muffled growl that perhaps means "I don't have hands" or perhaps "you too".</span>

<p>
<span>Discovering the love plot has been more shocking for Shen Yuan than all his deaths. The love triangle is no surprise, after all, this started as a harem book. The problem is that the harem is wrongly focused! Luo Binghe is the harem master! And Shen Yuan will always support his disciple, even if he decides to conquer all the attractive men (which are not few) in this world. But… since when is Shen Jiu the one with so many romantic interests? And why are those same romantic interests interested in him too?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Well, Shen Yuan acknowledges that their attention is nice. But he is straight. So, he removes himself from the equation. Now he must fix this absurd mess.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re the fucking writer.” He growls once at An Ding Peak. In front of him, Shang Qinghua is gobbling up melon seeds like popcorn. "How do I fix this mess?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It's not a mess if it's fun..." Shang Qinghua clears his throat as Shen Yuan glares at him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"From 1 to 10, how likely is it that Liu-shidi will stop persecuting my brother and acknowledge Luo Binghe as the only harem master?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Although I'm pretty invested in the enemies to lovers trope and hatesex, Liu Qingge's loyalty is like steel. Could my son and the War God tangle some night? Maybe. Will they forget Jiu bro? Never."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yun whimpers as he rubs the bridge of his nose.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Why has the plot deviated so much!?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You are the reason the plot has deviated."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"... shut up."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shang Qinghua shrugs, grabbing another handful of melon seeds, while Shen Yuan ponders different possibilities with his arms crossed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"The best way to resolve the love triangle is for Jiu-ge to choose one of them. Fortunately, the answer is simple."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh, I hear you!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Luo Binghe, obviously! He's the protagonist for a good reason! There's no one more attractive than him or more powerful than him. He already has a castle! Oh gosh, can you imagine living in a castle with servants? And the food!" In other circumstances, Shen Yuan would have hidden behind a fan so as not to lose his cool, but the magic of Shang Qinghua is that he can act like the true millennial that he is with him. "The fantasy of having Luo Binghe cooking for you every day!? Gosh, as his brother-in-law, I will also be able to enjoy his food!! See? The answer is simple. If I had to choose.. ."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Well, technically... You can too..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"...I would choose Luo Binghe. And since Shen Jiu is smarter than me, he will too." Shen Yuan concludes with satisfaction.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan also considers himself to be smarter than average. Not an achievement to be proud of in a world where the IQ of the characters is lowered by the interest of the author. But, sometimes it is useful to solve these kinds of complications since the others don't.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He is fanning himself proudly when… he realizes something.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Well, I have to admit that Liu-shidi is also attractive. Now I understand why you killed him in the novel (and I'm still angry): he is probably the only one capable of rivaling Luo Binghe. And Liu-shidi is so attentive! The best uber in this world. Five stars, highly recommended." Shen Yuan bites his lip. "His cooking is delicious too. I wouldn't mind having him as a brother-in-law either, honestly. He is pretty, loyal, a good fighter, and cooks… Fuck. They're tied!" Shen Yuan covers his face with his hands, stifling a scream. "Damn excuse of author! Why are all your male leads so perfect?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You know? I'm surprised you still haven't considered the possibility of a Shen brother for each of them..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Impossible. I wouldn't mind, you know? They're both very caring and it would be wonderful to have a partner to protect me from this fucking world were even flowers want to kill you. And I can't spend my whole life living with Jiu-ge, especially when he gets married to any of them. Honestly, I always thought that Bai Zhan Peak is the coolest peak and a castle would also be formidable." He sighs. "But I'm straight. It wouldn't be fair to either of them."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Despite exposing his arguments, Shang Qinghua continues to eat his melon seeds with a mocking smile. Why does he want friends if they don't support him? Shen Yuan snorts and reaches out to grab a handful of melon seeds just for the sheer joy of teasing him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Now that I remember..." Shen Yuan murmurs with a thoughtful look. "There was a subplot. With Madame Meiyin."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Have you met the clairvoyant yet? And you didn't tell me, Cucumber bro!?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I had completely forgotten about it." He acknowledges, shrugging. "The point is, she made a prediction. A very vague prediction. About a destined one. I didn't give it any importance because I assumed she was talking about some woman... who would end up in Luo Binghe's harem. But now I think it could mean both Luo Binghe and Liu Qingge." Shen Yuan points his fan at Shang Qinghua, startling him. "You are the damn author of this world. Answer me a question about your worldbuilding. She said she was predicting my future, but she was reading Jiu-ge's body. Who was she really referring to? And who is my brother's soulmate?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>It is the best way to solve this dilemma. Shen Yuan will support any outcome. In any case, there is now another Shen Qingqiu, so both Luo Binghe and Liu Qingge can get the perfect and happy ending that they are looking for.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Well..." Although Shang Qinghua is not known for his determination, at that moment he is more indecisive than usual. "I never valued the possibility that someone real would end up in my world. But let's face it: Madame Meiyin is like a horoscope."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"That's not what you wrote!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What I'm trying to say is that she was vague because her ability is limited. Perhaps she was referring to both Liu Qingge and my son. Or perhaps she was talking about two destined ones because she sensed the future of the two of you!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh!" Shen Yuan doesn’t expect such an answer. And his heart decides to defy common sense by beating faster. "Then, what is the answer?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Did I tell you that it's probably the System's job to get the story closer to my original idea? Well... There never was a harem. But the harem..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I know, I know... It fed you." He snorts, still disappointed to discover the bitter reality of the life of a content creator. "Then?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"My intention was for my son to find out the truth about Jiu bro. Circles of abuse, remember? As a good protagonist, Luo Binghe would destroy it... But certain readers" Shang Qinghua gives him a meaningful look, "didn't like that his hated villain was a gray character. And that would mean that Luo Binghe had cruelly and unfairly tortured a person who didn't deserve it! My editors forbade me..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>At times, Shang Qinghua seems like a grandfather recounting his war stories. With a gesture, Shen Yuan motions for him to summarize.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What I mean, is that Luo Binghe and Shen Jiu have always been destined. They are... the cruelest definition of soulmates. Similar backstory, the possibility of healing or destroying each other. Jiu bro's petty attitude made Luo Binghe return his hatred a hundredfold. And so Shen Qingqiu ended as it began: miserably, tortured, being someone else's possession." Shang Qinghua pauses. "But an act of caring makes Luo Binghe return that same love a hundredfold. And more importantly, blind loyalty, the quality that Jiu-ge appreciates the most."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You're a bastard."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan fiddles with the melon seeds, not understanding why that answer has left him scrambled inside. This time it is no surprise after discovering that there are details of the book that he never understood. For years, Shen Yuan has lived under a name that is not his own, imitating a person he initially hated. He never wanted to be reincarnated in a book and even less so with his memories. In the end, it is exhausting to be trapped in a body that at first didn't belong to him, nor his way of combing his hair, nor his clothes, nor his hobbies. At least he had the consolation of a room to claim as his own. But the truth is that he has been trapped living in Shen Jiu's shadow for too long. And he misses his past life! Because of his family and friends, because of the internet, the stories he couldn't read, the games... and because it was entirely his.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It's stupid, but he's disheartened to discover that even his fate doesn't belong to him. He has none. Neither a soulmate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don't make that face, Cucumber bro!" Shang Qinghua exclaims upon noticing his gloomy mood from him. "If Jiu bro and my son are destined, that means Liu Qingge is yours."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"How?" He growls without hiding his bitterness. "I'm not supposed to exist!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Exactly! At this point in the plot, Liu Qingge doesn’t exist either!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan's eyes widen. And he stares at the author.</span>
</p><p>

<span>"Liu Qingge was going to die. Liu Qingge WAS destined to die. But you saved him. In the book, neither of you exists. But you changed that!! Your existence affects Liu Qingge's. That's the definition of a soulmate, Cucumber bro."</span>
</p><p>
<span>After a few long minutes with a blank mind and an open mouth, Shen Yuan finally reacted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh." He clears his throat, trying to regain his immortal aloof image. "Too bad that I'm straight."</span>

<p>
<span>According to Shang Qinghua's definition, a soulmate can also be a friend. And that is the reason why Shen Yuan decides to visit Bai Zhan Peak that morning: he misses his friend. Besides, he's pretty bored too. Shen Jiu is throwing himself into the recovery of the other Shen Qingqiu together with Mu Qingfang. And he has nothing to do. The disciples are no longer children who need his help, he is also not allowed to leave the sect until the problem with the other world is solved. Shen Yuan has been reunited with his cat and has caught up after almost two years of absence. Not even Gongyi Xiao has anything interesting to tell him!</span>
</p><p>
<span>Well, if his brother has decided to leave him in boredom, Shen Yuan will visit his good </span>
<em>
<span>friend </span>
</em>
<span>Liu Qingge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As usual, Liu Qingge is beating his disciples. What is not so common anymore is the fact that today he is teaching them. Liu Qingge's lessons are usually silent, except for screams and groans of pain. However, Shen Yuan appreciates that he is giving them directions. Maybe they are crude and composed of monosyllables, but it is progress. Shen Yuan trembles unconsciously, as he knows that the only reason Liu Qingge is exerting himself is to prepare his disciples for a possible attack.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>How cute</span>
</em>
<span>, he thinks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, Shen Yuan slaps his cheek.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan forgets his stealth as he approaches the training ground. He walks carefully so as not to stain his clothes with the dust floating in the air. His presence does not go unnoticed. Instantly, everyone turns to him, and Liu Qingge stops what he was doing to approach him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Is something wrong?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No." Shen Yuan's smile makes Liu Qingge soften his scowl. "I just wanted to visit Liu-shidi."</span>
</p><p>
<span>A slight blush stains his cheeks. </span>
<em>
<span>That's illegally cute! </span>
</em>
<span>Shen Yuan has to control himself not to slap his cheek again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mn.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge turns around, making a vague gesture that perhaps points to his home or perhaps to the training ground. He also seems confused about his intentions, merely making it clear to Shen Yuan that he is invited to the entirety of Bai Zhan Peak. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan raises his fan to hide a mischievous smile when…</span>
<em>
<span>Fuck! Why did I take the fan he gave me!?</span>
</em>
<span> He hadn't even noticed. After all, it’s one of his favorite fans. </span>
<em>
<span>What if Liu Qingge notices? Will he jump to conclusions? I don't want to give him false hope! </span>
</em>
<span>Overwhelmed, Shen Yuan hides the fan up his sleeve when Liu Qingge doesn't look.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Liu-shidi, Liu-shidi..." He stammers, unable to control those nerves that are like an army of ants under his skin. "I was wondering... Do you think Jiu-ge would let me visit the city if you come with me? I know it's dangerous, but Liu-shidi is strong and..."</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Fuck.</span>
</em>
<span> Just the two of them... </span>
<em>
<span>That sounds like a date! What if he thinks I'm asking him out? Retreat! Retreat!</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>"No, that’s a terrible idea." Shen Yuan anticipates Liu Qingge's possible response by shaking his head and crossing his arms. "How could this have crossed my mind? It's so foolish..." As he sputters, Liu Qingge looks at him in confusion. "Well, Liu-shidi, since I'm here, how about having tea..."</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>In his house? ALONE! What are you thinking about? Retreat! Retreat!</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>"...While we watch your disciples? Yes! That's an excellent idea!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Shen Yuan steps forward with impatient steps to create distance between them. </span>
<em>
<span>Being straight in PIDW shouldn't be that hard!</span>
</em>
<span> He protests to himself. Next time, he will hit Shang Qinghua a hundred times for making his characters so dangerously attractive. Everything would be easier if the others had flaws. But Liu Qingge, so loyal and dedicated, is just perfect. Then there is Luo Binghe. Objectively, Shen Yuan knows that he has a dark history that might have been even darker under other circumstances.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He is also aware that he started reading </span>
<em>
<span>Proud Immortal Demon Way </span>
</em>
<span>because he is into it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge doesn't object to the idea of Shen Yuan drinking tea while he continues to train his disciples. From time to time, he gives him curious glances that meet Shen Yuan's gaze, making him blush. (That's normal too! What should he do? Look at the scenery? He has come to visit his friend!) Even though Shen Yuan pretends to be lost in his thoughts as he drains an empty cup, Liu Qingge continues to act normal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Until one of the disciples manages to grab him by the outer robes. It is an unsuccessful attack that ends with the young man on the other side of the peak, but his clothes are loose, revealing his collarbones.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The collarbones are normal. Everyone has collarbones! Shen Yuan's nervousness is related to the puritanism of this era and nothing more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With an annoyed snort, Liu Qingge takes off his outer robes. He is so sweaty that his clothes cling to his perfectly defined muscles and... </span>
<em>
<span>ENOUGH!!!!</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan drops the cup of tea from his hands. When Liu Qingge looks at him, puzzled, he clears his throat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I think I should go back." He sputters, averting his gaze to ignore the spectacle of the War God's beauty. "I have..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>The oven on? The gas open? Why are there no good excuses in this era? Shen Yuan forces himself to walk, knowing that once he reaches Rainbow Bridge he will run. Maybe to Qing Jing Peak, maybe to An Ding Peak, or to a river to jump into. His head is blank with the only thought of escaping. But his legs are like jelly. And his body doesn't respond. Shen Yuan falls to the ground as if he has suffered from heatstroke. Or worse: a stupid and timely wife plot.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Fuck Airplane Towards the Sky!!!!</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>At least he is nearly unconscious when Liu Qingge catches him in his arms, preventing him from falling. Those muscular arms take him gracefully and he ends up with his face resting against his chest. Now Shen Yuan can't escape his warmth and scent.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Liu-shidi... your beauty has defeated me..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>His only luck that day is that Shen Yuan finally loses consciousness.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu raises an eyebrow when he sees Luo Binghe in the gardens of Qian Cao Peak. His former disciple recognizes him too, giving him an open smile (but not as bright and sincere as when he's with Liu Qingge (and Shen Jiu isn't stupid, he knows it's a ruse, but something inside him twists (there has been always jealousy in his heart))). His pride prevents him from losing whatever the demon's game is, so he gives him a blank expression. No smiles, no anger. Luo Binghe doesn't deserve the right to his emotions.</span>
</p><p>
<span>(Except that darkness digging its nails into his bones.)</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What brings you here, Luo Binghe?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This disciple has come intending to fulfill his promise." And he adds after Shen Jiu nods curiously. "Shizun asked me to remove my blood."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"And you did it."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yes. But there is another shizun."</span>
</p><p>
<span>The two know who is inside the wooden house, although neither mentions his name. The fact that Luo Binghe comments on it without attaching special importance to his other self softens those dark feelings. (Shen Jiu hasn't sunk so low as to be envious of himself yet)</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Good." He acknowledges it with a nod. It is positive that Luo Binghe made that decision without being forced by him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>However, the demon shakes his head sadly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I couldn't, shizun. I haven't even managed to get in. The other shizun has panicked after listening to me and Mu-shishu has decided that it's not the best time."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"That's true.” He sighs. “I'll talk to him to get his permission. Maybe it'll be easier if he's asleep."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu knows that his other self also hates having demon blood inside his body.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This one leaves, shizun." Luo Binghe bows his head towards him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu frowns with a hunch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Are you leaving the sect?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Mobei-jun has warned me that there are problems in the Demon Realm."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu snorts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I told you many times that you have too many open fronts." He scolds his disciple. "Did you forget about the rebellion in the south when you came here?" And his eyes widen as he guesses what happened. "You didn't forget it: you abandoned it. Luo Binghe! I will never allow any disciple of mine to be so stupid! And you want to rule? Leave that stupid palace and do what you're really good at."</span>
</p><p>
<span>He walks away from the demon to enter the house with impatient steps, not even waiting to hear Luo Binghe's answer. But his fury is not entirely real. After so many years affected by the resentment that he was worthless, that Qi-ge abandoned him, that everyone else preferred Shen Yuan, it is comforting that someone leaves everything for him. </span>
<em>
<span>So idiot</span>
</em>
<span>, he thinks, remembering the unexpected appearance of Luo Binghe and Liu Qingge in the other world.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His mood is excellent when he enters Shen Qingqiu's room. The appearance of his other self is still haggard, although there is a determined gleam in his eyes. The </span>
<em>
<span>thing </span>
</em>
<span>has decided to live and become a person again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Your Yingying sent me your report about the other world." He says instead of greeting him as he sits at the visitor's table. "Nice job despite your limitations. I knew you could." He pauses during which his other self looks at him suspiciously. "Though it's useless. I had already found out all that information."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu's face twitches. </span>
<em>
<span>I also make that ugly face when I get angry?</span>
</em>
<span> Shen Jiu ponders as he taps his fingers on the table.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don't look at me like that. You should have guessed."</span>
</p><p>
<span>This time, it's a bit unfair since Shen Jiu has all the secrets that Shen Yuan once wrote. But thanks to this task he has confirmed that the other world is the one his brother predicted and that Shen Qingqiu has not tried to deceive him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Good news for you: I know what you have written is true. But I need more."</span>
</p><p>
<span>His other self wrinkles his nose before shaking his head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You don't want to or you don't know anything else? Be careful with your answer: being stubborn is not the same as being expendable."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now he is looking at him with a hatred so intense that anyone else would be scared. Then, he raises his head proudly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh? As I imagined, you know more things."</span>
</p><p>
<span>He nods.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shall I call Ning Yingying?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>He refuses tilting his head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"So you've decided to be stubborn."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu shrugs vaguely before turning to the window. It is not a gesture of evasion or to avoid him, he is trying to show him what is outside the window with his gaze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Am I to assume you want something in return?" Another nod. "Go back to Qing Jing Peak?" Negative. "Something from outside?" An intermediate gesture. "Someone?" Affirmation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu frowns.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His thoughts are not difficult to guess.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I will not leave you with my brother until I confirm that you aren’t a threat."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu, who has neither arms nor legs, not even a tongue to defend himself with, gives him a skeptical expression.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Which becomes one of uncertainty.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s wrong?” Shen Jiu frowns, confused.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His other self lets out a muffled groan, as inexplicable as the tension wracking his battered body. Shen Jiu sits up. And then he notices something cold on his wrist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Looking down, Shen Jiu discovers a tiny green snake wrapped around his wrist like a bracelet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The snake bites him, faster than his reflexes. It is too late when Shen Jiu uses his qi to get rid of the reptile. The poison spreads through his limbs, stunning him and causing him to stumble. He is dizzy and sleepy. Some hands grab him by his shoulders, holding him up so he doesn't collapse. Although Shen Jiu cannot see them, his instinct knows that they are not anyone he knows. Perhaps an enemy with cold skin and scales on his fingers. In front of them, Shen Qingqiu is pale and his eye dilated with fear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Hmmm. Another Master Shen?" Says the stranger. "How unexpected."</span>

<p>
<span>Chaos had engulfed Qian Cao Peak when they discovered that both Shen Jiu and Shen Qingqiu from the other world had disappeared. The Peak Lords and their head disciples were arguing among themselves, entangled in the same contagious fear, while Luo Binghe stood back in a corner. Thanks to Mobei-jun's ability to travel through the shadows, he had returned to the sect to discover the news that managed to crush his heart under the weight of panic. But instead of intervening, he stood silent with his arms folded, weighing all the possibilities with the clues he possessed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Soon after, Liu Qingge lands on Qian Cao Peak with brutality capable of tearing apart Mu Qingfang's gardens. But nobody scolds him, because the War God carries in his arms the pale and inert body of Shen Yuan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe frowns even deeper.</span>
</p><p>
<span>According to Mu Qingfang's diagnosis, Shen Yuan is dead, though he doesn't understand why. Luo Binghe listens, still distant from the others, as he begins to figure out what has happened. The demon clenches his fists, furious but also restless since everything indicates that his other self is more powerful than they had imagined.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After being satisfied with the image he has deduced from the clues, the demon finally moves. He walks without making noise or disturbing others. His gaze meets Liu Qingge’s, who is also tense listening to Mu Qingfang's theories. With a gesture, Luo Binghe motions for him to follow him outside. And this time, the cultivator does not ignore or challenge him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The two meet in the garden, away from the restlessness of the rest and their prying ears.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Liu Qingge growls.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Demon blood." Liu Qingge's eyes widen as he understands what he means. Luo Binghe crosses his arms before continuing to speak. "I can't track Shizun anymore... Shen Jiu." This time, it is better to say their names to avoid misunderstandings, even though the demon feels his tongue burning for being disrespectful. "But I notice my blood on Shen Qingqiu's body. He is in the southern Demon Realm. And perhaps, Shen Jiu is with him."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge nods.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Do you think it was the other Luo Binghe's thing?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Not sure. The south has been defying me for many years. Perhaps they have captured shizun to blackmail me. Besides," Luo Binghe lets out a bitter voice. "I'm pretty sure the other me would have fed Shen Jiu with our blood again and taken the two of them to his palace, not some lost place in the south."</span>
</p><p>
<span>After all, that's what he did. Luo Binghe clenches his fists tightly to hide his contempt for himself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"But this is not all." The demon continues. "I can feel my blood on Shen Yuan's original body. He has awakened."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"How? He wasn't dead?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I had left because I was warned that some rebels were attacking the palace. But I was already late: someone has stolen Shen Yuan's body and now he has been awakened in the Demons' Holy Mausoleum."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"That's why this body is dead." Liu Qingge understands. "His soul has returned to the original body."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Effectively." Luo Binghe takes a deep breath. “The Demons' Holy Mausoleum is a special place, not just anyone can enter. That means that my enemies in the south are more powerful than I had imagined or it is someone else.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge frowns, guessing without words who he means. Since the possibility of resurrecting Shen Yuan using the Demons' Holy Mausoleum was his other self's idea. Luo Binghe looks at his former rival. Deciding to summon him was easy, but now the words get stuck in his throat. Luo Binghe is not used to trusting anyone else, even for a while he also harbored dark and toxic doubts about his two shizuns. But this time his limitations stop him. Despite the repulsion of his pride, Luo Binghe is aware that alone he won’t be able to rescue all of them. And in a way, he trusts Liu Qingge and his honesty, that his feelings are strong enough to fight to the death to rescue the two brothers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Even so, it is difficult for him to arm himself with the necessary courage to open his mouth and propose an alliance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I can break into the Demons' Holy Mausoleum." Luo Binghe growls, shattering his pride to pieces with a few words. "And I can tell you where Shen Jiu and Shen Qingqiu are located in the Demon Realm."</span>
</p><p>
<span>The alliance is so unexpected that Liu Qingge looks at him in confusion without saying anything or reacting. Luo Binghe also can't believe that he finally said it. The temptation to use Xin Mo creeps up his right hand in a tingle that will only disappear when he grasps the hilt of the sword to traverse impossible distances in seconds and then annihilate his enemies. He forces himself to take a deep breath to push those thoughts away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Can I trust you or not, Liu-shishu?" He hisses.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>When Shen Jiu wakes up, he is a little dizzy and his wrist is sore from where the snake bit him. But soon he clears his head and his thoughts flow freely. Shen Jiu sits up. He is lying on a simple bed inside what looks like a tent. And from the noise outside, the cultivator deduces that he is in a war camp. </span>
<em>
<span>At least there hasn't been any Luo Binghe this time.</span>
</em>
<span> That doesn't stop him from still being furious.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu determinedly gets out of bed and leaves the tent. Whoever kidnapped him made the mistake of not chaining him up or nullifying his abilities. He can even access Xiu Ya! It's easy to corner a random demon to demand answers. And so, less than a few minutes after he woke up, Shen Jiu is entering the main tent of the camp to confront the daring demon lord. Even though no one announces his presence, as Shen Jiu is playing on the surprise factor, he is transfixed by two pairs of eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There is a demon and a human. The demon is graceful and his smile widens as he recognizes him. But it's not the demonic mark shining on his forehead that stuns Shen Jiu, but his eyes are identical to Luo Binghe's. And at that moment, it occurs to him that maybe he made a mistake by focusing on his disciple's future instead of his past. It was a lapse not to investigate the unexpected origin of a half-demon and now he has someone in front of him who is undoubtedly his relative.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The other is Shen Qingqiu. Who now has two eyes. One is red and watery, but it is real and now he is scrutinizing him with a gaze similar to that Shen Jiu would find in a mirror. The demon has healed him. His pitiful other self still has neither arms nor legs, but he has recovered his eye and from the blood staining his lips, Shen Jiu deduces that his tongue as well.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Who are you?" Shen Jiu decides to ignore Shen Qingqiu for the time being to focus on the kidnapper. "And what do you want?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>The demon curves his lips into a feline smile, with a touch of mischief.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This one's name is Tianlang-jun. It's really nice to finally meet you, Master Shen. I've heard a lot about you."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Both Shen Jiu and Shen Qingqiu frown in an identical gesture, as both of them also know that infamous name.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Under other circumstances, it might have been a pleasure, but not this time." Shen Jiu growls.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His response probably amused the demon, who laughs before indicating that he should sit with them. Reluctantly, Shen Jiu approaches. Despite the icy fury that pulses through his veins, he is more than curious to understand how an ancient legend has returned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You and your brother are quite famous. And interesting." Tianlang-jun comments as he picks up a pot of tea. The movement of his arms is strange as if they were going to fall off at any moment. "May I ask who is the third and how did he end up in this state?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"A distant relative." Shen Jiu comments, making Shen Qingqiu snorts. At least he still carries a fan. "Can I also ask you a few questions?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Of course!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Are we in the south of the Demon Realm?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Indeed."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu glares at the demon.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"So it's you who has been fighting my disciple all these years."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tianlang-jun lets out a thunderous laugh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"As smart as they say! Although it seems that my offspring isn’t very clever, at least he has you, Master Shen."</span>
</p><p>
<span>The revelation does not surprise him, since it fits with Luo Binghe's age and talent, yet it is a discovery that almost stuns Shen Jiu. Meanwhile, Shen Qingqiu seems to be silently digesting that information.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I have one last question." Shen Jiu stares at Tianlang-jun. "Perhaps a certain incident with some sowers is related to you."</span>
</p><p>
<span>The demon's smile is answer enough and that's what Shen Jiu needs to get up with his sword drawn and point at him. Tianlang-jun doesn't react. He rests his head against his fist as he watches him amused. Shen Qingqiu is also looking at them with curiosity in his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You planned to hurt my brother." Shen Jiu hisses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Not by a long shot, Master Shen. My nephew's intentions have always been to help you both."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Nephew?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I think it's the one with the snakes." Shen Qingqiu intervenes for the first time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although they are the same person, his voice sounds different, hoarse, and rough from disuse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Explain.” He orders the demon.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"The two of you took pity on my nephew in his time of need, allowing me to return. My Zhuzhi-lang is a good boy. Despite my intentions to destroy the cultivation world and annihilate all sects, he has interceded to save both of you."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You plan to do what!?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Though my interest in meeting you two is genuine." Tianlang-jun ignores both the sword pointed at him and Shen Jiu. "Especially to you, Master Shen. Your adventures are more interesting since your brother was dead for so long."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Can you explain to me again what you plan to do with my sect?" Shen Jiu hisses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Destroy it. It's nothing personal, I plan to destroy them all." The demon pauses. "Perhaps if it's personal, after all, it was the great sects that sealed me under a mountain. Can you please sit, Master Shen?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don’t." Shen Qingqiu intervenes. Between the lines, Shen Jiu listens: </span>
<em>
<span>Stay standing, at least you have legs.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>"I wasn’t going to do it."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"In that case, can you put the sword away? You can't sign with your hands full."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu narrows his eyes. Not only because the demon disdains his ability as only incredibly powerful beings can, but because he talks about destroying his world with indifference while he only thinks of his own interests. Interests that he still doesn’t know.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Sign what?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"A masterpiece. But first, can I ask you about the ending?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>That demon is crazy and only says absurd nonsense. Shen Jiu's head is beginning to ache just from trying to understand him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This master doesn't know what you're talking about."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Well, a logical ending would be for both my offspring and the War God to end up with an immortal master, but each book offers a different perspective. And my offspring already made it clear by kidnapping you both..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu chokes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu is livid and his thoughts have stopped working. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Meanwhile, Tianlang-jun keeps talking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Under other circumstances, I'd think my offspring would be able to crown his two masters as his empresses, but the War God is an excellent love rival. The rescue scene was very passionate indeed."</span>
</p><p>
<span>It's not Shen Jiu who bursts out hearing that, but Shen Qingqiu, who turns to him with a wild look.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What is he talking about?" He hisses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Nothing."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You despicable liar... Is that why the beast didn't lock you up with me? I couldn't believe it when Ning Yingying said that..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Your Luo Bing-ge is a madman who only talks nonsense." He cuts him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Do I have another child?" Tianlang-jun blinks, more amused than surprised.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don't listen to the demons." Shen Jiu continues. "They are liars."</span>
</p><p>
<span>However, Shen Qingqiu straightens up with his head held high to meet his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"In that case, you are the worst of demons."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Do you speak from experience?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Obviously."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Master Shen, can you put down that sword? It took me a long time to heal your distant relative and I need you to sign the books."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu pales, and Shen Qingqiu narrows his eyes suspiciously.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What books?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tianlang-jun preempts any excuse, pulling out five books from his sleeve, which he places on the table.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"The last one surprised me. I never imagined the possibility that the two suitors would become entangled in a passionate hate relationship." He hums happily. "I am very grateful to the author because they have made it worthwhile to return."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead, Shen Jiu is grateful that his other self has no arms to pick up those books since the desire burns in his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"That's fiction." He snorts without hiding his disgust. "None of it is real."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Someone wrote a book about you with the beast and our brute shidi?" Shen Qingqiu lets out an acid but heartfelt laugh. "From what I see, your life is still pathetic in this world. What a relief. I already believe that what you told me was not true."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu hesitates whether to hit him with the fan or the sword. However, Tianlang-jun clicks his tongue and shakes his head like a calamity before destroying the world.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don't try to belittle me, master Shen. I heard that my offspring attacked the Cang Qiong Mountain Sect, causing your brother's death. Then, he took the two of you to his human palace. Too bad he beat me to it by conquering the Huan Hua Palace." Tianlang-jun sighs. "All the War God's attempts to rescue you were also famous. How long were you locked up? A year?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I wasn't locked up!" Shen Jiu hisses. "I was a guest while I waited for my brother to return!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yeah, sure. Perhaps a guest in his rooms?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu has paled even more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Obviously not!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It was very exciting when the War God rescued you."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"How lucky." Shen Qingqiu grunts through clenched teeth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And very romantic, I must say. According to rumors, Master Shen was so weak from my offspring's mistreatment that he had to carry you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nevermind. You’re pathetic.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Enough!" Shen Jiu plunges the sword into the table, startling the two of them. “Don't twist the truth!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It is a known fact to all that Master Shen was wandering for a year while his two lovers pursued him."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You're not even remotely close to the truth."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Despite his anger, Tianlang-jun's smile doesn’t fade or diminish. The demon even has the nerve to hold out the books to him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Can you sign them?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>The demon then protects them with his dark qi when Shen Jiu tries to destroy them. That makes his arm fall off, but he instantly snaps it back on. Shen Qingqiu looks at him enviously before turning to Shen Jiu.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Now I understand why they came back for you."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"As I am tired of repeating, the demon only talks nonsense and those books have been written by someone else based on isolated facts."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You can't fool me." Shen Qingqiu hisses. "Although I'm still surprised that someone is capable of taking an interest in you... WHY LIU QINGGE?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don't jump to conclusions..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"YOU TOLD ME YOURSELF THAT IT WAS THE SECOND BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO YOU! I thought you were exaggerating, that maybe you were trying to confuse me or it was all a delusional dream of the beast. But Liu Qingge? That brainless brute?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don’t." Shen Jiu warns him with a hiss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Have you forgotten what happened at the well mission?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"He apologized, okay?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh? So you're a naive accepting apology? Have you forgiven Qi-ge too?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It’s different!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yes? And what about YOUR DISCIPLE LUO BINGHE? How did you end up between those two?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I don't know!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh? So you finally recognize that there is something?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu is trembling as he turns to Tianlang-jun, who watches his discussion without hiding his amusement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Can you remove his tongue again, please?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"He won't." Shen Qingqiu intervenes. Despite the confidence he appears, there is a fear deep in his eyes. "I can tell interesting things. For example, do you know that if you send certain legs to Cang Qiong Sect Leader he will fall into any trap no matter how stupid it is?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>It is a message for both of them. Shen Jiu still remembers that before they were kidnapped, he had asked him for new information. And his eyes widen in horror as he understands everything that those perverse words contain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It is also a threat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu has no ties to this world and he won't mind allying himself with the demon if he doesn't offer him something better. </span>
<em>
<span>I hate myself.</span>
</em>
<span> He groans before sitting up and looking Tianlang-jun into the eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don't listen to my cousin. The accident sometimes makes him delirious."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu clicks his tongue in disgust, and Shen Jiu gives him a warning look: </span>
<em>
<span>you are no longer a distant relative but my cousin. Don’t complain.</span>
</em>

<p>
<span>A snake demon greets Shen Yuan when he awakens inside a coffin. When the stranger, Zhuzhi-lang, explains how he ended up in the Demons' Holy Mausoleum (smiling too brightly despite kidnapping him), Shen Yuan feels an unexpected relief. Now he has an excuse to not look Liu Qingge in the face ever again. And next time, he will explain to him that all the nonsense he said was because his soul violently left his body.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He is a good brother, okay!? He is not going to unconsciously flirt with his possible future brother-in-law!</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, the Demons' Holy Mausoleum shakes and one of the walls breaks as Luo Binghe appears with a pack of Moon Python Rhinoceros. It's... quite heroic. Perhaps his heart races as he smiles like a silly maiden. Unfortunately, Zhuzhi-lang turns into a snake and swallows Shen Yuan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That is not pleasant, but gross and dirty.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The next time, Shen Yuan wakes up to a much warmer and more comforting place that doesn't reek of snake breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"A-Yuan!" Someone exclaims. A hand helps him straighten up, and Shen Yuan recognizes first the smell of bamboo and then the worried expression on his brother's face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Jiu-ge...?" He sputters. "Have you been kidnapped again?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Again?” A third voice intervenes with disgust.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan, already awake, raises his head to find the original Shen Qingqiu looking at the two of them with a hard-to-read scowl. There is curiosity in his eyes, but also disgust and mistrust. He is sitting in front of a low table. His appearance has improved considerably since the last time Shen Yuan saw him. What was once almost a corpse has now regained some of his past glory and his lost eye.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You can talk." He stammers, surprised.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Evidently." Shen Qingqiu clicks his tongue. And although he doesn't say so, Shen Yuan suspects that he is assessing his intelligence and not positively. "So, we finally met. I was quite curious about your existence."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Well, he is Shen Yuan. I hope you are satisfied by now." Shen Jiu growls, clearly dissatisfied, before sitting up. "Now we're leaving. Hurry up."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What?" Shen Yuan splutters.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He's still a little dazed after so many emotions and he stumbles when his brother yanks him out of bed by his arm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What are you doing?" Shen Qingqiu looks just as confused as him. "You told Tianlang-jun that you would stay of your own free will."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I thought it would be pretty obvious to you that I was lying."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Wait! TIANLANG-JUN!!!?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Both ignore Shen Yuan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We're not leaving." Shen Qingqiu hisses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I only waited because he said that Shen Yuan had been caught as well. Now that he is with me, I have no reason to willingly become his prisoner.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>"He wants to destroy the sect."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Another good reason to leave and warn Yue Qingyuan."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Or we can stay. A good strategist must collect as much information as possible to devise the best plan."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"And why do you care? This is not your world."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu grits his teeth in anger. Although his expression is terrifying, his face is the same as Shen Jiu's and so Shen Yuan recognizes the fear lurking in the depths of his eyes. And sadness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"My sect was already destroyed once. I'd rather not live through it again."</span>
</p><p>
<span>That mention makes Shen Jiu tense. He clenches his fists tightly and his expression becomes more determined.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“According to what you have told me, Yue Qingyuan is in danger as long as we are prisoners.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh fuck.</span>
</em>
<span> Shen Yuan pales. </span>
<em>
<span>That bastard Shen Qingqiu! Why did you tell him!?</span>
</em>
<span> Taking advantage of the holes in the System, Shen Yuan had offered a lot of information to Shen Jiu, but he had also left out another. There was no need to traumatize him with the description of Luo Binghe's torture or Ming Fan's agonizing death eaten by ants or Yue Qingyuan… impaled by a thousand arrows after receiving his legs torn off as bait.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But it's as if fate is pushing Shen Jiu to discover all the dark secrets of the original book.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although Shen Qingqiu trembles imperceptibly, he still holds his head high and challenges Shen Jiu with his gaze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I will scream if you try to leave."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Filthy snake." Shen Jiu hisses, furious.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"But... I can keep quiet if you explain to me why you have a brother."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Suddenly, Shen Qingqiu's security seems more fragile. That's a ridiculous and selfish request compared to the seriousness they were discussing earlier, but it's important to him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu and Shen Yuan exchange a look.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It's a simple question with a complicated answer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I found him." Shen Jiu begins to speak in a hesitant voice. And Shen Yuan doesn't need more to know that he has chosen the half-truths. "I was already a Peak Lord when I met someone identical to me. Our meeting was not pleasant. He tried to steal my position..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"And you locked me up." Shen Yuan fights back. "Now that I think about it, that was almost a kidnapping."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Nevermind. Our relationship improved and the two of us worked together as Shen Qingqiu until Luo Binghe came back from the Abyss and everyone found out the secret. The end."</span>
</p><p>
<span>They share the same unease as they wait for Shen Qingqiu's reaction, who looks at them in amazement. Though his mouth is open, he doesn't say anything, and for a few seconds, silence hangs over them until it reaches every corner.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"And... that's all?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I can tell you more details once we're away." Shen Jiu reluctantly agrees. "Deal?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu nods.</span>
</p><p>
<span>However, all three are startled by footsteps. And an instant later, the cloth covering the entrance is parted and two demons enter. Shen Yuan already recognizes Zhuzhi-lang, so his gaze falls on the other. It is easy to recognize certain similarities of Luo Binghe in him, although Tianlang-jun is much stockier and his smile is brighter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh! How curious! Master Shen, your brother is identical to you and your cousin."</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Cousin?</span>
</em>
<span> Shen Yuan thinks in amusement before turning to Shen Jiu. His brother shrugs before heading towards the demon.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You're interrupting a family meeting. We'd appreciate it if you leave us alone."</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Jiu-ge, you can't talk like that to the most powerful Demon Lord before Binghe! </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>"You're so funny Master Shen! I must also thank your brother for helping my nephew." Beside Tianlang-jun, Zhuzhi-lang hangs his head in shame. The scales on his cheeks shine with a blush hue. "Besides, if Master Shen insists on not answering my questions, perhaps your brother can help me."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu tenses up suspiciously. Shen Qingqiu looks amused.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Shen Yuan is confused.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tianlang-jun walks in, followed by the snake demon, to sit down at the low table without waiting for forgiveness or permission. While Shen Qingqiu has no choice but to stay by the demons' side, his brother stays in front of Shen Yuan protectively.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Must this master remind you that our private lives are private?" He hisses. "Furthermore, A-Yuan is not interested in men."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan blinks in confusion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Forgive my insistence, Master Shen, but this old man is curious who his son-in-law will be. My offspring is a disappointment, but at least he has good taste. Also, the three of you are a great catch. If neither is interested in my son, you still have my nephew."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now Shen Yuan's cheeks burn with embarrassment. He is not surprised that Zhuzhi-lang seems so mortified and prefers to sit away from his uncle. Meanwhile, Shen Qingqiu and Shen Jiu are glaring at him with a dark and terrifying expression, which must have haunted little Bingbing's nightmares. Too bad that Tianlang-jun doesn't care.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They all notice powerful demonic energy outside at the same time. Despite the raging darkness that pollutes the air, Tianlang-jun's smile grows.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Well, he is finally here."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You wanted Binghe." Shen Yuan sputters. "That was a trap."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"More or less. I was sincere when I promised my nephew that I would prevent any Master Shen from harm when the cultivation world fell."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan holds his breath as Luo Binghe walks in. His shadow seems even more immense with fury. This space is too small to contain two heavenly demons, and despite the suffocating anguish, Shen Yuan smiles.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This is unexpected." Luo Binghe looks at everyone who is gathered until his gaze stops at his father. "Who are you and what are you doing with my shizuns?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu's hand is cold. Shen Yuan shivers unconsciously as his brother holds his wrist so tightly that it hurts. But Shen Yuan doesn't say anything. He has a feeling that he should keep quiet at the moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tianlang-jun looks with disinterest at his son with a less than friendly expression.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You are identical to her." In his mouth, that doesn't sound like a compliment. "Before we talk about certain matters, could you solve this old man's doubt? Which Master Shen do you prefer?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe lets out a laugh too bitter, too broken, to be friendly. And Shen Jiu squeezes his wrist so hard that Shen Yuan turns to him. All his complaints die in his throat when he discovers that his brother is deathly pale and with dilated pupils.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"All of them."</span>
</p><p>
<span>This Luo Binghe only carries one sword.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Xin Mo.</span>

<p>
<span>The tension is not only uncomfortable but terrifying. His brother is tense while Shen Qingqiu has turned pale. Zhuzhi-lang watches the newcomer warily, and Tianlang-jun's smile is less warm. All the eyes are fixed on a Luo Binghe very similar to the one Shen Yuan knows. There are hardly any differences in his physical appearance. He may be shorter and paler, but he has the same magnetic charm as his disciple. And irredeemable cruelty darkens his features.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Despite the fear, Shen Yuan gulps and pretends not to recognize the impostor. He is an avid reader! He can understand Luo Bing-ge better than his own! Shen Yuan squeezes Shen Jiu's hand to ask for confidence before welcoming the demon with a smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although Shen Jiu holds his hand tightly, he doesn't say anything.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Hi, Luo Binghe. You have arrived on time." Shen Yuan's pulse quickens as the demon turns to him, gazing at him like a predator would at his prey. "Let this master introduce you: he is Tianlang-jun, your father."</span>
</p><p>
<span>A new curiosity flashes across his face. After all, what protagonist would pass up that opportunity to discover his origins? Luo Bing-ge not at least. Shen Yuan is still trying hard to feign normalcy as he drags Shen Jiu along with the demons. Perhaps the tendency to kidnap is a family trait, but he trusts Zhuzhi-lang's moral code. The demon snake seems the least prone to ripping off limbs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We were discussing some interesting matters before you arrived." Shen Yuan keeps talking as he thinks of different ideas to draw the attention of the blackened protagonist away from his family. "Sit, Luo Binghe. I think you and your father have a lot to talk about."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don't get me wrong, Second Master Shen." Tianlang-jun intervenes. "This boy of mine and I only had two matters to discuss and he has already answered my first question."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Relating to our previous conversation." To Shen Yuan's surprise, Shen Jiu dares to speak. His voice is monotonous but serene. Unlike him, Shen Jiu knows how to camouflage his nervousness and pretend to be normal. "The answer is not that simple. Or have you perhaps forgotten the third volume of Resentment of Chunshan?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tianlang-jun leans forward.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Of course not, Master Shen. I even brought a copy with me with the hope that you would sign it. Also this son of mine, of course." The demon looks at Luo Bing-ge without understanding that he is an impostor from another world.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sen Yuan doesn’t blame him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Bing-ge approaches. Despite his relaxed posture, his gaze watches over the three of them. Then, Shen Yuan feels a tingling inside his body, as if he is making sure that his blood is still working. </span>
<em>
<span>This is bad.</span>
</em>
<span> He thinks. </span>
<em>
<span>Only Jiu-ge is free from demon blood. And if Luo Bing-ge finds out, he will force him to drink it.</span>
</em>
<span> In front of him, Shen Qingqiu is livid and terror is reflected in both of his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Are you sure? Maybe you should reread chapter 41." Shen Jiu clicks his tongue disdainfully. "Obviously, your interest in explicit scenes has made you a terrible reader. You have to look at the composition of the story and its characters."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead of being offended, the demon smiles and rests his face on his hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Interesting, Master Shen... So chapter 41?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Exactly. I could point you to other examples, but I find this to be the most interesting in the current situation."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan breathes a sigh of relief as the unpleasant feeling of someone poking around inside him subsides. But the break is brief. Following his directions, Luo Binghe gets closer with the purpose of sitting down with them. But he chooses to stand behind Shen Jiu and wrap an arm around his waist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shizun, this one is disappointed. I'm here, but you prefer talking about books with... him." His displeasure is evident. Luo Bing-ge glares at Tianlang-jun without hiding his mistrust. Behind the former demon lord, Zhuzhi-lang takes a defensive stance. "So cruel, shizun. Although this one is curious. What is my father doing here?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan restrains himself from smiling victoriously. Luo Bing-ge has taken the bait. Any anomaly between the two timelines should intrigue a bored emperor.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I'm also curious." Shen Yuan speaks not only to win as well but also to attract Luo Bing-ge's attention and leave his brother alone. Although after confirming that he is the only one he cannot manipulate with his blood, it is quite likely that he will try to physically control him. "I mean, it was our fault but this master doesn't understand why..." Oh no. Saying in front of Luo Bing-ge, who merged the two worlds, Tianlang-jun's plans? Horrible idea. Retreat. "Why did you abandon Luo Binghe?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Perhaps it is not the best topic of conversation, as both the son and the father become tense. Or the other way around: perhaps it is an ideal topic of conversation. As a former internet troll, Shen Yuan has experience with controversy and how to create incendiary debates.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Look at him!" Shen Yuan breaks the silence by feigning more ignorance. "He is a good boy. Perhaps too intense and we should work on his homicidal intentions, but he is a great cook, caring, an expert in housework..." None of his compliments seem to flatter Luo Bing-ge, whose smile turns sarcastic. Well, maybe then the emperor will learn what kind of Luo Binghe is appreciated in this world. "We all believed that our Luo Binghe was an orphan."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"That's thanks to his mother. I was recently aware that I had a son."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although an upset Tianlang-jun is terrifying, Shen Yuan is not scared. The intruder from the other world is even more disturbing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I don't know who the woman who gave birth to me is, but my mother is someone else." Luo Binghe growls.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Uh oh. Luo Bing-ge doesn't seem as interested in his family as he had supposed. Tianlang-jun shrugs lightly and turns to look at Shen Jiu.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I would like to continue talking to Master Shen about chapter 41. A scholar like you surely has an interesting point of view to contribute."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I think shizun is busy." Luo Bing-ge narrows his eyes. "No one has yet explained to me what my three shizuns are doing here... Or who should I thank that my original </span>
<em>
<span>dear </span>
</em>
<span>shizun now has both eyes and a tongue."</span>
</p><p>
<span>His smile is sharp as a knife and even Shen Yuan trembles as he fixes his gaze on Shen Qingqiu, who is as stiff and pale as a statue of salt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"The perpetrator should thank his father." Shen Jiu snorts. His calm is also breaking, even though he is the only one of the three who still manages to maintain some composure. "Where are your manners, Luo Binghe? You show up uninvited, interrupting our literary debate."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"That's because shizun suddenly disappeared."</span>
</p><p>
<span>And in front of them, Tianlang-jun listens. He no longer smiles.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It wasn't our decision."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It's what happens when shizun decides to leave the safety of my palace." His smile twists as he hugs Shen Jiu even tighter. "This lord has learned that he must take better care of his shizuns. The three of them."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although his brother pales, his eyes flash with anger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"So..." Shen Yuan clears his throat. "We're not pretending anymore?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Chapter 59." Shen Jiu hisses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tianlang-jun nods.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Zhuzhi-lang."</span>
</p><p>
<span>That is his only warning before a gigantic snake destroys the table and comes between them and Luo Binghe, who backs up, dragging Shen Jiu with him. A chill freezes Shen Yuan's limbs, keeping him frozen. And from his expression of anguish, something similar must be happening to Shen Qingqiu.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Quite interesting..." Tianlang-jun comments. "You're not my son, but you are a heavenly demon. I'm curious how your blood has ended up in two Master Shens."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I can do a demonstration." He brags.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"In your dreams!" Shen Jiu roars before summoning Xiu Ya.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And he uses the sword to force Luo Bing-ge to release him. However, the demon only takes two steps back before walking around him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shizun, you should be nicer. It would be a shame if you lost your brother again."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan gasps as fire shoots through his insides, twisting his organs, causing him to close his eyes and dig his fingernails into his palms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Chapter 57."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Despite having a body with drooping arms, Tianlang-jun is unexpectedly fast. And with a sharp blow to the acupuncture point, Shen Yuan loses consciousness.</span>

<p>Chapter Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>As many of you guessed, chapter 41 is when Shen Jiu mistakes Luo Bing-ge for Luo Binghe. In chapter 59 there is a mention of Zhuzhi-lang turning into a snake (this one was difficult, I admit it!) and in chapter 57 the two Shen brothers lost consciousness. Although Resentment of Chunshan has a different plot, absurd and erotic, I thought it would be more fun to pick some numbers with meaning instead of choosing randomly :3</p></blockquote>

<p>
<span>Nowadays Resentment of Chunshan only has five volumes. Although there is a possibility that its mysterious author will write more, Shen Jiu will take care of that matter once he discovers his identity. Meanwhile, he grudgingly acknowledges that knowing the contents of those infamous novels has its uses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In chapter 41, a shapeshifting demon poses as Luo Binghe and almost tricks them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In chapter 59, they are meeting with a clan of evil demons who want to kill them. At the climax, the demons turn into beasts and treacherously attack them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In chapter 57, the characters were surrounded by succubi who were trying to lure Liu Qingge with his poison. To save him, Shen Jiu knocks him out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although Shen Jiu distrusts Tianlang-jun's intelligence, in the end, it seems that he understood all his messages: this Luo Binghe is an impostor, attacking, putting those who are poisoned to sleep so that the demon cannot manipulate them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu's hand firmly grips Xiu Ya's hilt after he stepped in front of Shen Yuan. Luo Bing-ge laughs, indifferent to the presence of his father, a demonic snake, and a furious Peak Lord. With a flash of black and silver, the demon draws his sword. His Xin Mo is covered with dense and suffocating darkness, making Shen Jiu tremble. It has always been an abominable sword, but right now it seems more wicked than ever.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Are you sure, shizun, that you can protect them from me?" He scoffs with a cruel, crooked smile. "With my blood, I can destroy his guts; I can make your brother wake up in pain... or invade his dreams. Be nice and return to my side or I will punish you."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu grits his teeth. Despite the confidence he tries to convey, he's shaking with horrible panic. And for a brief moment, Shen Jiu ponders the possibility of negotiating with that monster in exchange for him never putting Shen Yuan in danger again. It wouldn’t be the first time that he has risked his life to save someone he loves. That was how he ended up trapped in the Qiu mansion.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>But your life matters too</span>
</em>
<span>, says a voice inside his head that sounds like Mu Qingfang's during their sessions or Shen Yuan's when he gets angry. </span>
<em>
<span>You also have value. You aren’t expendable.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu misses his chance to make a decision when Tianlang-jun moves in with Shen Yuan in his arms. Towards Luo Bing-ge. His eyes widen in fear, though he keeps pointing the sword at his enemy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What are you doing?" He hisses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tianlang-jun ignores him, standing in front of Luo Bing-ge at a safe distance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I will give him to you in exchange for the sword."</span>
</p><p>
<span>His words hit Shen Qinqiu, who pales as the Demon Lord raises an eyebrow in puzzlement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Your traitor! Leave my brother alone."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I'm sorry, Master Shen." Tianlang-jun gives him an apologetic smile. "But as I said, I had two issues with my son. Although this is not the real one, I can tell that this sword is Xin Mo."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Bing-ge's expression is puzzled, though he seems about to burst out laughing. And for once, Shen Jiu is unable to predict him: what will he choose? His obsession with him or the most powerful sword in the world?</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What do you want my shizun and my sword for, old man?" There is a dangerous gleam in his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tianlang-jun is unimpressed by his aura.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"My interest in meeting Master Shen is due to my nephew. Regarding the other, I'm going to merge both realms."</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Luo Bing-ge, who already did it in another world, finally bursts out into a raucous, exaggerated, laugh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"So, this is the situation. The way I see it, shizun, you have two options. Come with me and help me defeat this old man. And the four of us will return to my world." He qualifies the number possessively, confirming Shen Jiu's worst fears. "Or... I will merge both realms myself, is that alright with you, old man?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tianlang-jun has narrowed his eyes and also seems to assess all the possible consequences of this situation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I let you choose, shizun: come with me willingly or give up when I destroy your world and you can only be with me."</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>He is mad!</span>
</em>
<span> Shen Qingqiu grits his teeth despite the horrible panic pulsing inside him. </span>
<em>
<span>He is mad and that makes him even more dangerous.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>"For my part, I have no problem with you merging both realms whenever it happens," Tianlang-jun says in a clear voice, and Zhuzhi-lang protests with a querulous hiss. "However, do you need to claim all three of them?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Of course. I already have a harem of two hundred women, why not one of shizuns as well?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You're insane." Shen Jiu hisses, unable to hide his contempt anymore, his rage, his horror. "You're talking about your master! The one you viciously mutilated and tortured! And you don't even know Shen Yuan! He hasn't done anything to you except look like me."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Bing-ge doesn’t reply. Because he doesn't care. He is no longer a half-demon desperate for affection, but someone who lets his most selfish darkness devour him. He is an emperor who reshaped the world at his whim. And with his power, he can achieve any wish, even the most exaggerated and ridiculous.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu is struck by an old panic that wells up in his bones, from the scars left by the past. </span>
<em>
<span>Is this how he ends?</span>
</em>
<span> He manages to think despite the shock. </span>
<em>
<span>Was I always meant to be someone else's property?</span>
</em>
<span> Slowly, he lowers the sword without noticing the gesture. Unconsciously, he knows how to recognize the best option: the one that won’t destroy the entire world or kill the people he cares about.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The ice rescues him from his daze. It springs up from everywhere, sharp stakes of frost and sharp stalactites. They stand between them and Luo Bing-ge, who hisses more surprised than angry. With an unexpected chill and warmth inside his chest, Shen Jiu turns just as his Luo Binghe and Liu Qingge emerge from the shadows accompanied by Mobei-jun.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The relief he feels is so intense that Shen Jiu almost breaks out laughing and crying, though he ultimately freezes as they burst in. Luo Binghe charges at his other self while Liu Qingge attacks Tianlang-jun. The snake hisses between fury and pain as the ice hits him. It is then when Shen Jiu discovers that Zhuzhi-lang has Shen Qingqiu. </span>
<em>
<span>Dammit!</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>He doesn't allow his runaway emotions to control him anymore. Shen Jiu wields his sword with confidence and determination as he runs towards Zhuzhi-lang. Taking advantage of the demon being distracted by Mobei-jun, he sneaks away toward Shen Qingqiu. His other self is so light that it is easy to pick him up and flee before Zhuzhi-lang notices.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu is backing away with no clear ideas when a familiar voice calls out his name. And he turns just in time to see Liu Qingge with Shen Yuan in his arms. Tianlang-jun is bleeding, though his expression is one of curiosity. And one of his arms is missing, although it is not clear if Liu Qingge has cut it or it has fallen off again on its own.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Follow me!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu nods before following in his shidi's wake as Mobei-jun covers their backs, holding the other two back with his ice. Shen Jiu stops Liu Qingge by yanking his arm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Wait! What about Luo Binghe?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>His disciple is still fighting against his other self with excessive and furious violence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"He will follow us." Liu Qingge frowns with distaste as he speaks. "He can track them."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"But... What if he doesn't win?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan convinced him of his disciple's invincibility, but he has already seen Luo Binghe be fooled too many times. Furthermore, he is using a normal spirit sword while Luo Bing-ge wields a Xin Mo strengthened after years of killing and orgies. At this moment, while one demon has allowed his rage to control him and the other derisively dodges him, the difference between the two of them is abysmal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His worried gaze meets Luo Bing-ge's. And he gives him a crooked smile before backing away with calculated steps under Luo Binghe's wary gaze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I'll give you five days, shizun. You can find me at Maigu Ridge." With a precise blow, the demon opens a portal in the air. "It's a promise, shizun: your happiness, your pain, your sadness, they all belong to me. And if I can't possess any of the three, I will destroy everything you have."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Though he disappears, his menace remains with them even as they use their swords to fly away from the Demon Realm.</span>

<p>
<span>Once Shen Jiu feels that they are safe, despite still being under the red sky of the Demon Realm, he forces them to land on a rocky path, ignoring Liu Qingge's protests and Luo Binghe's misgivings. But there are pending and urgent matters that mustn’t be postponed while the threat of Luo Bing-ge lurks in the shadows.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Luo Binghe!" He hisses and the determination in his voice makes the demon tense. "Get your blood out of them. Now."</span>
</p><p>
<span>It is one of those orders that the demon obeys with his head bowed and without protest. Shen Jiu knows that Shen Qingqiu has been awake for a long time and that he keeps his eyes closed to avoid the others. Even so, he doesn’t hesitate to bring his broken body closer to Luo Binghe despite noticing his discomfort and the panic that beats restlessly under his skin. However, his other self remains stubbornly silent and allows the shadow of his tormentor to touch him. It’s a minimal contact, and yet Shen Qingqiu remains pale and his brows twisted in phantom pain, echoing perhaps his worst memories.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Luo Binghe finishes cleaning the two of them of his infected blood, Shen Jiu finally allows himself to breathe a sigh of relief.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Let's go to the border." He orders the rest before getting back on Xiu Ya.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"My palace is closer." Luo Binghe points. "I'll order food, a bath, and a room to be prepared... for Liu-shishu as well."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge glares at him, but he chooses to hold Shen Yuan's body instead of his weapon. Shen Yuan is no longer limp due to unconsciousness, but sleeps peacefully, his arms around Liu Qingge's neck, his mouth open as he smears drool on his outer robes. Despite his interests, the demon’s argument is consistent, however, Shen Jiu shakes his head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We need to return to the sect and warn the cultivation world of the calamity that threatens us. There is no time to waste, let's go."</span>
</p><p>
<span>While Liu Qingge doesn’t hesitate to follow his command, Luo Binghe is delayed a few seconds, surely sad that he missed such an opportunity, but in the end, he also mounts Zheng Yang and flies behind him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The journey is tense and silent, uncomfortable by the terrifying shadow of Luo Bing-ge and its dire consequences. Eventually, Shen Yuan wakes up and the shock of Liu Qingge holding him in his arms almost makes him fall off the sword. Only the threat of his brother falling into the void makes Shen Jiu stop and insist that Shen Yuan should travel with him, but the others point out that he is already carrying Shen Qingqiu.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"If my second shizun is uncomfortable with Liu-shishu, he can always travel with me." Luo Binghe proposes. Despite his voice being a restrained whisper and his obedient disciple attitude, a smirk struggles to appear on his face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>If it wasn't for the distance, Shen Jiu would have hit him with his fan. Instead, he holds Shen Qingqiu even tighter to hide that raging tremor that beats under his skin and reflects in his voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Luo Binghe!" He hisses. The words crackle in his throat with too much anger, too much rancor out of his control. "Aren't you ashamed? First, you annoy your shishu, and now my brother with your tricks…” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shizun, this disciple hasn't bothered Liu-shishu." He dares to bat his eyelashes in feigned innocence. "Would shizun enlighten this dumb disciple?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Silence! Keep flying and don't waste our time."</span>
</p><p>
<span>In the end, Shen Yuan assures them that there is no problem in traveling with Liu Qingge. He loves it! But today his voice sounds false and without the security of the past. Shen Yuan, moreover, insists, blushing and with a babble, on standing up instead of his arms. Shen Jiu concedes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What was that?" Shen Qingqiu growls at him as they fly again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Aren't you pretending to be asleep anymore? You're welcome, by the way, for removing your demon blood."</span>
</p><p>
<span>His other self snorts contemptuously.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What was that fit of jealousy?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Jealousy? What jealousy? I'm just taking care of my little brother."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don't try to fool me, we are the same person." Shen Qingqiu rolls his eyes. "Just be more subtle next time. I don't want to see a version of myself getting humiliated by a demon or the brute from Bai Zhan Peak."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu announces that his arms are tired and pretends to pass Shen Qingqiu's body to Luo Binghe. In the end, he doesn't do it because it's crucial not to stop, but his repellent other self stops bothering him and just glares at him in silence while they fly between dark clouds.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A few minutes later, they pause again because Shen Yuan prefers to ride behind Liu Qingge instead of in front. It's a ridiculous decision in a time of crisis, but Shen Jiu allows it without hiding his soft spot (and Shen Qingqiu snorts, calling him weak under his breath). However, before Shen Yuan was held tightly in Liu Qingge's powerful arms and now he is as far away from him as the sword will allow and clinging to his clothing as little as possible.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Liu Qingge speeds up, he falls.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu lets out a scream that Shen Qingqiu qualifies as pathetic. Despite the mass hysteria, Luo Binghe is the fastest and catches Shen Yuan in his arms with inimitable precision. His brother, who had turned pale, flushes bright red and begins to mutter nonsense.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We trade swords!" He exclaims between swipes, forcing Luo Binghe to let go of him even though they are still several meters above the ground. "I will fly on Xiu Ya."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We’ll be too much." Shen Qingqiu comments in that irritating voice that Shen Jiu is beginning to hate, despite being identical to his angry tone. "It will be safer if you stand still with the brute or the demon. Or switch places with your brother."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"As if I'm going to leave A-Yuan alone with you, you petty snake."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Jiu-Ge..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu swallows all his words when Shen Yuan gives him puppy eyes. Although he doesn't understand what is stressing him out so much, Shen Jiu has a weak point capable of making him change his mind and even waste their precious time by forcing others to switch swords. In this way, Shen Yuan climbs Xiu Ya. And he, not intending to fall into the petty trap of his other self, endorses Shen Qingqiu's dead weight on Liu Qingge. Probably Shen Qingqiu will only be quiet with him because the War God's patience is scarcer than the rest and he may let him fall if he provokes him with his comments. By default, Shen Jiu gets on Zheng Yang.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This master leads," he warns Luo Binghe, ignoring the fact that this is not his sword.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yes, shizun!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>From his smile, Shen Jiu should have suspected that the demon would gladly stand behind him and hug his waist. Not forcefully or digging his fingers in. It is a precise hug, which makes it impossible to ignore his presence. It's not suffocating or uncomfortable like Luo Bing-ge's touch or the times he held him without permission. It is a delicate but firm, playful touch. Luo Binghe even dares to rest his chin on his shoulder and when he speaks his voice tickles him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shizun, you and your... </span>
<em>
<span>family </span>
</em>
<span>are alright?" Despite his stubborn silence, the demon doesn’t give up. "This disciple was very worried..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Hush, Luo Binghe. We can talk once we arrive."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu had vaguely hoped to reach the sect that night, however, the sunset catches them still at the border. And fatigue wraps around them like a second skin. Shen Yuan almost stumbles off the sword again when he falls asleep on his feet and Luo Binghe has long ago put all of his weight on him and his slow breathing warns that he is also asleep.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With resignation, Shen Jiu assumes that they must rest that night in a border inn.</span>
</p><p>
<span>To avoid a show, Luo Binghe hides his demonic traits and Shen Jiu insists on covering Shen Qingqiu with a coat until he becomes a bundle. That doesn't make him happy at all, but he prefers that degradation to the humiliation of many disgusted looks, and he agrees to remain silent.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although everyone knows that he will try to take revenge later.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Once inside, Luo Binghe asks for two rooms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No way!" Liu Qingge hisses. "That’s not enough for all of us."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Who carries money, Liu-shishu?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>That fact steals all their protest and Liu Qingge shuts up his words as an embarrassed blush covers his cheeks. Since three were kidnapped and the War God, as he now confirms, has never cared about those details. Shen Jiu rubs the bridge of his nose while Shen Yuan sighs, too tired to get angry.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Fine." Shen Jiu growls. "It doesn't matter, we'll be leaving soon in the morning, understood?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>The innkeeper guides them into the hallway. His steps are as nervous as his voice since he senses that none of them is an ordinary person. Perhaps that is why the innkeeper offers them two spacious rooms that are much higher than their budget. Shen Jiu examines them critically. The two are almost identical. They have a bathtub in a corner behind a screen and only one bed, albeit a large one. The decoration is austere without being seedy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>During the year he'd been wandering the country, he'd stayed in worse places. This inn is not luxurious, but today he is accompanied by a spoiled demon, a brute who is still noble, and, most importantly, his brother. Shen Qingqiu would probably adapt to any place, but not them, and that night they must rest to regain their strength. With a nod, he approves.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Bring food and hot water," Shen Jiu orders the innkeeper. "My friends know how to cook. If our money is not enough, they can pay with their services."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Jiu-Ge..." Shen Yuan yawns, unable to shake the sleep clouding his gaze. "You can't treat the protagonist and the second male lead like that."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nobody understands his words, although Shen Jiu already knows enough of his vocabulary to get an idea of the meaning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I can. If they don't like it, let them protest."</span>
</p><p>
<span>No one protests. Liu Qingge's stance is as tense as it gets as he carries Shen Qingqiu, with a different awkwardness than usual. He has pink ears while Luo Binghe gives him a wide smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This disciple will gladly fulfill any shizun's wishes."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You..." Liu Qingge turned towards him so sharply that the </span>
<em>
<span>bundle </span>
</em>
<span>almost hit Luo Binghe's chest. "So cheeky."</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Me? This disciple just wants to make his shizuns happy…” Suddenly, Luo Binghe's eyes widen and he ignores Liu Qingge to turn to Shen Jiu. "This dumb disciple has had a question for a long time, how should I refer to you three? Is the new one also my shizun?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Never." Hisses an angry voice from inside the </span>
<em>
<span>bundle</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Can this disciple use your names as Liu-shishu does?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge is glaring at him with an intensity that almost gives off sparks and smoke. After being kidnapped, fighting, dealing with his other self's poisonous personality, the interest of someone who should be dead, and the obsession of a demon from another world, Shen Jiu is in no mood for his disciple's flirtation. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Although he prefers it when Luo Binghe ignored him to pester Liu Qingge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"To the kitchen, now."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu drags his brother and the </span>
<em>
<span>bundle </span>
</em>
<span>into the first room and closes it with an enlightening slam. Then, he drops Shen Qingqiu on the bed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We have to at least find you some legs." Shen Jiu hisses as he stretches out his arms. "It's tiring to carry around with you all the time."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Being carried is also exhausting." He hisses as he tries to sit up with a pathetic dignity that should have burned by now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Seeing someone identical to him, someone he could have been, struggling with determination not to be relegated to an object, makes something burn inside Shen Jiu's chest. Its relief and hope since even this broken version of him is fighting to recuperate under insane circumstances.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Perhaps later, when Luo Bing-ge's mess is sorted out and he has his limbs back, then Shen Jiu will encourage him to talk to Mu Qingfang to heal all the scars on his soul as well.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Servants bring hot water, and Shen Jiu encourages Shen Yuan to take a bath first before he goes back to sleep. His brother is so tired that he looks like a ghost, and Shen Jiu is afraid that the food will not arrive on time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Meanwhile, he waits while planning tomorrow's tour. Getting to Cang Qiong Mountain is a priority, but perhaps they could split up to warn the minor sects as well. If they found a spirit sword in the city, Shen Yuan could return with Shen Qingqiu to the mountain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He is pondering when the voice of his other self snaps him out of his thoughts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I'm surprised."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"About what?" Shen Jiu raises an eyebrow, intrigued.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"The arrangement of the rooms. I'm surprised that after your fit of jealousy you allowed the two of them to sleep together in the same bed." He smirks maliciously.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I wasn't jealous."</span>
</p><p>
<span>To his relief, Shen Yuan comes out from behind the screen drying his hair with a talisman. The hot bath, instead of waking up his lazy little brother, has only served to make his expression sleepier.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Are you going to explain to me, A-Yuan, why were you so weird when we were flying?" He asks both to change the subject and out of genuine curiosity.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"They are your suitors, not mine." He rubs his eyes as he sits between the two of them. "As your brother, I'm not going to interfere in your love life no matter how hot they are... But you should choose soon, Jiu-ge. It’s not fair for… them."</span>
</p><p>
<span>This is not working. Now the conversation is even more awkward, and from the mischievous gleam in Shen Qingqiu's eyes, his hateful other self is itching to tease him. Shen Jiu clears his throat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Can we talk about important matters like PREVENTING a monster from destroying our world?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Humm… No.” Shen Qingqiu tilts his head to look at Shen Yuan. "What do you think about the beast and the brute sleeping together?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>For some reason, that idea makes him blush.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Ehh... Ah! The other room!" Shen Yuan bursts into hysterical laughter, causing Shen Qingqiu to narrow his eyes curiously.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Of course, what else could this master be talking about?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It's not the first time. I'm sure they have a lot of experience... Just sleeping together!" Shen Yuan hastens to add seeing that Shen Jiu has clenched his fists nervously. Although his cheeks glow bright red as if a certain image had passed over his head. "They have already shared a house, surely it is not a big deal."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh, I see..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Stop messing." Shen Jiu hisses at his other self. "I'm not jealous."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I haven't said anything. Yet."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"And between them there is nothing. Nothing." He insists. "They hate each other."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don't trust the hate of the beast. Mine has gone from torturing me to wanting a harem with ridiculous copies of myself."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Suddenly, Shen Jiu's confidence becomes more fragile. After all, there is a fifth book about their entanglements where their hate turns into something more passionate. And the mysterious author is someone who knows Liu Qingge too well and has been able to consider such a likely scenario.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"A-Yuan..." Unconsciously, a faint murmur escapes him as he looks at his brother. "You've seen them while I was away. Do you think there might be something between them?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan ponders his question. He doesn't seem so sleepy anymore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Well... Maybe my point of view isn't the most appropriate since I didn't realize recently that both of them are attracted to men, though... Fuck."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Your language." Shen Qingqiu scolds him with a disgusted face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What's wrong, A-Yuan?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"They kissed! How did I not suspect anything!?" He covers his face with both hands, stifling a groan. "They kissed! Well... Liu-shidi was the one who kissed Luo Binghe. There were a lot of tongues involved, a lot of indecent touching, and they almost broke a wall. It was quite intense. And hot..." And Shen Yuan adds to himself with a murmur "How come I didn't notice anything?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu is frozen, perplexed, and confused when he hears voices on the other side of the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shizun enjoyed seeing Liu-shishu dressed as a sweet wife, perhaps he would also enjoy seeing you in a maiden's clothes."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I'm going to kill you."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Careful, Liu-shishu. It would be a shame if you dropped your dishes."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Later."</span>
</p><p>
<span>That's a playful and mischievous voice that reminds him of when they rescued him. On that occasion, Luo Binghe was excessively close to Liu Qingge. Shen Jiu clenches his fists, unable to escape from a tremor that rises from his heart. It shouldn't matter to him. It is irrelevant. Just a boring demon who's also bored with him as Qi-Ge did... Shen Jiu shakes his head, trying to banish those thoughts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This master has rushed." He clears his throat to calm his voice. "Liu Qingge looks uncomfortable with Luo Binghe. They should sleep in separate rooms."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Well, well..." Shen Qingqiu tilts his head without erasing his mischievous smirk. "What do you suggest then, </span>
<em>
<span>dear cousin</span>
</em>
<span>? There are five of us and there are only two rooms."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"That's true!" Shen Yuan intervenes. "Jiu-Ge, do you have any preferences?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>And he opens his mouth, unable to reply.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He doesn't even understand why he's so jealous or for whom. Because someone is interested in Liu Qingge? (Who doesn't?) Or because Luo Binghe isn't paying the same attention to him anymore?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu is so lost in his thoughts that he doesn't notice the knowing look the other two exchange.</span>

<p>
<span>If his brother were a computer, right now he would be with a blank screen and without reacting. Shen Yuan can't help but mischievously laugh up his sleeve. The words of the original Shen Qingqiu have pushed him into an especially touchy state, and Luo Binghe teasing Liu Qingge has only aggravated it. Now the five of them should be having dinner with some peace after the recent incidents, but Shen Jiu is still acting like a broken computer. Or a fussy cat that must make a choice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Shen Yuan is looking forward to Shen Jiu making that decision soon.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Thoughtful, Shen Yuan plays with his chopsticks. Since he came to this world, he always thought about surviving, never about love. Not even when Madame Meiyin predicted his romantic future. First, because that body and therefore that prediction belongs only to Shen Jiu. Second, all women are doomed to end up in Luo Binghe's harem. But in the end, the author himself has pointed out who each soulmate belongs to and Luo Binghe is a capricious bisexual who is no longer interested in women.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan just wanted to escape the plot, but over time he has found a new family. And now he's wondering if maybe it's possible to not just survive, but live without regret. Discovering the world, making his own decisions... falling in love.</span>
</p><p>
<span>What Shen Yuan is NOT thinking about is the fact that before he passed out and changed bodies he said something stupid to Liu Qingge. He is also not thinking that he has suddenly woken up in Liu Qingge's arms, too close to him and after drooling all over his clothes. And, of course, he's already forgotten about his pathetic attempts to keep a respectful distance from his brother's romantic interests.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It is better to laugh at Shen Jiu while he waits for him to decide before Shen Yuan can cultivate his own feelings. Or see how original Shen Qingqiu pretends not to be hungry until Shen Jiu threatens him to eat some. At least his pride doesn't stop him from being fed by someone identical to him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Liu Qingge and Luo Binghe go to their room, the atmosphere calms down a bit. Shen Yuan forgets his manners while lying on the bed as he takes a deep breath and closes his eyes. His head hurts after dying to wake up in his old body, being kidnapped by a snake, stumbling upon a plot that wasn’t in the book, escaping Luo Bing-ge's threat, and losing his face for stupid (gay) panics.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You are not going to do anything?" Shen Qingqiu, that wicked snake, keeps bothering Shen Jiu, who hisses like a cat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No. I'm neither jealous nor do I care what happens between them." He growls before adding. "Furthermore, you and Luo Binghe can't be in the same room and I won't let you bother Liu Qingge either. Much less leave you alone with A-Yuan. And if I stayed here to watch over you that would mean leaving A-Yuan alone with Luo Binghe and, since he already tried to kidnap him during a qi deviation, I don't trust his intentions towards my brother."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu lets out a mocking laugh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"In short, you've thought about it but haven't found a convenient solution."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu refuses to answer. Instead, he picks him up and drops him onto the bed like a sack of potatoes. Shen Qingqiu straightens up a bit to glare at him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"One day I will regain mobility." It sounds like a threat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I'll be waiting for it."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You know you're the same person, right?" Shen Yuan intervenes. "Can't you get along? Teasing between you is almost like attacking yourself."</span>
</p><p>
<span>The two exchange a look before replying at the same time, "No."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Find. Nevermind. But please, just use words and not weapons, okay?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>No one promises him anything. Which doesn't mean much either, since they're both perfect liars. Still, Shen Yuan would be calmer if his brother at least tried. Fortunately, his intervention serves to stop them from fighting like vermin, and for a few minutes, there is peace in the room. Until a sharp blow startles them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu draws Xiu Ya, Shen Yuan gets up, and Shen Qingqiu tenses, all three ready to meet any attack. However, the blow has sounded behind the wall. Shen Yuan frowns before turning to his brother.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Jiu-Ge, that is Liu-shidi and Luo Binghe's room, right?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu silently nods.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The three wait, but there are no more blows. However, there is one fact that none of the five appreciated when the innkeeper showed them the rooms: they are so close together that you can perfectly hear each other's voices.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"That hurt, Liu-shishu." Luo Binghe purrs in the same teasing tone that he used earlier to annoy him. "Next time you could push me onto the bed instead of the wall."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Preposterous!" Liu Qingge hisses and Shen Yuan can perfectly imagine his face flushed with a mixture of anger and embarrassment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And there is a part of him that wants to be there watching Liu Qingge holding the protagonist against the wall with the same intensity with which he kissed him once. </span>
<em>
<span>Why didn't I suspect anything?</span>
</em>
<span> He reproaches himself. </span>
<em>
<span>Why didn't I realize that it's not very straight to get turned on by a kiss between men?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>While he is dealing with his inner thoughts, they keep talking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Stop playing and take off your clothes." Liu Qingge orders and someone, perhaps Shen Qingqiu, gasps, and someone, obviously Shen Jiu, drops his fan on the ground.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Why don't you undress me, Liu-shishu?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>That is a line that Shen Yuan has read many times that precedes... Now he is the one who is red and suffocated. Not like Shen Jiu, who is pale and wide-eyed. There is another blow, and Shen Yuan realizes that Liu Qingge has accepted the challenge. But he doesn't hear him undressing Luo Binghe, but the noise of cloth ripping impatiently. And then something that sounds like a muffled moan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"So big." Liu Qingge clicks his tongue in disgust. "How have you been able to walk all this time?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan is about to burn. He already knows that Luo Binghe's heavenly pillar has a magnificent size and thickness that only exists in fiction, but Liu Qingge sounds surprised. And very few things can surprise the War God.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You know, Jiu-Ge? Maybe we should all just surrender to Luo Binghe's harem…" He comments with a nervous giggle as he turns to his brother.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But his brother is missing and there is an open door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh, this will be fun." Shen Qingqiu chuckles before a slamming door shakes the entire inn.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What are you two supposed to be doing!?" They hear Shen Jiu's furious voice and how it turns into a surprised exclamation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shizun?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shen Jiu?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"SINCE WHEN YOU'RE HURT, LUO BINGHE? And, shidi, isn't there a more indecent way to care for my disciple?" His voice is a curious mixture of concern and sarcasm. "Binghe, to bed. Now. Shidi, bring water."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu continues to laugh as footsteps rush past in the corridor.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Do me a favor." Shen Yuan is startled when he speaks to him. "When that brute returns, put up a talisman and seal the room with those three inside."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"That won't make Jiu-Ge happy."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You also want him to resolve his feelings, am I wrong?" Shen Qingqiu raises an eyebrow, daring him to contradict him. "In case you all forgot, we're up against an insane demon who has already destroyed a world and plans to do the same to this one if we don't surrender to him. I need this pathetic other me to keep his cold mind and that won't happen as long as he's blinded by his emotions."</span>
</p><p>
<span>It's a good argument, more reasonable than Shen Yuan's selfish motives. When Liu Qingge returns, he does as Shen Qingqiu has instructed. After sealing the room, Shen Yuan returns and sits on the edge of the bed. </span>
<em>
<span>Fuck! In the end, I will sleep with the scum villain. </span>
</em>
<span>He realizes. Although this Shen Qingqiu doesn’t pose any threat, it is still uncomfortable to be around him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Do you know?" Shen Yuan clears his throat to put on his most confident facade. "This wouldn't have happened if you hadn't been pestering him about this."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I know myself and therefore I know him." Shen Qingqiu's gaze seems more focused on the wall that separates the two rooms than his eyes. "I know what I can do during an irrational impulse of jealousy. Like throwing tea at an unlucky child. I've had a lot of time to meditate on my emotions and how they marked my downfall. Perhaps everything would have been different if I had been colder. They have accused me of being indifferent, but if it were true, not so many people would have died nor would it have affected me so much."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan doesn't know what to say, so he sits on the other end of the bed and looks at the remains of the villain he used to hate so much.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Do you regret it?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>He tries to shrug before turning his head and looking at him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I don't want to talk about the past, but with you. About you. Who are you?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan trembles even though he doesn't seem to judge him like Shen Jiu did the first time they met. Since he doesn't know what his brother told him and doesn't want to contradict him, Shen Yuan plays dumb.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What are you talking about?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What kind of person are you?" Suddenly, Shen Yuan realizes that he is just being curious. "What do you like? What is your favorite tea?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh. Well... I love to read. Also, I miss reading other people's adventures instead of living them."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan has been unconscious for too long. He is no longer sleepy despite the darkness that has dyed the sky indigo and black. And he also wants to know the person better, not the character mistreated by the narrative. So the two talk, exchanging questions and answers that smooth out the awkwardness between them.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu is furious after confirming that he cannot open the door. Although Shen Qingqiu can't even get out of bed by himself or handle a talisman, he knows that it was an idea of his devious other self.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Reluctantly assuming that he is trapped in that room with the other two, Shen Jiu turns his back to the door and walks toward them with purposeful steps. Luo Binghe is sitting on the bed. His smile almost deceived him that he had been injured while fighting Luo Bing-ge. And if it wasn't for Liu Qingge, he wouldn't have noticed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"The two of you, each one in a corner of the bed." He orders them decisively. "This master will be in the middle. Is it clear?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge nods, averting his gaze, and Luo Binghe's smile becomes brighter and more enthusiastic.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yes, shizun!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>He is a little nervous when they blow out the only candle. Although the bed is wide, not enough for three grown men. Shen Jiu doesn’t dare to move so as not to touch anyone. It's not fear. It is not that atrocious panic that affected him in his time as a disciple. It is the awkwardness of not distinguishing the nature of his feelings even though he has already slept with Liu Qingge once and even kissed him or took care of Luo Binghe's meridians without caring about his closeness. But now suddenly everything has become different and he doesn't want them to misunderstand any spontaneous touch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu takes a deep breath and tries to sleep staring at the ceiling.</span>

<p>
<span>Pretending to be asleep is a wise move in his situation. And Shen Jiu's acting is perfect. No one would differentiate him from a person deep in peaceful sleep instead of the sea of nervousness bubbling inside his chest. And perhaps in other circumstances, he would have fallen asleep because it is an excellent night, calm, not too cold but not too warm. It is almost tolerable to feel two bodies against him. Unfortunately, the presence of those two bodies is the reason for his nervousness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His acting skills are excellent because after a while Shen Jiu notices Luo Binghe turning around. Now the half-demon is looking at him. And he gets a little closer. Shen Jiu clings to his self-control to ignore the tickle of his curls against his face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Liu-shishu, are you sleeping?" Luo Binghe whispers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yes."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh great." Despite having his eyes closed, Shen Jiu knows that Luo Binghe is smirking. "What was the show from before, Liu-shishu?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge doesn’t reply. Unfortunately, his talent for acting is worse than Shen Jiu’s. Starting with the fact that he made the mistake of responding earlier and it's too late to keep quiet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Liu-shishu." Luo Binghe insists with an evil purr. "Were you trying to make shizun jealous?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu nearly chokes. But he manages to keep his stance relaxed while Liu Qingge tenses up, hitting his arm with an elbow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Stop talking nonsense." He hisses. "Rather, stop talking. You're going to wake up Shen Jiu."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You're the only one yelling." Luo Binghe points in a careful whisper. Shen Jiu can feel that Liu Qingge trembles. "So?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge insists on keeping quiet. With an amused sigh, Luo Binghe sits up a bit to get closer to him and thus crush Shen Jiu with his body. The cultivator holds his breath as he forces himself to stay relaxed instead of tensing under the weight of the demon, who is poking a finger at Liu Qingge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shishu... Shishu~"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Now what do you want, annoying beast!?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fortunately, Shen Jiu is already awake. Otherwise, he would have been furious at Liu Qingge for yelling loud enough to be heard in the other room as well. The War God turns to face Luo Binghe and now Shen Jiu is a bit more trapped between the two of them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Why do you react like that, Liu-shishu? This disciple just asked a simple and innocent question."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You never say anything innocent." Liu Qingge growls, still not lowering his voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe laughs softly before changing his stance, completely crushing Shen Qingqiu, to get even closer to Liu Qingge. A muffled noise reveals that the demon has covered his mouth with a hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Tsss... Stop yelling or you'll wake up shizun." He whispers despite the fact that, first, he is lying on top of Shen Jiu, second, in the unlikely event that they hadn't startled him, Liu Qingge's abrupt jerks to break free of his grip would have already woken him up. "This disciple just wants to talk to you... Ouh."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe moans as Liu Qingge bites his hand. Shen Jiu no longer knows if standing between them was a bad or a great idea, only that his intuition is correct and that their tension is not something that his jealousy imagined. If he hadn't intervened, maybe that night those two would have gotten entangled in something different and he and his family would have had to listen to them behind the wall. Although it would have been an amusing sight to see on the other Shen Qingqiu's face, Shen Jiu would have killed them later for doing filthy things in his brother's presence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And for giving him false hope.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge has managed to free himself from Luo Binghe's hand and has now gotten up as well to push him against the bed so that Shen Jiu is crushed between his chests as they argue in whispers over his head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What do you want now? Do you demons never rest?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Not when I have two beauties in my bed."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu wishes to disappear. </span>
<em>
<span>Please don't let A-Yuan listen to this</span>
</em>
<span>, he thinks as Liu Qingge pulls Luo Binghe's hair, causing him to moan shamelessly again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Tell me what you want and let me sleep." Liu Qingge hisses, this time lowering his voice slightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I wanted to thank Liu-shishu."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"And you can't wait until tomorrow!?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Well, first I wanted to know if Liu-shishu was provoking shizun."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I'm not you!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Liu-shishu..." Luo Binghe sighs. "Your voice."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge grunts under his breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I'm not you." He repeats, this time in a more measured tone. "I would never pursue another person in such a cowardly strategy. I respect Shen Jiu too much."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"But would you kiss another person?" Luo Binghe teases him, making him fidget uncomfortably. "What did that mean, Liu-shishu? That you don't respect Shen Yuan or that you wanted to kiss me?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Didn't you want to thank me!?" Liu Qingge is as terrible at changing the subject as he is at whispering. "You already have. Now sleep."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe's laugh reverberates in his chest. Shen Jiu can feel it behind his back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You don't even know what I want to thank you for."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Probably up to no good."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Well, this disciple is grateful to Liu-shishu for allowing us the current situation." Shen Jiu can also feel Liu Qingge's tension. After all, he has his head resting on his heart and can hear his restless heartbeat. "But this disciple wanted to thank you for caring about my condition. It made me feel... happy."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I'm starting to regret it."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe laughs. Leaning towards the War God, Shen Jiu ends up spinning as well until he is completely trapped with his face buried in Liu Qingge's chest and his back against the demon's.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This disciple liked the kiss, Liu-shishu." He whispers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It's a few words, capable of further altering Liu Qingge's pulse and making Shen Jiu hold his breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Sleep." The cultivator growls. "It's a miracle you didn't wake up Shen Jiu."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don't worry about it, Liu-shishu. This disciple also masters dream manipulation."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"DID YOU FORCE HIM TO SLEEP!?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No, but I can tell when Shizun wakes up."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu tenses up. Luo Binghe just told him that he knows he has never been asleep in the first place. There were never any secrets in that conversation, rather his intention was for him to listen to them. Furious and embarrassed, Shen Jiu breaks his mobility to elbow him. Luo Binghe laughs softly before reaching out and hugging him from behind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Liu-shishu..." He keeps talking this time with a less mischievous voice. "Shizun likes you. I know that. And... I think I also like Liu-shishu."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Now what are you talking about?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This disciple suspects that shizun feelings toward me aren't entirely negative either."</span>
</p><p>
<span>It sounds like a question, one that Shen Jiu doesn't know how to answer or what to answer, so he remains quiet and still between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"That would be great because I love shizun too."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You contradict yourself, beast."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I'm not. But I hope shizun is better at math than Liu-shishu."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu absently nods. He has indeed understood Luo Binghe's message, although it does not clear his feelings, but rather stirs them up. At least it calm the voice of his stupid jealousy, </span>
<em>
<span>They both came back,</span>
</em>
<span> he forces himself to remember. But Shen Jiu is not used to being loved and he still trembles with fear that it is a false affection or fleeting or doomed to disappear. Instinctively, Shen Jiu hugs Liu Qingge's clothes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Huh?" The cultivator stiffens. "I think he's waking up."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh, don't worry, Liu-shishu. Shizun is still dreaming. It must be a nice dream." He adds in a melodious voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu turns long enough to elbow him again, then lays his head on his chest. Much to his chagrin, Luo Binghe's ample chest is more comfortable than he had imagined. Guessing his intentions, the demon moves to push Liu Qingge against them, giving him an excuse to sleep lying between them. The cultivator makes a move to move away, but Luo Binghe stops him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Stay still or you'll wake up Shen Jiu."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge has no choice but to obey.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>The next morning, Shen Yuan waits impatiently for the door to the other room to open. He still doesn't know whether or not to confess to his brother that the walls remained just as thin as before, something that the others forget, and they were able to hear a good part of a certain conversation. </span>
<em>
<span>Fuck</span>
</em>
<span>, Shen Yuan can't get over how pornographic Luo Binghe's moans were when Liu Qingge did… Well, he doesn't know what he did, but the demon liked it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Unexpectedly, Shen Qingqiu seems much livelier that morning and doesn't object with his usual stubborn pride when Shen Yuan offers to fix his hair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Do you know?" Shen Yuan comments with feigned nonchalance. "I'm beginning to suspect that you're playing matchmaker to take over Jiu-Ge's house."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh. How is that?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You're trying to make him the wife of another Peak Lord or a Demon Lord! You're clearly trying to appropriate his title."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It's also my title."</span>
</p><p>
<span>He hasn’t denied it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan snorts, still wary when Shen Qingqiu tenses up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What's going on?" Shen Yuan asks as he stands up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And finally, he discovers a tiny green snake on the floor of the room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It’s probably a coincidence." Shen Yuan stammers. "Right?"</span>

<p>
<span>Within the room, there is a tension capable of destroying entire cities. Still, Zhuzhi-lang resists the pressure of five wary gazes that scrutinize all his movements, his expression, and even the snakes peeking out of his sleeves. Shen Yuan, sheltered by the protection of a Demon Lord, a War God, and an Overprotective Big Brother, allows himself the luxury of hiding behind the other three. Although all his memories of Zhuzhi-lang are blurred, since he always ends up either unconscious or inside the mouth of a giant snake, Shen Yuan is aware of the danger and does not relax.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Zhuzhi-lang lifts his head, triggering an avalanche of tense postures and hands on the hilts of swords ready to be drawn. The innocence in his wide eyes does not match the suspicion that beats in Shen Yuan's heart.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You can relax. This one would never hurt any Master Shen." He asserts with a determination that lights up his features.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan believes in him, however, his brother clicks his tongue disdainfully.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Perhaps you do not wish to harm us, however, your uncle had no qualms about sacrificing my brother."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh, about that..." His voice trails off, affected by embarrassment. "He never intended to hand over Master Shen, but to get the sword and then get rid of his opponent."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You just admitted that your uncle is a liar, how do you expect us to believe you?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Because I am not lying when I promise that I owe Master Shen a debt and I will do my best to save you. The three of you." He adds vehemently. "And you need us. Both to escape the clutches of the demon who looks like my lord's son but isn't and to survive when the two realms merge."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We have no intention of letting that happen." Liu Qingge intervenes with an angry growl.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"With all due respect, you are at a disadvantage. None of your weapons can rival Xin Mo and you cannot take on my lord's false son and protect the three Master Shen at the same time. Furthermore, we will not oppose him since we almost share the same goal."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"That is not a wise move." Shen Jiu says. "Our security is incompatible with the triumph of that demon."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Zhuzhi-lang pauses thoughtfully.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Then, it's even worse for you: you can't fight him and protect all the Shen Masters while we prevent you from succeeding. Both realms must unite, that is Junshang's wish. And only the Shen Masters deserve to survive."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Zhuzhi-lang's words infuriate Luo Binghe and Liu Qingge, who seem ready to draw their swords and challenge him right now. However, Shen Jiu leaning his fan against the demon's chest and Shen Yuan holding his shidi's sleeve prevent bloodshed. Although none of those gestures is enough to calm their rage. However, Zhuzhi-lang is right: they are stuck at a difficult crossroads where all paths seem to lead to disaster.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu sighs before taking a step towards Zhuzhi-lang. Ever since the demon snake appeared, the five of them have kept their distance. And now Shen Jiu breaks that cautious rule, though he doesn't get too close to the demon, just close enough to grab all of his attention and command his presence. Since he has perfected the art of being threatening without the need to shout or use violence. Just one glare is enough for Zhuzhi-lang to pale a bit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Let this master guide you in a fairly accurate prediction of what may happen in the next half shichen." His voice is cold and calm, with the power to go through the skin and become a chill. "First of all, this master has no interest in fighting inside this inn and causing unnecessary destruction. So we'll just assume without actually doing what will happen, okay? Right now, you're at a disadvantage."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Zhuzhi-lang frowns, sharing the same confusion as Shen Yuan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Perhaps." He concedes. "But I am not your enemy."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You are as long as you oppose our intentions." Shen Jiu hits his hand with the fan with a thud that startles even Shen Yuan. Each hit accompanies his next words, sharp and furious. "Maybe you don't want us to be hurt and you won't hurt us personally, but do you think that the death of our friends and family will make us happy? Haven't you appreciated that the destruction of our world will only bring us suffering? That way no debt is paid, Zhuzhi-lang, you will only make us regret giving you our help."</span>
</p><p>
<span>The weight of that truth makes Zhuzhi-lang open his eyes, confused and surprised. Before he gets over his daze, Shen Jiu continues speaking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"As this master was saying, right now you can't defeat us. And, more importantly, you can't escape either. So I'd appreciate it if you didn't try, understood?" He tilts his head and Shen Yuan sees from the side that he is smiling evilly. "Despite your twisted sense of duty, this master appreciates your attempt to come and convince us, so I have no intention of killing or hurting you either. For now. However, I must point out that you have made numerous mistakes: we are not alone. We have the support of the Cang Qiong Mountain Sect and probably the Huan Hua Palace as well. We can gather the cultivation world, and as a general of Tianlang-jun, you must remember the consequences of our power."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Zhuzhi-lang nods. He is rigid and has clenched his fists, affected perhaps by terrible memories.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You have also not appreciated that we are not defenseless, but that we have certain resources. Like a sword capable of competing against Xin Mo."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"That's not possible..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"In the same way that there are two Luo Binghe, there are also two Xin Mo. I hope that an identical sword meets your requirements for a weapon worthy of rivaling Xin Mo." However, Shen Jiu does not recognize that none of them want to risk using Xin Mo for the excessive price it demands. "Regarding your role, thanks to your hypothetical defeat we would also avoid the pressure of possible kidnapping and this master assumes that Tianlang-jun will not sacrifice his nephew either. Is it clear now?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>He is smirking when he turns to Luo Binghe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Perhaps my dear disciple has brought immortal binding cables? Or do you know another method to neutralize a demon?" His voice sounds sweet and that is precisely why it is so uncomfortable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Everyone, absolutely everyone, tenses at what his words imply.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shen Jiu..." Liu Qingge warns him. "What are you planning now?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This master believes that it was obvious: for the sake of our safety and that of the world, we must take a hostage." He turns to Zhuzhi-lang. "Don't move. I have no intention of destroying the inn and no matter how much you resist, you can't beat us right now. It's quicker and less annoying if you accept your defeat."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan sighs. He doesn't know if it reassures him or not that despite so many kidnappings, his brother hasn't changed his attitude.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We're not taking that snake with us." Liu Qingge hisses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We're taking Zhuzhi-lang as a </span>
<em>
<span>guest</span>
</em>
<span>. The other cultivators will have no choice but to act if they see that Tianlang-jun's general has returned. Or how do you expect to justify the threat? No one will believe us if we speak of another world and another Luo Binghe, but they will accuse ours."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"With justified reasons." He grumbles, glancing sideways at Luo Binghe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Well, I can't deny that, but it is incoherent to say that we are going to defeat Luo Binghe with Luo Binghe's help."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You're going to use Junshang as a scapegoat?" Zhuzhi-lang hisses angrily as he straightens up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It is not a lie: perhaps your uncle doesn't have the sword nor will he be the one who attacks us, but it is also his wish and you have recognized that he plans to support our enemy from the shadows. Now, stop trying to flee. You're a valuable hostage and I wouldn't like to damage this inn."</span>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Kidnapping is not always the solution, Jiu-ge." Shen Yuan tells him a quarter of an hour later, after destroying a part of the inn and trapping a raging snake demon with the ease Shen Jiu had predicted. "What do you plan to do with him? The other cultivators will want to kill him!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Shen Yuan is not so heartless as to push him to certain death.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu rests the tip of his fan on his lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Zhuzhi-lang is not stupid. Although he has resisted, he has allowed us to catch him because he is interested in staying by our side and spying on our movements. See those little snakes? With their help, he will inform Tianlang-jun of our movements no matter how much we keep him locked up. I'd rather see my enemy and monitor the information they receive than allow them to move in the shadows."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, he smiles before patting him on the head and rejoining the rest.</span>

<span>The presence of his unexpected </span>
<em>
<span>guest </span>
</em>
<span>changes all of Shen Jiu's plans. His initial intention was to send Shen Yuan and his other self to the sect to warn Yue Qingyuan of the danger while the three of them alerted the other sects. However, Zhuzhi-lang is dangerous, even tied up, and not worth the risk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Xiao Jiu… I’m glad you’re back.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yue Qingyuan's smile was part relief and part stress. Their sect leader is unable to hide his astonishment at their sudden arrival after the mysterious kidnapping, dragging a demon he had recognized as an iconic figure from the past to lock him up in the Lingxi Caves.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu almost feels remorse when he looks into his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I have to talk to you."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yue Qingyuan takes a deep breath. The insignificant detail that he has not corrected is a warning that he is not going to say anything good to him.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan gazes with a lump in his throat at what has been his third body for a short time. Right now the body is lying on a bed and Mu Qingfang explains that he has been preserving it ever since his soul left him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“At first, it was a precaution since we didn't know what had happened to you. If the two Shen-shixiong hadn't disappeared as well, then I would have feared that it had been a rejection of your soul by the body created by the seeds. I once made the mistake of giving you up for dead, so I chose to protect the body from rotting." Mu Qingfang pauses. "But now..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>His gaze stops at Shen Qingqiu. The original had no choice but to accept Shen Yuan carrying him to Qian Cao Peak after receiving an invitation from Mu Qingfang. And Shen Yuan was desperate to stay distracted while Liu Qingge and Shen Jiu are busy making plans with Yue Qingyuan and Luo Binghe has gone to mobilize the Huan Hua Palace against </span>
<em>
<span>Tianlang-jun.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>"I want that body." Shen Qingqiu acknowledges. There is certain greed in his eyes, like a child who has been offered a luxurious toy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mu Qingfang nods.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I had assumed so. Although Shen-ershixiong has created a precedent, transferring a soul from one body to another is a delicate process and one that is not documented in any medical treatise. I will investigate." He promises Shen Qingqiu, who had already pursed his lips in disgust. “This body is similar to the one we are cultivating, so I should find a connection to get your soul into this body instead of waiting several years for another to be ready, but… It is still a risky process. Shen-ershixiong's soul has too easily left this body to return to the original, are you sure you want to risk it?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Mu-shidi, between a dependent eternity with no legs or even arms and the promise of a solution, which would you choose?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan narrows his eyes suspiciously. He's not entirely sure if this is the first time Shen Qingqiu acknowledges his martial brother relationship with Mu Qingfang, but he suspects it. Now that he has his tongue back, Shen Qingqiu is being strangely polite to everyone, which confirms his suspicion: he plans to unseat Shen Jiu from his position at some point in the future.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Perhaps returning his limbs will have horrible consequences, but even Shen Yuan recognizes that his current state is a terrifying nightmare.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The door opens and a Ning Yingying appears who is not wearing the green uniform of Qing Jing Peak, but in more mature clothes. Shen Yuan looks away, uncomfortable in the presence of another character from the original book. Another of his mistakes was considering that the relationship between Luo Binghe and Ning Yingying was a tender childhood friends to lovers. If that were true, Luo Binghe would not have married a hundred more women or given a higher position in his harem to her instead of those with whom he shared his hatred towards Shen Qingqiu. A significant detail that should have made him suspicious of Luo Binghe's true feelings.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After cupping her hands towards them, Ning Yingying raises her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"The arrivals from Tianyi Overlook and Zhao Hua Temple have arrived." She reports. "Yue-shibo has requested that all Peak Lords be present."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Understood, thanks." Shen Qingqiu is the first to respond.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although his warm smile may be directed at his favorite disciple and the only one who understands what it means to leave your world, Shen Yuan trembles. Shen Qingqiu, the same annoying character who shunned the sect's social conventions, is now eager to go to that meeting. Too bad that it depends on him to be transported.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At least Mu Qingfang has gotten him a xianxia wheelchair, which is more comfortable and less humiliating than being carried.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The three of them head to Qiong Ding Peak. Along the way, they meet some abbots and nuns of Zhao Hua Temple. Shen Yuan walks over to greet Monk Wu Chen, whom he remembers from Jinlan City.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I can't believe you two are different people!" He exclaims, mistaking Shen Qingqiu for Shen Jiu, even though technically he's right. "Which one did I meet in Jinlan City?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It was me." Shen Yuan smiles. "How are your wounds?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Perfectly."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although sower’s rot caused him to lose his legs, Monk Wu Chen is now on his feet thanks to two prosthetics. Looking at them, Shen Qingqiu's eyes widened with desire. Shen Yuan hums, amused at his reaction. Perhaps Mu Qingfang can prepare some prosthetic limbs for him as well as a temporary measure while they sort out the alternate body.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The other option hasn't been mentioned by anyone, but it's pretty obvious: demon blood.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan shivers as he remembers all that that implies. Saying goodbye with a polite smile to Monk Wu Chen, he hijacks the wheelchair to get away from the crowd.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You are not going in the direction of Qiong Ding Peak." Although Shen Qingqiu's voice is calm, there is a hint of panic in his words. "Don't you want anyone to hear us? Or don't you want anyone else to see me?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu's contempt for himself is terrifyingly obvious, but it's not what he's worried about right now. Shen Yuan stops in the middle of the Rainbow Bridge and takes a deep breath before speaking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I know how you got your eye and tongue back." His silence is illuminating. "I also know how Zhuzhi-lang found us so quickly. When were you going to tell us that he gave you his blood?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It wasn't necessary for a modicum of intelligence and I'm relieved that you noticed, Yuan-di."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Annoyed by his jarring calmness, Shen Yuan walks to stand in front of him and crosses his arms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You have a disadvantage right now! Only Zhuzhi-lang can remove his blood from your body and I don't think he will. He can control you."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It was a bet." Shen Qingqiu acknowledges. "I didn't have much of a choice either, that poor snake was horrified at my appearance. But I accepted it because they offered me something priceless and I’m not the object of his obsession, but collateral damage. Furthermore, his desperate attempt to protect the two of you will never outshine Luo Binghe's hatred."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan massages his temple. Although he understands Shen Qingqiu's logic, his decision is still a headache.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You have put us in danger." He accuses him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You can fix it if you give me another body."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu is just as arrogant and shameless as his brother, but this time his trick doesn't work. Shen Yuan snorts before grabbing the wheelchair again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We're going to the Lingxi Caves. Either you convince Zhuzhi-lang to take his blood from you or I'll leave you in there with him."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu grits his teeth like a cat that has been scolded.</span>

<p>
<span>Shen Yuan is late.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu frowns, more worried than upset. Mu Qingfang has been the last of the Peak Lords to arrive. The twelve have gathered before receiving the delegations from the other sects. There are still some differences between them on how to handle the situation. Lying about the identity of the Luo Binghe from the other world may backfire if they find out the truth later, but revealing what happened in the other world might ruin his Luo Binghe's future forever. Although Shen Qingqiu won't justify his attitude in the past few years, he also can't judge him when he has done worse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan is one of those who opposes putting all the blame on Tianlang-jun. Too bad that Shen Yuan is late. With a nod, Shen Jiu motions for Yue Qingyuan to invite the rest of the cultivators inside. They shouldn't make them wait much longer. So far, Shen Jiu has managed to convince them to give ambiguous answers, mentioning Tianlang-jun without going into specific details. That way, they won't be lying and they can complete the information later. The first to arrive are the monks and nuns from Zhao Hua Temple, then Tianyi Overlook. When they are all gathered, Luo Binghe appears with the Huan Hua Palace. His presence is awkward and that is why he has arrived last.</span>
</p><p>
<span>All cultivators are aware that Luo Binghe has appropriated that sect with despicable methods. Everyone knows that he is in league with the demons and they already consider Huan Hua Palace a demonic sect, although very few know the truth about his heritage. Rumors portray Luo Binghe as an ambitious man who abandoned virtuous cultivation to pursue demonic paths after losing the Alliance Conference.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In retrospect, Shen Jiu hates that his disciple hadn't been more subtle in the past. His arrogance has put him in a difficult situation and he knows that it will be difficult to convince others that they need a demon cultivator to face the demons themselves. Fortunately, Tianlang-jun's name is powerful and evokes terrible memories. Despite the tension among those who have gathered, once Shen Jiu begins to speak, the cultivators forget about Luo Binghe to listen only to his voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Shen Jiu finishes, everyone starts talking at the same time. There are many questions and fears, and although he possesses the answer to most (How has Tianlang-jun been freed? What kind of power does he want to use to merge the two realms?), he remains silent despite some of his martial siblings judging him with their glares. Liu Qingge stands silently with his arms crossed and a frown on his face, keeping an eye on Luo Binghe. While Yue Qingyuan smiles and moderates to prevent the discussion from getting too heated.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Tianlang-jun..." Monk Wu Chen of the Zhao Hua Temple mutters. And there is something in his voice, in his contemplative gaze, that captures Shen Jiu's interest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It is a feeling that beats rapidly in his chest. Despite his calm posture, he is nervous when he turns to the monk to goad him into speaking with curious questions.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Little by little, Monk Wu Chen begins to unravel the story of Tianlang-jun and Su Xiyan. Shen Jiu remembers some details, though not all of them. But now everything is more evident when he raises his head and looks at Luo Binghe, a half-demon who should not have been born. And from his expression, Liu Qingge also seems to have noticed.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>"Oh, Master Shen and Master Shen. Why the pleasure?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Zhuzhi-lang raises his head when they arrive. Despite his sincere smile and sparkling eyes, Shen Yuan is not fooled by the danger posed by the demon general. He also can't forget that he and his uncle are planning a massacre that only they would survive. Shen Yuan pushes the wheelchair in front of the demon. Shen Qingqiu is still upset and doesn't look at either of them, although he can't escape.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Release my… family member from your blood." Shen Yuan hesitates, as the relationship between the three of them is still unclear and there is nothing official at the moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Release?" Zhuzhi-lang blinks in obvious confusion. "You make it sound like I'm chaining him with my blood when my only intention is to help Master Shen."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You will help him by removing your blood." He insists.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I doubt it, Master Shen. This one's help can improve Master Shen's recovery." Despite the respect in his voice, his gaze turns colder, similar to Shen Jiu's when he used to scold him. "Master Shen's injuries are severe and no cultivation remedy will work."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"But with your blood, you can track him down. And manipulate him." Shen Yuan adds bitterly, remembering the helplessness when Luo Binghe controlled his body like a puppet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That accusation makes Zhuzhi-lang straighten up indignantly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I would never do it!" He hisses. "That was never my intention!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Maybe it wasn't, but have you considered the possibility of making him dependent on your blood?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"And what is the problem?" Zhuzhi-lang's confusion seems sincere. "Even my current appearance depends on Junshang. If it wasn't for his powers, I would be the horrendous creature you met in the Bailu Forest right now..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"But...!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yuan-di, stop." Shen Qingqiu finally speaks with a determination that makes Shen Yuan turn to him. "I don't care if his intentions towards me are harmful as long as they are useful to me."</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>That's the problem! </span>
</em>
<span>Shen Yuan wants to burst into tears.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You don't need to sacrifice yourself, stupid Shen Qingqiu! We don't want anyone else to hurt you, even with the best intentions. You're a member of my family now, is that clear to you? We're going to help you. No one will hand you over to Luo Binghe, nor will we abandon you." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Something seems to break inside Shen Qingqiu.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"But the only hideous creature here is me..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"That is not true, Master Shen!" Zhuzhi-lang intervenes, tensing despite his restraints. "Master Shen is as beautiful as the other two. And I promise I'm not lying because I can understand how you feel. My real appearance is a deformed snake. I also don't have arms or legs, I couldn't speak either. I'm useless, contemptible, and grotesque." Zhuzhi-lang looks down as he sighs. "I understand your wish better than anyone. That's why I wanted to help you, Master Shen, even if you weren't one of the two who helped Junshang and me in the past."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan doesn't want to be fooled by any snake, but his heart starts to waver. His sincerity seems authentic and consistent. Zhuzhi-lang has managed to bring tears to Shen Qingqiu's eyes. He takes a deep breath, trying to control his emotions. But he fails. The original villain is crying, and Shen Yuan subconsciously moves to hug him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We'll all help you, okay? I know you don't like promises, but we'll all do our best to get you back on your feet. You have more options, don't choose the riskiest one." Shen Yuan straightens without letting him go to meet Zhuzhi-lang's eyes. "And if his offer is sincere, then he shouldn't mind taking his blood from you and offering it back to you under better circumstances. Right?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>The demon snake nods cautiously.</span>

<p>
<span>"What are you doing here?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan is startled upon hearing his brother's voice. Shen Jiu stands with his arms crossed at the cave entrance, his perfect features twisted into a scowl. His gaze stops first at the two of them and then at Zhuzhi-lang. Even the demon general is unable to remain unruffled by his scrutiny. Zhuzhi-lang gulps, uncomfortable, but unable to flee, while Shen Qingqiu lowers his head so his other self can’t discover his reddened eyes and the signs of tears on his face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"A-Yuan, keep our relative away from our guest. You know it's not safe." He pauses before walking forward and standing in front of the demon. "Why does your lord want revenge? The cultivators indeed sealed him under a mountain, but that was because he intended to conquer us."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although for once Shen Jiu's words are not malicious but curious, Zhuzhi-lang tenses so sharply that his bonds snap without breaking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Junshang would never!" He hisses, his voice turning to poison. "That lying rat betrayed Junshang! Conquer, you say Master Shen? You cultivators had a chance only because Junshang went with no company other than this one and armed only with a flute."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Zhuzhi-lang's breath grows ragged. Although Shen Yuan doesn’t know what they are discussing, he has vague knowledge thanks to the book to draw some conclusions, but not enough. He gazes at his brother, intrigued by his calm, almost pensive expression. Until he sighs, shaking his head as he rubs the bridge of his nose.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Thank you for your honesty, Zhuzh-lang. This master appreciates it... Because if it weren't for the son of those two being in front of this master, I too would have made the mistake of believing in a story with so many loopholes."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What are you talking about, Jiu-ge?" Shen Yuan frowns, confused.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hearing him, he turns his head to give him a mischievous smirk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You would know if you hadn't missed the meeting."</span>
</p><p>
<span>That's unfair, but also his fault so Shen Yuan lowers his head in shame as he shifts his weight from one foot to the other.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you talking about, Master Shen?” Zhuzhi-lang narrows his eyes suspiciously.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your version of events contradicts the information they received. Lucky for you, this master is cynical enough to question human ambitions. You consider Su Xiyan, Luo Binghe's mother, a treacherous rat. But the Old Palace Master told the cultivators that Tianlang-jun was a threat who planned to conquer us and used his charms to entice a virtuous disciple." Shen Jiu fiddles with his fan. "But no one knows what became of Su Xiyan after Tianlang-jun was sealed under a mountain. And this master is one of the few who was aware that their son was among us listening to everything they said. A child that no one theoretically wanted and has survived despite everything."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shizun."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Until then Shen Yuan has not realized that Luo Binghe is at the entrance of the caves. Darkness covers his features, preventing him from figuring out his expression. Luo Binghe hides his emotions and his voice is so neutral that it is suspicious. Although Shen Yuan hasn’t been to the meeting, he has heard enough to reach certain conclusions. And he can imagine that hearing about his parents hasn't been pleasant for Luo Binghe even if he is acting normal now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Now what, Luo Binghe?" Shen Jiu turns to him, though he is too suspicious not to keep an eye on Zhuzhi-lang.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"When... this one lost control of Xin Mo." His voice sounds embarrassed for a moment before returning to his calm tone. “Even though my thoughts were a mess, the trigger was when the Old Palace Master announced that he would do his best to lock up both shizuns. But when I conquered the Old Palace Master… he was gone. He has been missing for the last few years. I didn't care because both shizuns are more important to me, but now I can't stop thinking about how strange it is. He is the only one who could give us the explanations we want since he was the one who sent Su Xiyan to approach Tianlang-jun.."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Hmm… Sounds suspicious. What do you think, Zhuzhi-lang?" Shen Qingqiu gazes at the demon with a gleam of interest in his eyes. "You can't deny that there is something wrong with that story. Too bad the Old Palace Master has disappeared. This master has a feeling that he might tell us something quite interesting. Luo Binghe?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yes, Shizun?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Send some of your informants to look for clues from the Old Palace Master."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You offend this disciple." Despite the darkness, Shen Yuan recognized the demon's smile. "I've already done it."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Good."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What would shizun want this one to do when he finds the trail of the Old Palace Master?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Whatever you wish. This master has no interest in this matter, and neither do the cultivators." Shen Jiu shrugs. "It's about your origin after all, so it's up to you to choose what to do once you find that coward. It's unusual that he's been missing for years. He knows something, that’s for sure, but demanding the truth or remaining in the dark is not my decision, but yours."</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a nod, Shen Jiu motions for them to leave the cave. Shen Yuan sighs before dragging the wheelchair to the exit. Although he would like to ask Shen Qingqiu and Luo Binghe if they are alright, he remains silent in the end. In the sunlight, the two seem calm as ever.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Well, are you finally going to explain to me what's going on?" He asks his brother.</span>
</p><p>
<span>However, it is the other Shen Qingqiu who responds with an amused snort.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Isn't it obvious? The two of you have baited Zhuzhi-lang. Good strategy." He acknowledges with approval that borders on pride. "You have pointed out the inconsistencies in the story to arouse his curiosity, pointing to a person that you consider suspicious and who is missing. Furthermore, you have clarified that no one else is interested in the truth or will investigate it, but the affected should decide whether they want to find out or not... You didn't force Zhuzhi-lang to investigate what happened to the Old Palace Master, but I wouldn't be surprised if he did it to pay off his debt to Tianlang-jun."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Indeed." Shen Jiu acknowledges. "It's pretty creepy that you can guess my thoughts so easily."</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So...” Shen Yuan cuts them off before the two of them engage in passive-aggressive conversation. "Are you manipulating Zhuzhi-lang into going to find the Old Palace Master? Why?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Because we already have enough facing Luo Bing-ge. This might keep those two out of the conflict, which will be a relief. We couldn't survive so many enemies while a crazy demon tries to merge the two realms. "</span>
</p><p>
<span>"And why haven't you told me anything? I could help you."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"...because you weren't at the meeting."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan clicks his tongue. Even so, as a reader, he has information that could help them better understand the plot.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"And you have no interest in finding out what happened?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because now curiosity burns in his bones after hearing their theories, however, both Shen Jiu and Luo Binghe exchange a look before shrugging.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Not really."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I do." Shen Yuan hands his brother the wheelchair, so abruptly that Shen Qingqiu hisses in protest, and runs off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Using his qi, he speeds across the rainbow bridge while searching for Shang Qinghua. Once he finds him, Shen Yuan grabs his sleeve and drags him away from the other cultivators.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You author!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What do you want? What has happened now?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I never thought I'd tell you this but I need spoilers."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Over the next eight minutes, Shang Qinghua explains another of PIDW's hidden plots.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"YOU FILTHY SNAKE WHO SOLD OUT FOR MONEY. HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO US READERS????? I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU MADE US BELIEVE SHEN QINGQIU DESERVED TO BE CASTRATED WHEN THE ONLY BASTARD WAS THE OLD PALACE MASTER. YOU ROBBED US. GIVE ME BACK MY MONEY AND MY SOUL!!!!!!!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan takes a deep breath to calm down. But with this information, a new plan begins to form in his head. Shen Jiu intends to distract Tianlang-jun and Zhuzhi-lang and get more margin against Luo Bing-ge, however, thanks to this discovery he can try to make them their ally.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I hope you're not hiding anything else from me." He growls, glaring at Shang Qinghua.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"... honestly, I don't remember."</span>

<p>
<span>"I never imagined that you, precisely you, would dare to kidnap me."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Now you're being dramatic."</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh? Then what is your explanation for sneaking me out against my will from Qian Cao Peak in the middle of the night?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>"..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I'm waiting."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I need your help."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Qingqiu snorts, sarcastic and dismissive, at the possibility of someone needing his help.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What have you kidnapped me for?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It's not a kidnapping!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ok, Shen Yuan acknowledges that the situation is a bit fishy and anyone else could draw the wrong conclusions. But that's a decision that Shen Jiu would have approved of, which is quite ironic since he hasn't told anyone, least of all Shen Jiu. But desperate situations call for desperate measures so Shen Yuan continues to drag the wheelchair through the shadows of the sect.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don't talk so loud or you'll alert the disciples on guard."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What's the problem? You don't want them to know you've kidnapped me?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You're being especially irritating today."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Well, I was trying to sleep after a day that hasn't been good." Shen Qingqiu cocks his head. "Oh? Are we visiting Zhuzhi-lang again? Are you that desperate to take his blood from me?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You only got the first part right." Shen Yuan stops. They have arrived at an inhospitable and lonely place in the middle of the Rainbow Bridge. “I have discovered the truth of Su Xiyan and Tianlang-jun using unorthodox methods that I cannot explain to anyone. In the end, Jiu-ge was right to blame the Old Palace Master and with my new information, I know that Tianlang- Jun will want revenge once he finds out what really happened."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Although this master is a genius, I cannot understand why you have disturbed my sleep."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I have various problems: First, Tianlang-jun must believe me even though I have no proof to show him. Second, we are not interested in him taking revenge on the Old Palace Master, but in helping us protect our world. You are like Jiu-ge."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"More precisely: we are the same person. Keep talking."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"With your negotiating skills, I trust that you will be able to use the information I will give you to convince Tianlang-jun to help us against Luo Bing-ge."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You want me to blackmail Tianlang-jun."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"That's another way of putting it."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Fine." Shen Qingqiu smiles like a devious cat. "What's in it for me?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What? I'm not stupid, Yuan-di. You're asking me for my help because my other self will never support such a risky plan involving another powerful demon whose interests are closer to Luo Bing-ge's than yours. However, I’m desperate, I’m flattered that you offer me a challenge instead of letting me rot like a plant, and it will always be a pleasure to oppose my other self. And you are aware of my price."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You know I can't make you grow arms or legs but if you help me I'll use my knowledge to get your body back."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Meanwhile, you will be the one to take me everywhere I want."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Fine."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You will be my arms and legs, I don't want anyone else to come near me."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Fine."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"And..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Ok, don't be so demanding. You have to show me your skills first."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Yuan guides the wheelchair towards the Lingxi Caves as he thinks of how to explain to Shen Jiu that he is about to release Zhuzhi-lang to make a pact with the devil.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>The next morning, Shen Jiu doesn’t find Shen Yuan in the bamboo house, but a cowardly written note. He is reading it sitting at the low table while he drinks tea when the door is flung open. Liu Qingge bursts in with the same manners as a wild animal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shen Jiu! Shen Qingqiu has..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Missing from Qian Cao Peak? I know." He sips tea without paying attention to him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu doesn't react even when the door is flung open again and Luo Binghe appears.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shizun! This disciple has gone to the Lingxi Caves and..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Zhuzhi-lang has disappeared? I know." His calm is tense and borders on rage.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The door swings open a third time, with determination instead of violence, and Yue Qingyuan arrives just as anxious and overwhelmed as the rest. Shen Jiu snorts in annoyance before slamming the table as he puts down the letter and turns to face them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“In case you come to inform me that neither Shen Qingqiu is at Qian Cao Peak nor Zhuzhi-lang at Lingxi Caves, I must warn you that I already know. He left a note."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"SHEN YUAN HAS DONE WHAT!?" Liu Qingge and Luo Binghe yell in unison, sharing the same panic.</span>
</p><p>
<span>However, Yue Qingyuan just turns pale as he looks at Shen Qingqiu.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No… I… I didn't know about this."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu frowns and a faint concern begins to spread across his chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Then why have you come?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"There is intense demonic activity on Maigu Ridge. Luo Bing-ge has finally appeared."</span>
</p><p>
<span>After feeling overwhelmed, frustrated, and scared while reading Shen Yuan's letter, he believed that nothing would surprise him today. But the threat of his worst enemy envelops him in dense, suffocating darkness that leaves him breathless. Shen Jiu's hand trembles, though he manages to set the teacup down before he drops it on the floor.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We should get ready then." Cang Qiong Mountain Sect's strategist says as he sits up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What about Shen Yuan?" Luo Binghe stammers with an attitude more befitting the disciple he once was than the Demon Lord he has become.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I DON'T KNOW!" An overwhelmed older brother screams.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shen Jiu closes his eyes and takes a deep breath in a desperate attempt to regain control that has been shattered in an instant. Someone approaches him. Shen Jiu hears footsteps and the creak of fabric, perhaps from an arm that wants to get closer to him but doesn't dare.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I want to trust Shen Yuan…” He confesses, ducking his head towards the note in which he has explained his plan. "But I don’t know what to do."</span>
</p><p>
<span>What is more important? Lead his sect in a showdown against an enemy capable of destroying the world, or search for his brother before he makes a mistake? Shen Jiu is startled when Luo Binghe hugs him from behind. It is an impulsive hug, firm at first, then ashamed to understand what has happened. But it is a warm and comforting gesture, and Shen Jiu allows him to stay instead of pushing him away from him. With much more embarrassment, Liu Qingge finishes reaching out and squeezes his hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Maybe he doesn't have the best answer, but at least he's not alone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then someone timidly knocks on the door, startling the three of them to Yue Qingyuan's relief.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Sorry to disturb you." Says an unknown voice. Turning around, they discover a disciple from And Ding Peak. "We didn't find shizun. Could Shen-shibo help us?"</span>

<p>
<span>Maigu Ridge is trembling wrapped in smoke and fire. Perhaps it is because he has escaped from Xin Mo's influence, but Luo Binghe considers the merging of both realms an aberration. His heart trembles with overwhelm and horror, also with the guilt of recognizing himself in that decision. Luo Binghe stands aloof from the rest of the cultivators while gazing at Maigu Ridge's death rattles as his determination becomes firmer. Indecision keeps the virtuous sects across the river, though not for long.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And he takes this opportunity to disappear without saying anything to anyone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Luo Binghe advances towards Maigu Ridge, he becomes more aware that the calamity that is shaking the world is not Xin Mo's fault, but a very conscious whim. And the worst thing is that Luo Binghe can understand his counterpart. In other circumstances, he would have done the same. In the past, he also did worse things that he only regretted some of. Accepting his selfishness leaves a bitter taste in his mouth, but it's not enough to stop him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Once out of the prying ears of the cultivators, Luo Binghe summons Sha Hualing and Mobei-jun and sends the two of them to guard the perimeter along with their demon host. They nod and disappear to carry out his orders. Luo Binghe flashes a lopsided smile before walking into Maigu Ridge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The heat is intolerable. The seal on his forehead glows a color as violent and red as freshly spilled blood. It reflects his determination. Luo Binghe walks with the certainty of being the most powerful demon in this dimension and the murderous desire to destroy the most powerful demon in the other dimension. After an eternity wandering between corridors carved into the rock, he finds his other self.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Bing-ge looks at him with a mocking face that doesn't hide his disappointment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You are not shizun." He points out. "None of the three. Where are they?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe gives him a crooked, acidic smirk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Haven't you noticed? Shizun chose his brother, not you. None of them are here. Now what will you do?" He steps forward and his confidence erodes his counterpart's arrogance. "If you persist in merging the two realms, there will be no shizun left. You will return to your world alone and the weight of that loneliness will be with you for all eternity."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shut up." Luo Bing-ge glares at him with a face livid with anger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You will always be aware that none of the three shizun chose you. You are not so important to any of them."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"SHUT UP!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe allows him to land a punch that almost breaks his jaw. He didn't even try to dodge, but nonchalantly accepted the blow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We can fight, but I've already won. And do you know why? Because shizun has trusted me to stop you."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What a joke!" His eyes flash with murderous laughter as he draws Xin Mo and points his blade at him. "With what sword?" Luo Binghe responds by unsheathing his own and his enemy bursts into roaring laughter. "Zheng Yang? No sword can rival Xin Mo, much less one that breaks so easily."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"My sword is better than yours." Luo Binghe shrugs. He feels strangely calm despite the fact that the atmosphere has become even darker and more suffocating. "It doesn't get into my head or whisper harmful ideas to me. Besides, it's the sword that shizun arranged for me. If I wanted, I could get my Xin Mo back. But no matter how much you want it, you will never have a Zheng Yang. "</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Bing-ge pales. He has begun to tremble, perhaps from envy, perhaps from rage. Luo Binghe feels a laugh stuck in his throat. His other self is older and more confident than him, more dangerous and powerful. And yet, getting under his skin is very easy. Beneath that facade are many scars and festering wounds that have never healed. That was why he wanted any Shen Qingqiu so much.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I'm going to return you to your distorted world." Luo Binghe growls like an animal ready to protect his home. "I don't mind breaking all your bones if it takes to get there. You'll crawl back to that hideous palace of yours and I'll go back to mine." This time, Luo Binghe does dodge the attack of his other self. "I'll take a relaxing aromatic bath and maybe get some sleep. Only when I've washed off the dirt and blood, I’ll go back to Qing Jing Peak. Because unlike you, I still have a sect to return to." He adds mischievously, causing Luo Bing-ge to grit his teeth furiously. "I will go into shizun's house and prepare one of my favorite recipes. Do you still remember the dishes that mom prepared for us? The ones we learned with her? The ones we dreamed of making for a special person? I will make them for all my shizuns. And also Liu-shishu, although I'm not so sure if he will dare to taste them."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe pauses to dodge the merciless blows of his enemy's sword, which swings viciously hungry for his blood. As the two swords collide, Zheng Yang groans in a metallic hiss, and Luo Binghe takes a deep breath before spinning the sword, preventing Luo Bing-ge from breaking it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It will be a great party. Perhaps one of the shizuns invites the rest of the sect: surely our martial brothers and maybe some martial uncles and aunts. We will all be alive and happy celebrating your defeat. As a family. Because I’m still a part of that family. And when night falls... I don't know what will happen. I suspect that this time shizun will prevent me from going to Liu-shishu's house."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Bing-ge releases a miasma of resentment that accompanies his next more fierce and desperate attacks. Luo Binghe dodges them with difficulty and the first blows manage to tear his clothes and hurt his arms and legs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Well, Bing-di." The demon hisses as rage darkens his features. "We've already heard of your dream. Do you know what mine is? I'm going to destroy you. I'm going to break every bone, every tendon, every joint. I'm going to break that annoying sword of yours. I'm going to drag your shattered body and you will see how I murder all those pathetic cultivators. There will be no more Qing Jing Peak, there will be no more Cang Qiong Mountain Sect. And then I will hunt down shizun while destroying this world."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Still dont you see it?" Luo Binghe laughs maniacally despite Xin Mo sinking into his shoulder. "You're so piteous that you only know how to destroy! That's so easy... and boring... You're a pathetic monster who can't keep anything. You couldn't save our mother or earn shizun's appreciation. Even Ning Yingying, who has always been with us, has run away from you!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"SHUT UP!!!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>The sword sinks in further, shattering the joint and muscle, but Luo Binghe can't stop laughing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"When you wake up every day in your shitty palace and see the world you've destroyed, do you regret your mistakes or don't you care anymore?" The sword makes an unpleasant noise as it leaves his body. "It's so ironic! Why don't you laugh? You wanted both the demon realm and the human realm and you don't have either. It's funny, don't you think? To have become the emperor of nothing..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe clumsily dodges the sword aimed at his heart. Despite his instant regeneration, Xin Mo's wounds are cursed and not even his blood is capable of healing itself. But he doesn’t care. He will have won while he is still laughing and his other self trembles with rage.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Why don't you recognize it, Bing-ge?" He addresses him mockingly. "You even pretended to be me. I have won since the moment you yearned for my life. That's why fighting with you is a waste of time." He drops the sword. He is too tired to fight anyway and it will be a loss if Luo Bing-ge manages to break Zheng Yang. "And you know I'm right. That's why you hate me."</span>
</p><p>
<span>The truth hurts more than a stab wound. Luo Binghe clings to a bloody smile as he recognizes confusion on his enemy's face that twists into rage that turns to envy that taints into cruelty.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I'll kill you."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Sure?" Luo Binghe walks towards him with clumsy but steady steps. "What is it now? Do you want to kill me and occupy my life? At least acknowledge that I have everything you want."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You got it." Luo Bing-ge hisses as a maniacal gleam lights up his eyes. "And I don't understand how such a pathetic version of me has been so lucky."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Are you sure who is the pathetic of the two of us?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Bing-ge grabs his neck with one hand. His response is violent and direct, it leaves him breathless and prevents him from saying anything else. The demon doesn’t hesitate to stab him with the sword. Xin Mo pierces through his chest and the point emerges from his back after ripping organs and tissue. Luo Binghe vomits a waterfall of blood that soaks his other self's sleeve and his face. Although his vision is blurring, he still distinguishes perfectly the crazy eyes of someone who is almost his reflection. A distorted, selfish and cruel reflection, who has long since been lost in an abyss from which he has never been able to escape.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Even when death clings to his body with icy fingers, Luo Binghe knows that as long as his other self drags those memories he can never win.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He's lost in those red eyes, the only thing he can see, and he doesn't notice the blood splattering on him or the demon's expression of confused astonishment. Until his claw releases his neck and Xin Mo leaves his body, replying against the ground. Now the two are identical: another sword pierces Luo Bing-ge from behind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Neither of them expected Liu Qingge in their particular duel.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The War God hits the demon's back with a kick before drawing his sword. Luo Bing-ge tries to turn and stab him with Xin Mo, but Cheng Luan is faster and slashes his throat. His blood oozes out and stains his fingers as Luo Binghe puts a hand to the wound. His regenerative abilities protect him, but they don't stop Liu Qingge from punching him in the face and then plunging his sword into the same shoulder that he shattered Luo Binghe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe does not feel any satisfaction at seeing his other self so hurt, rather an immense weariness. He closes his eyes and staggers before losing consciousness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment, he is not aware of what is happening. There are screams and noises, then silence. Someone grabs him and nice, clear qi runs through his body, repairing Xin Mo's wounds. Luo Binghe groans in pain before opening his eyes. In that blurry world, Liu Qingge's figure shines white and perfect.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What happened?" He stammers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"He is gone."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe doesn't dare to ask if his other self is dead or if he has slipped away to his world. Internally, he wants his counterpart to forget and start a new life. No more capricious wishes. No more destruction to erase everything that hurts him. No more unnecessary cruelty.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liu Qingge holds him so tightly, digging his fingers into his flesh, that it's annoying and his qi heals him just as aggressively. Luo Binghe protests.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It hurts, Liu-shishu..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What were you thinking, idiot!?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Perhaps... I made a mistake..."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"If you're so desperate to die, tell me and I'll make your wish come true without compromising the rest of the world."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luo Binghe flashes a huge bloodstained smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Were you worried about me, Liu-shishu?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shen Jiu told me to watch you when he went after Shen Yuan."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh, that's even better." He takes a deep breath. "Thank you."</span>
</p><p>
<span>And the protagonist of this absurd story, who only wanted the love of the villain, closes his eyes before losing consciousness.</span>

<p>Chapter End Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>The day I said "Yey! I'm going to write my most self-indulgent ff!" I never imagined that I would end up writing a ff of more than 170k words. This trip has been crazy and it wouldn't have been the same without all your support. Thanks for the encouragement, the jokes, and the constant support. Without your feedback, I wouldn't have found the strength to write so much.</p><p>Before anyone wants to kill the author for this abrupt ending... Do you remember what I said a few chapters ago about the endgame of the fic? Well, it's time to reveal what it is. I told you that I wanted to give you a gift for all your support, so... It's time for the big surprise!</p><p>The main story ends here, but there is still the epilogue. Or epilogues.</p><p><b>You are going to vote for your favorite endgame</b>. And I will write different epilogues according to the results. To make it clearer, I will give an example: epilogue A is Liushen, B is Bingjiu, C is Liujiu, D is Bingliu. The four epilogues are canon, but independent... You know, different realities! :D Here the timeline splits and anything is possible. In addition to the endgame, the epilogues will explain the pending subplots.</p><p><b>How do you vote?</b><br/>You have to comment with a top 5. Example:<br/>5. Liujiu, Bingqiu (my favorite option, so I give them 5 points)<br/>4. Bingjiu, Liushen<br/>3. Zhuzhi-langxOrShen Qingqiu<br/>2. Bingliujiu<br/>1. Bingliushen (my least favorite opinion, so I only give them 1 point)</p><p>(it's just an example, you can vote for your favorite ships!)</p><p>I will add the points to write the most popular epilogues. You don't have to give five ships and you can even give all your favorite ships 5 and 4 points. Of course, I will ignore the ships that haven't been relevant in history... (yup, not romantic shencest or qijiu, sorry ^^'). You can also vote for a non-romance epilogue of Shen brothers being together!</p><p><u>The voting will be until August 15</u>.</p><p>I hope you like the idea and you have enjoyed the chapter &lt;3</p><p>(I'm going to publish this running and I'm going to work. If you have any doubt, comment it and later I will solve it)</p><p>――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――</p><p>★ <a href="https://twitter.com/FakeAlice8" rel="nofollow">Twitter</a></p></blockquote>
