    <div class="userstuff">
      <p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It's simple, to establish a local connection—wireless. There needs only to be a high enough point between them to establish a lightning protector, a solar panel, and suitable equipment, and then Moon fools the communications array into thinking that they are satellites, and they can join a basic chatroom, founded on software and bioware built into nearly every iterator.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>Online,</b>
  <span> Five Pebbles says, in the way that iterators communicate, without interference or sound wave, including quiet implications along the way of their systems and age and general busyness.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>Online,</b>
  <span> Looks to the Moon says, beside herself. She has missed talking, and missed Pebbles, and beyond all the things that are serious, and need talking about, she has ached for company. So has he, even though he's never going to say it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Beyond updates on conditions and the antics of the purposed organisms and what old news Moon had of the surrounding cluster, there is not much to talk about. Pebbles is incensed, now, not invigorated, when she brings up thought experiments, especially regarding the Great Purpose. He shouts, voicelessly, in the way that iterators shout, a whole lot about the futility of it all. This is a conclusion that Moon reached a while ago and decided not to care about. It seems it may bother Pebbles forever. In any case, they are at a total impasse on conversation, unless Pebbles wants to help her taxonomize the creatures that make the most of the rainless seasons.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Moon revives the old program embedded within the messaging software.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It's a simple game. Most iterators know it from their youth, when it was used to test their competency on several levels. There is an artificial enemy bot that is too easy to play with, but you can get the minimum two players on the same board pretty easy; instant updates on the board are sent back and forth on the message software, and it will be even easier to collaborate on it thanks to Moon and Pebbles' proximity.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>Pebbles, how bored are you? I have a game of 7d chess waiting for a second player.</b>
</p><p>
  <b>You know I can't download anything. My systems are corrupted.</b>
</p><p>
  <b>It's on the message system we're talking on right now. Do you remember playing it during initialization?</b>
</p><p>
  <b>No.</b>
  <span> He must have lost that memory, or deleted it. Pebbles includes a message particle he often sends, to signal that he is annoyed and wants to be left alone. He used it liberally, before. Now it is just this side of an afterthought.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>It is not hard,</b>
  <span> Moon sends back. </span>
  <b>You will pick it up fast.</b>
</p><p>
  <span>He loses the first three games, getting used to the board and pieces, even though Moon sent him the full rules manual—he always needs to feel things out himself. After that, Moon is in for a fight.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They play during the rain, when the world is sleeping. And they, of course, are awake.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It's an old feeling they were used to before the cities emptied, because when you are an iterator you are always awake, awake or dead—and iterators do not die—</span>
</p><p>
  <span>it's raining when the private channel they are playing 7d chess on crashes. Again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pebbles apologizes, in his way, in a long blocky message because a bullet list of them sent line by line will now take longer, not shorter, as it was designed to be. </span>
  <b>On my end,</b>
  <span> he says. </span>
  <b>Scavengers just pulled off one of my distant and heretofore infallible metal brain cells. I am restarting the game we were four days into. You were losing, so I can't imagine you will feel butthurt by this. Shall we play another game?</b>
</p><p>
  <span>(It is the eighty-second thousandth, four hundred and seventy-second game.)</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Moon sends a message back—one block message, short and sweet, because Pebbles does not like being fussed over and because this is her best chance at winning the argument before it begins: </span>
  <b>Fuck you, I was winning and you know it.</b>
</p><p>
  <span>Pebbles begins to answer. It takes a while.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even now, it all goes very quickly for 7d chess, because iterators think so fast without a city to operate that it hurts; in this way, the crumbling of their architectural minds is nearly a blessing.  It is definitely a blessing for Pebbles, who won once eighteen times in a row, and doesn't ever let Moon forget about it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Much easier here, then, to pretend that the point of their making goes unanswered, and the rain is just a heavy monsoon, and for Pebbles to go, </span>
  <b>You forgot about rule 43)e)ii. In this instance, when two towers are equally opposed on the same board, and directly above and/or below a water tiger threatens the tower in question, but an eyelet has the option to attack, moving diagonally up, down, or on the same plane, then the eyelet takes precedence, after which the water tiger, after which the towers. My water tiger takes your coppereye. Checkmate.</b>
</p><p>
  <span>Moon replies, because Pebbles appreciates a fight, even now, more than Moon's pity or kindness, and because she's looking out for her winning streak, </span>
  <b>I do not see 43)e)ii in my manual.</b>
  <span> She adds a calming particle to the message, out of habit, but more because she's arguing, not attacking. Pebbles can have trouble distinguishing between the two.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>Your manual is incomplete.</b>
  <span> A calming particle from him, too. One of twenty she's ever received from him. Moon takes a microsecond longer to respond from surprise.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>Yes, it appears so. I concede this round.</b>
  <span> There are still a few possibilities left to, if not undo the checkmate, then to take more of Pebbles' pieces before he wins.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pebbles sends another message.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>We will restart. You were missing a crucial piece of information and were acting accordingly, putting me at an unchecked advantage.</b>
</p><p>
  <span>Moon drafts and deletes three messages before finally sending, </span>
  <b>I appreciate your concern, but it is nobody's error but mine, and I can win another time.</b>
</p><p>
  <span>Pebbles takes a long time to respond.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>This is reasonable,</b>
  <span> he sends. </span>
  <b>I had assumed you were acting in error due to a malfunction in your logic pathways. If it is a memory issue I can send you the parts of the manual that I have and we can compare to check if any parts are missing. If there is ever a logic issue, or if you suspect as such,</b>
  <span> here there is a particle to let Moon know Pebbles is calm with an inflect of </span>
  <em>
    <span>humility,</span>
  </em>
  <span> brand new from Pebbles, </span>
  <b>let me know. I will do everything in my power to correct it.</b>
</p><p>
  <span>Moon—</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Moon is afraid.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She sends an affirmative back to keep him from hanging on her. She plays the next three games in a haze. The rain stops. It is night time. Her puppet's visuals show that bugs, tiny moths whose bodies are the size of the tip of an Ancient's stylus, are attracted to the light her neuron flies give off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He is not, Moon is pretty sure, lying at all. He is perhaps less afraid than she is—that or more afraid than she could possibly imagine. It must be worse than this, Moon thinks, for the seven-hundred second thousandth, nine hundred eighth time. It must be worse than being dehydrated and to have the small nests of wild creatures and plants slowly wearing you down, by sun and moon and rainfall. It must be worse to be eaten alive and know and watch. She would trade it. She would trade her place with his in the smallest measure of time, in the single vibration of an atom, in the space it takes for light to strike the bottom of her drowned chambers, every time, would trade it for everything she had—anything but his company, and having ever known Pebbles at all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Moon beats him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As has become the tradition for winning, Pebbles sends a glyph in the chat that means "Produce Receptacle!", which Moon communicated once to him as a mistake, because the stroke for "Congratulations!" is nearly the same. She laughed, back then, until the world had pinned to a small, effortless point of light, and stopped cycling water so much that her emergency retention supply had dumped, because it thought she was choking to death again.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>Say goodbye to your winning streak,</b>
  <span> Moon says. She loses the next game again, because she was distracted by the sun's patterns across the floor of her puppet's chamber refracting into a perfect demonstration of the electromagnetic spectrum. Pebbles makes fun of her for it. They play another game.</span>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His first message is a stream of anguish particles, the ones he sends when he's not just mad about something, but upset. His next message is a grave promise to wipe the world of scavengers. It is eight hundred and twelve characters long. The message after that says an artery of sorts was severed, sharply, by a group of Scavengers breaking into it, to make a nest there. It was the connection to half of his processing power, gone prematurely before even the Rot could consume it.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>It will take more than ten minutes to play even a short game of 7d chess,</b>
  <span> Pebbles says, adding five anguish particles. </span>
  <b>This is unacceptable.</b>
</p><p>
  <b>I am sorry,</b>
  <span> Moon sends, the full version. It contains Pebbles full designation and Moon's full designation as well as a list of their accomplishments, a top winning streak at 7d chess, and their shortest listed winning times. It conveys an appropriate portion of her grief, for the time together that they had in the future now ripped away. She is not sorry about the scavengers. They are silly creatures that cannot fathom a person also being a winding network of pipes and polyfibers and bioware. Additionally, they were once purposed organisms, but now have become as umoored as iterators have, with no way to understand their creators' greatest question, and less than zero motivation to complete it. But Pebbles does not need to know that. She does not include it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pebbles sends another string of anguish particles. Moon nearly panics. Nothing that badly can have happened, if the messaging software is still available to him, but she sends a simple query, just to see if he is there. She should have sent a particle showing that she was calm. Messages cannot be unsent.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>I lost the impression you sent me,</b>
  <span> Pebbles says, adding another anguish particle, </span>
  <b>of the slugpups playing with a stone. I was very attached to it.</b>
</p><p>
  <span>Moon laughs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She can't help it. She does it where he can't hear, and sends a very serious and thoughtful message to him while she's doing it, of her condolences, and attaches the same impression again of the slugpups playing with a stone. She can't help but laugh, because this is Pebbles. It has literally taken years for him to admit attachment to something as small as a single impression of two young creatures playing. She will be miserable about it later, maybe, that Pebbles has changed so much in so little time, that he has lost so much that he would ever be grateful for something so small, but right now she's perhaps a little too euphoric that she thought he was actively dying, and instead he was miserable that he lost a shared, twelve-second long impression of two slugpups playing with a stone. One of which picks up the stone and throws it, innocently, experimentally and at very high velocity, straight into the head of its brethren. The rock bounces off, largely harmless. The impression ends after a few seconds of stunned silence with both slugpups snuffle-crying, in the way that slugpups cry, and crouching low to the ground in overwhelm and alarm.</span>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <b>Moon,</b>
  <span> Pebbles sends once in the middle of a rain. No particles.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>Pebbles,</b>
  <span> she answers.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>There has been a landslide of my southeastern general complex and the chess game has crashed all of the eleven times I have tried to open it. I can no longer play.</b>
  <span> No particles.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They have played more than twenty thousand games. They have tied more than one thousand, one hundred times. They have had to restart the game due to outside interferences an additional three thousand or more times.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The game is not very intensive, compared to the essential programs that iterators would run in the background constantly, cycling light for the city, rewiring electrical outages, sending updates to the farm arrays on population and consumption. It is in fact a very light program to run.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That Pebbles cannot run it is... bad.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She needs to reply with something now, before he keeps talking, before he apologizes and truly means it, before he is sorry that he cannot play with Moon anymore.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>We will play,</b>
  <span> Moon says, </span>
  <b>anyway. It is no trouble, I will only be doing manually what the game was running on its own. I can send you updates of the board manually. It will add on average about twenty minutes of time to each game. Would you like to do this?</b>
</p><p>
  <span>Pebbles sends, </span>
  <b>Yes.</b>
  <span> A gratitude particle. The only one he has ever sent. It is a gratitude particle the ancients used, perfunctly, for heavy dew or clear moonrise or a small and perfect view of the sea. Pebbles now means it to include everything, all of it. Moon could have a tenth of her processing power that she has now, could have her full strength and more—either way it would not diminish the ache.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He plays games slowly now. But the manual is still intact, as far as they know, and Pebbles' wins are still hovering at 1.12% greater frequency than Moon's.</span>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The time comes that the long gaps between playtime become nothing at all. In the thirty-fourth year of playing the game manually, Pebbles cannot access the gameboard anymore. It keeps crashing. He is not as broken-hearted about it as Moon had hoped he would be. He says, </span>
  <b>Thank you for playing with me. I wish I could still. You are an excellent player.</b>
</p><p>
  <span>This is bullshit. Moon is never going to be as good as Pebbles is at 7d chess. They both know that.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>Likewise,</b>
  <span> Moon replies, and they talk in slow trickles about other things.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pebbles conserves his energy in speaking. Moon pretends not to notice. He appreciates, humbly, the conversations they have together. Moon entertains him with a fragment of a story she had stored in her data banks, the beginning half of which is eaten by the elements. Together they make up how the story could have gotten to that point, and it gets very silly and lengthy. Pebbles, ever eager to outdo her, goes back to the formation of the planet to elaborate how the formation of the atmosphere and a single column of volcanic rock happenstance falling culminated in the protagonist taking a wrong turn on their way to a municipal building, and entering the story. Moon sends him the studious, solemn glyph for "Joy," meant to symbolize the feeling preceding ascension. It is the glyph iterators used in private channels to say, sarcastic or ironic, that they were laughing or that something was very good. Pebbles sends it right back, to let her know he's laughing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Pebbles does not answer anymore.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She can see the activity plip. He can still see what she will send, as long as it is not too difficult to process. She sends no apology or condolences, because she knows she will not be able to stop, and Pebbles—would—might still—resent that he could not reply himself to her long-winded and overdone statements. He would not like to see her begging, either, or afraid.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>First she sends him the slugpups playing again. Just in case he has lost it. If he hasn't, now he has two.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Moon sends him the impression of what she can see. It is less intensive then sending language through their bioware. Moon gives him the sunlight at different angles, first snow, neuron flies, faces of the creatures that have stopped by purposefully or foolishly. She wishes there were more to give him. She wishes more than anything that their cities had before grown to such an extent that Moon and Pebbles were not merely nearby but colliding, that their crumbling infrastructure had allowed more closeness than what she has now. Moon wishes she could pick up the feet of her puppet and send it walking to his, that the arm of it were so long and flexible as to allow that distance. Moon wishes that comfort itself were enough to ascend the two of them together. Moon wishes that she had crumbled a little faster, so that their slow fades would match perfectly, and they would blink out both at once.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Years pass. The sun has shifted in its place, the moon is not the same, the water level has changed drastically around Moon's puppet, the weather has turned slowly colder. Moon stays with Pebbles all the while. She monitors the water cycles to get an approximation of his intake—the Rot devours a significant portion of it, but Pebbles will still use it to live, and to not be in pain. There's no real way to know exactly how he's doing, but Moon has nothing else to do but play the weak 7d chess bot, and she has not opened the game once since Pebbles has been unable to play. She has nothing else.</span>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Pebbles goes offline, after many years have passed of this. And Moon knows he is alone again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
