<div class="userstuff">
<p>It was a perfectly normal day, when the shipment finally arrived. A mess of archival errors, improperly filled out forms, release notices, fees and such having delayed this particular package for almost twenty years.</p><p>After Kaveh’s father—<em>After Kaveh’s father and everything that entails,</em> his belongings at his offices in the Akademiya were all tidied away. When his body was recovered in the desert, those belongings were added to the pile too. The problem was that they had gotten lost in a mess of paperwork, release forms, so on and so forth.</p><p>None of this was helped by the fact that all of his father’s possessions had inexplicably…well.<em> Unexplained themselves.</em></p><p>All of the old sketches and kamera photographs went blank, their details shifting, melting, refusing to be seen under any angle by anyone. All of his father’s journals and notebooks slammed themselves shut. You couldn’t pry them open with a crowbar if you were foolish enough to take metal up against paper. All of the loose leaf pages of various notes, messages, letters, and sketches seemed to just…dissolve. The ink would run as though fresh, sliding along within the boundaries of the page or evaporating away until the paper was blank so long as someone was looking at them directly. But then once whatever poor sop was in charge of trying to sort out his father’s belongings looked away again, the papers would be exactly as his father left them.</p><p>Kaveh doesn’t blame whoever was trying to sort that out for letting it sit on the back-burner. How could he? What are you supposed to do to verify documents that can’t be read? Not through lack of fluency or skill, but simply because the documents themselves outright <em>refused</em> to be understood?</p><p>Does it make Kaveh any less resentful? <em>No</em>. But he can’t exactly put blame on someone for being literally unable to read something when the letters are fighting back.</p><p>Almost twenty years. It took the Akademiya almost twenty years to sort it out because of the changeover in employees, the mess of the Akasha system going down and erasing all of the notes that were taken on his father’s belongings, so on and so forth. The box with his father’s things in it was apparently forgotten and labeled as UNKNOWN OWNERSHIP and tucked away in a Rtawawhist storage room. Then by some miracle of happenstance, someone glanced at one of the photographs on top of the box (not long enough for the strangeness of the documents to melt their contents, but just long enough to catch a glimpse of a suggestion of a shape) and said, “Hey, doesn’t that look like Master Faranak? What’s a Kshahrewar box doing in here?” And that launched a chain of events leading to Kaveh having a giant box full of documents that he can’t read either.</p><p>And Kaveh has tried. He can’t open any of these books. The pages don’t exactly melt away before his eyes, but the letters seem to scramble around until he feels like being sick. The photographs don’t disappear entirely but they blur something awful until they’re just messes of sepia brown.</p><p>Kaveh has gone to every single document expert in Sumeru, private and Akademiya-employed to no success. The best he’d ever gotten someone to say was that they might be able to crack one of the books open, at risk of damaging the contents, with no guarantee of whether or not whatever was inside would be legible. No one could explain what mechanism or manner of magic was causing all of his father’s belongings to behave so erratically. </p><p>(Although several people asked if—<em>if</em> Kaveh ever sorted it out—they could study the mechanism for widespread use. Quite understandably, this would be a game changer for securities and an entire revelation for the Haravatat darshan.)</p><p>There was, however, <em>one</em> thing that everyone he brought the box of his father to could agree on with confidence.</p><p>“If there is anyone who could figure it out, it’s the Grand Scribe. I can send you a referral note, if you like.”</p><p>Kaveh’s gotten referrals to Al-Haitham out of every mouth and he’s gone down the entire list of masters in the field. There’s no one else to ask.</p><p>And <em>oh</em>, does Kaveh <em>hate</em> to ask. But he has to at this point. He <em>must</em>.</p><p>Almost twenty years of waiting. Kaveh wants to get this over with so he can do a quick flip-through of the contents to verify that it really is his father’s, then ship it all off to Fontaine. His mother deserves these things. His mother deserves the final piece of resolution to her grief. Sure she’s mostly gotten over it. Probably. Remarried, started anew. But he knows it haunts her still. Lingers. It’s part of why she can’t come back to Sumeru. He wants her to have this peace. He wants her to have back the pieces of the man she loved and mourned so deeply it caused her to have to leave an entire life behind.</p><p>Kaveh hefts the box in his arms, feeling stupid as he stands in front of Al-Haitham’s closed study door. If there were anyone else…even abroad. Kaveh had even asked Cyno to ask his sister in Mondstadt if she could help.</p><p>“You have,” Cyno said flatly unimpressed, “one of Teyvat’s foremost experts on book restoration and cypher breaking living under the same roof as you. And you want to send these books—your father’s books, which you only recently got back after a mess of paperwork caused them to get lost for almost twenty years—to Mondstadt. Lisa is a librarian and she has a vast expertise in handling rare and unusually temperamental books. But it is not her primary field of study. She’s a Spantamad as I. You have a Haravatat sleeping across the hallway from you and you’d rather put this in the hands of a chemist.”</p><p>Of course, when Cyno put it like that it sounded like utter lunacy. But this was not just any Haravatat scholar, master. This was not just any book restorer or cypher breaker. If it was, Kaveh wouldn’t hesitate. Instead this was, is, Al-Haitham and everything that the name entails which is far more than just professional expertise and accolades.</p><p>Cyno, sensing Kaveh’s apprehension to outright abhorrence of the idea, swiftly changed tack and said, “What’s more important to you? Unlocking your father’s memory or your pride?”</p><p>“Must you,” Kaveh grit his teeth, “be so ruthlessly reasonable? Fine. I’ll…ask.”</p><p>So now here’s Kaveh, stomach turning itself into knots, jaw already tense enough to hurt, standing in front of Al-Haitham’s closed door as the faint sounds of music slip through from the spin-crystal player. On one hand, what’s the harm in just asking? The worst Al-Haitham could do is say no, which is what everyone else has already said. Besides…maybe Al-Haitham won’t be such a bastard about it. He helped during the Inter-Darshan competition, in a way. It was Al-Haitham who initially brought some form of resolution to Kaveh and his mother. Since then they’ve been talking more without the arguing. They’ve been worse to each other over more intimate-to-the-soul things.</p><p>On the other hand. They’ve <em>definitely</em> been worse. With the things that they had unwittingly and unconsciously given each other over the years to hurt each other with, they had already done each other more than enough damage and grief. It’s Al-Haitham. It’s Kaveh. No one ever knows what’s going to happen when it comes to them. Sometimes Kaveh doesn’t think even <em>they</em> know what they’re doing when it comes to the other. Something gets lost in translation as it leaves one of their mouths and slashes across the other’s ears. They find new ways to be worse all without ever even trying.</p><p>Kaveh knocks.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“It’s me.”</p><p>“Who else? Enter.”</p><p>Kaveh pushes the door open. Al-Haitham is at his desk, which is—for once—clear. It looks like he’s reading. At a glance Kaveh can’t tell what the book is about. He doesn’t get more than a glance because Al-Haitham glances up at him, snaps the book shut and sets it aside.</p><p>“Ah, so you’re finally done wasting your time running around with the second-rate.”</p><p>At least Kaveh doesn’t have to say what he’s here for. There’s one small humiliation out of several out of the way. Kaveh places the box on the top of the shelf underneath the windowsill. “Make no mistake, I’m not here because I want to be. I’m here because you’re the last person left in the country to ask. What’s it going to cost me?”</p><p>“You assume I’ll take the job.” Al-Haitham stands, walking over to join him, arms crossed as Kaveh opens the box to reveal the indecipherable contents within. </p><p>“You know what this is and you know what it is to me. Don’t play around with me,” Kaveh snaps, hands flexing at his sides. “If you’re not going to do it just say so.”</p><p>Al-Haitham shoots him a sharp look, mouth turning down at the corner. “I didn’t say I<em> wasn’t</em> going to do it. I simply observed that you assumed I would take the job.”</p><p>Kaveh has to remind himself that grinding his teeth is a bad habit and also an unhealthy one.</p><p>“So are you or aren’t you?”</p><p>“My private commissions cost more than you could afford even if I gave you any form of discount, and I doubt you’d want these submitted as public record for me to review as Grand Scribe of the Akademiya. Even if you were willing, unless you bribed your way through every official in charge, my work-slots are full up until next year.”</p><p>Kaveh knows this. He’ll take out another loan with Dori if he has to though. This is important. It’s his <em>father</em>. It’s his <em>mother</em>. Kaveh opens his mouth to say this but Al-Haitham continues, leaning forward to examine the contents of the box.</p><p>“I don’t want your money. I have something else in mind.”</p><p>“Like what?” Kaveh asks, wary. </p><p>“Something more practical: a favor for a favor.”</p><p>Kaveh’s stomach twists, lips pressing together. Kaveh already owes Al-Haitham. He owes him more than can ever be repaid, not that Kaveh will ever stop trying. The thought of having his father hanging over them both as another debt, though, makes his heart sink. There’s only so much Kaveh can do to attempt to lessen the load even without factoring in mora. Cleaning house, cooking, laundry, doing the shopping…Al-Haitham always says Kaveh doesn't have to do those things, but what else is there he could do? Kaveh supposes he could just...be out of the house more. That should lighten Al-Haitham's mood.</p><p>“You want my professional expertise with these,” Al-Haitham says, tapping a finger to the edge of the box. “It seems fair that I ask you for yours.”</p><p>“Oh. Yes. You want me to redecorate and refurbish this place into an actual house. <em>Yes</em>. I’ve been telling you I’d do it for <em>ages</em>. Yes.”</p><p>Al-Haitham rolls his eyes.</p><p>“No. But yes.”</p><p>“What did you learn in school to become so marvelously succinct? I’m regretting this already.”</p><p>“There is a house I want you to look at,” Al-Haitham deigns to finally explain. “Just as these books are unreadable and indecipherable, this house is inaccessible. I want you to find out why and get it to open once more.”</p><p>Kaveh nods slowly. “I’d need to see the house. But sure. I’ll give it a shot. I agree to your terms.”</p><p>Without further preamble, Al-Haitham reaches into the box and pulls out a journal. The cover is worn, the edges softened with time until the corners are rounded and curved inwards. The edges of the pages have hints of water marks. Kaveh expects Al-Haitham to try and open it, but he just holds it in his hand, slowly turning it over, lightly skimming his fingers along the edges, the binding, the cracks in the spine without any force.</p><p>He sets that one aside and goes onto the several papers that were stitched together with fraying, browned thread. Even as Al-Haitham picks it up the ink starts to dribble, sliding off to pool on one side of the page. Al-Haitham’s brows raise up but he makes no comment, setting those aside too. Kaveh stands there, watching and waiting with hope and resignation strangling the two sides of his heart as Al-Haitham empties the box, creating neat stacks of different types of materials. He doesn’t try to open any of the books. He glances at the photographs and the front pages of the bound papers. He doesn’t even bother to make an attempt with the letters or notes. He just sorts it all into neat categories. All without saying a word.</p><p>“Well?” Kaveh asks when the box is empty.</p><p>Al-Haitham surveys the piles before picking up that first book he’d touched, running his thumb over the cracked and broken spine, eyes narrowing. He holds the book in his palm on its spine, letting it balance. Then with his other hand he runs his fingertip down the water-stained and warped pages. The book in Al-Haitham’s palm seems to tremor, before its pages press tighter together. Like a mouth refusing to spill its secrets.</p><p>“That’s all you have to show for yourself?” Al-Haitham says, sounding bored. “Is your son’s begging not enough?”</p><p>Before Kaveh can say anything to that, the book shudders and falls open in Al-Haitham’s hands. Right down the center. Kaveh’s eyes widen, but even as he turns to look the contents of the pages start to twist, the ink scattering like hares in a field as the shadow of the hawk crosses them.</p><p>“That’s what I thought,” Al-Haitham says, closing the book again and setting it down. He turns towards Kaveh. “This is not an external security feature or manner of magic cast by your father to protect the contents of his journals. It’s entirely internal, naturally developed over time after your father’s death by the books and documents themselves—innate to them and a matter of negotiation rather than brute-force technique.”</p><p>“Meaning?”</p><p>“I have to convince them to be read. Or rather, I have to convince them to let <em>you</em> read them.”</p><p>Kaveh stares at Al-Haitham. “It’s a book. They’re letters. Are you having me on? Al-Haitham, I might not have dedicated myself to the written word as you have. But you can’t think me this easy to fool. Be serious. You have to convince a book that it needs to be read. What other purpose of a book is there other than to be read? What is the entire point of written communication if not communication?”</p><p>And if anyone deserves to read these books, wouldn’t it be Kaveh? What sort of convincing does Kaveh have to do here?</p><p>“I am being entirely serious. You asked for my professional expertise and I’m giving it to you. Did none of the others you spoke to say this?”</p><p>Everyone else Kaveh spoke to just told him it was hopeless and to ask Al-Haitham. Kaveh does not say this though. No need to flatter Al-Haitham’s horrendous ego.</p><p>“This is entirely illogical.” But Al-Haitham is the last path forward Kaveh has left. “Fine. I suppose if anyone could convince a book to do anything it would be you. You could wear down mountains into valleys just by being yourself. So, about the house?”</p><p>-</p><p>The road to the house is overgrown. Al-Haitham leads them from the well maintained main road out of Sumeru city down through the little clusters of farm houses and family plots that scatter at the edges of the Divine Tree’s roots outside of the main city walls. And then further out, into the fields, the forests. Here and there Kaveh spots a house or wall in the distance, some large family plot of land; the sort that belong to the older families in Sumeru, or at least the wealthy ones. Sometimes both. But the last house Kaveh noticed them passing was almost twenty minutes ago and now Kaveh is starting to wonder where they’re going exactly and if this is some sort of joke. Al-Haitham has the worst habits when bored.</p><p>The path they’re on has overgrown, weeds and grass are tall, almost to the knee. Kaveh almost snaps at Al-Haitham to say something, explain anything, when Kaveh feels it.</p><p>The house.</p><p>One moment they’re walking on a path. And then the next Kaveh feels something looming, watching in the distance. Kaveh’s professional mind takes over, shoving aside complaint of silence and mystery as he starts walking faster.</p><p>He asks the age of the house, the size of the plot, what grows here, so on and so forth. Al-Haitham’s answers swing between immediate and slow coming. But all of his answers are brief, perfunctory, barely extant in the depth of detail Kaveh needs to start painting a picture of what he’s walking into. Kaveh starts walking ahead of him. He doesn’t need Al-Haitham to lead, he can feel the house as they get closer, like some great beast. As though it were a looming mountain over a thin valley.</p><p>And there it is is, emerging out of the trees and the grass. A boundary wall. Clay or brick, Kaveh can’t tell—it’s been overgrown with jasmine so thick that they’re reaching out like arms; rolling off like a wave caught mid collapse, bowing under their own weight. He can barely see the gate door through them.</p><p>It’s not so much a house as it is an estate. Kaveh can already tell the sort upon approach. The kind that gets passed down through ancient lines, Sumeru’s eldest families. Just standing at the wall Kaveh can feel the magic of generations upon generations built up here, just barely shy of oppressive as it spills over the wall with the jasmine. But from the brief glimpse Kaveh could just barely see over the wall, it must be a beautiful house.</p><p>He wonders if it’s seized property from one of Azar’s accomplices, or someone involved in one of the Matra’s or Mahamata’s cases.</p><p>“So what’s the issue?” Kaveh asks.</p><p>“No one can get in.” Al-Haitham says.</p><p>“The key?”</p><p>Al-Haitham pulls out a finely wrought silver key from his pocket. It glitters in the light, perfectly intact.</p><p>“It is not the key that has failed in purpose, but the door. The house has locked itself,” Al-Haitham says, dropping the metal into Kaveh’s palm.</p><p>Kaveh turns to press his hand to the gate. It resists, but when he pushes harder it swings open with a low groan that makes the hair on Kaveh’s arms and neck stand at attention.</p><p>“Mehrak,” Kaveh commands, “Check ahead.” The briefcase nods and slips into the narrow opening the gate deigned to create. Kaveh gives it another push and it seems to hiss, the leaves of the jasmine rustling at the disturbance before it gives way enough for Kaveh to look inside.</p><p>It’s miserable in there, from what Kaveh can see. Weeds and grass overgrown over tile and gravel and stone. A decorative pond choked with water plants. A gnarled tree with branches hanging low and what looks like a mess of rotted leaves and fruit all around its risen and tangled roots that have ripped up paving stone.</p><p>“What the hell happened to it?” Kaveh asks. It looks abandoned. But how can a house with such a clear and present life be so run down? Something isn’t adding up here. It must have been abandoned, locked itself up, within the past century for it to still be this present.</p><p>“Nothing,” Al-Haitham says flatly.</p><p>“Clearly,” Kaveh mutters as Mehrak chimes the all clear. She returns and displays a rough layout of the front courtyard for him. She could only see the front, the way around the sides was blocked by overgrowth. Kaveh absently gestures for Al-Haitham to follow him as he slips through the gate. But Al-Haitham stands where he is, making no attempt at moving.</p><p>“I cannot pass,” Al-Haitham says. Then, to illustrate his point, he presses his hand forward. Right at the threshold of the gate, Al-Haitham’s hand presses against an invisible barrier. His palm presses flat, fingers splayed wide, but he cannot push forward.</p><p>Peculiar.</p><p>Kaveh frowns, then turns forward. Before him, the house itself looks to be in remarkably good shape all things considered. </p><p>What must have once been a beautiful garden is clearly overgrown, with obvious signs of neglect. Missing parts of the roof’s shingles and tiles, wear and dirt accumulated on the walls, bits of vine and moss on the walls and pillars seem to be the worst of the damage at a glance. He doesn’t see any holes in the roof or broken windows or any signs of disruption. At least the place hasn’t been desecrated or pilfered, or so it would seem from the outside. The place could be livable in short order, based on the exterior. Someone would need to hire a landscaper though, and maybe fill in that pond which must be some kind of pest breeding ground at this point. Everything here is stagnant looking. Depressing.</p><p>Even the flowers look morose. Gloomy. Everything is still and shadowy.</p><p>Kaveh looks around the front courtyard. The walls on this side are no better. Maybe all that’s left is woody and thick jasmine, having eaten away all the clay and brick and stone. The paving stones and gravel lining are uneven underneath Kaveh’s feet. They crunch softly, breaking up the silence as he slowly makes his way to the front door.</p><p>Kaveh walks forward, feeling Al-Haitham’s eyes on him as he climbs up the front steps. For some reason, it feels like all Kaveh can hear is his heartbeat, his own breathing. He doesn’t think he’s ever been so nervous previewing a project before. Is it because Al-Haitham keeps staring at him? That can’t be. But Kaveh’s hands are strangely clammy. He almost fumbles the key as he slides it into the lock. There’s resistance when he turns it, but it does turn.</p><p>The front door opens without so much as a whisper.</p><p>Kaveh turns to look over his shoulder. Far away, a colorful spot of jewel-blue and Sumeru-green and luxurious black, Al-Haitham gestures for him to go inside.</p><p>Kaveh turns to Mehrak who shakes herself from side to side. No indication of the house being occupied.</p><p>When he enters the house he’s surprised to find it so…well. Neat. Mehrak immediately starts going around to scan things, taking her own precise notes for Kaveh to review later. But as Kaveh walks into his house, ducking down and murmuring a soft apology for entering uninvited, he notes that it seems <em>fine</em>. </p><p>But there’s something wrong here. Kaveh, somehow, managed to enter when he assumes others failed. And all appears, at a first glance, well. But there’s something that sets his teeth on edge about this place. It feels like he’s being watched. Not unusual with an ancestral home with this much magic in it. But this watching is…unsettling. The house, for all of its open dimensions and grand size, seems so small upon entering. Squeezed. Compressed.</p><p>There’s dust, yes. But no spiders. No cobwebs. Kaveh doesn’t see any traces of pests like mice or roaches, the things one would expect to take over after a house has been abandoned. There’s some minor damage—the curtains have some holes in them, some of the wood is cracked, bits of paint and plaster are cracked and flaking too. But it isn’t as bad as he thought it would be. No. There’s something else wrong.</p><p>As Kaveh moves through the house, Mehrak returns. She displays her map and Kaveh takes another look around.</p><p>Here’s one thing wrong. The interior doesn’t match the exterior. It’s the size. There must be other hallways, other rooms, other places—but Kaveh doesn’t see a place to get to them. The house is actively hiding them. </p><p>Kaveh has walked through the front entryway and the long room it opens up into. This room connects to a kitchen, which in turn opens up to a back courtyard. Through the windows Kaveh can see the wings of extensions that were built onto the house later. As expected from an ancestral estate. There’s slight variations in design, but he wouldn’t be able to date any of it without a closer looks.</p><p>The doors and windows don’t open. And Kaveh can’t find any hallways or stairs that lead to the other places in the house. Al-Haitham had only the one key.</p><p>Other things start to note themselves down in Kaveh’s head as he walks around the two rooms—which are admittedly quite large rooms—he has access to. </p><p>The front room just through the entryway is…strangely familiar, although Kaveh can’t figure out why. Is it something in the motifs? The design? The layout? Kaveh places a hand on the back of a wooden divan. The wood is cold. Kaveh can feel dust underneath his palm, but when he tries to rub it off with a handkerchief it refuses to budge. Kaveh’s hand comes away dust free when he tries to rub his thumb into it, too. The furniture wants its abandonment, it would seem.</p><p>This doesn’t make sense either. Who were the last occupants? They didn’t bring any of their things with them? It doesn’t look like this house was even packed up. No dust cloths over furniture, no signs of someone packing anything away to take with them—every shelf is full, all of the cabinets seem to have their belongings. In the kitchen Kaveh saw dust and rust covered pots and pans hanging on the wall. He’d even seen ropes of long-dried-up vegetables, spices, and herbs hanging from the exposed beams of the ceiling. It was like whoever left just…got up and walked away and never came back.</p><p>Was this house really abandoned?</p><p>Kaveh attempts to read some of the books on the shelves or take a closer look at the paintings and photographs on the walls, but it’s too dark in the house. He can’t see any details. Another oddity, considering the house’s location. Even with some of the tall overgrown trees he had seen and the growths of vegetation—at this time of day, it shouldn’t be this dark.</p><p>He had checked all of the windows. All of the windows are clear. Not a scratch on them—both the stained glass and the regular clear ones. Kaveh pushes the drapes open further to try and get more light into the room, but it doesn’t help or do anything other than give Kaveh a sneezing fit.</p><p>There’s another thing. The house is too dark. There are several windows but the light doesn’t reach very far. In fact, it barely clears the window. Most of what Kaveh’s taken in has come from Mehrak’s light or the faint glow of Kaveh’s own Vision at his thigh. How is the light not reaching anything?</p><p>In addition to the strange lack of light, temperature in the house is also too cold. Even if the house has been shut up and in the dark for years, it shouldn’t be this cold. <em>It’s Sumeru</em>, it only gets this cold at night.</p><p>And the air in the house. It’s so <em>stale</em>. Still. Not even the dust that Kaveh disturbed from the curtains lingers in the air. It’s suffocating in here. Understandable for it being shut up for so long, but really—<em>why is the air so dead</em>—</p><p>No sooner has Kaveh thought this than the house, suddenly, seems to close in around him. All of the darkness rushes forward, abandoning any pretense of attempts at obeying the logic of physics and sensation. The light from the windows dims to near nothing, plunging Kaveh into the faint green glow of his Vision and Mehrak’s face. The frame of the house itself groans, creaks, growls, wood seeming to bow and twist like it’s trying to swallow. The sound, after so long in what he now recognizes as unnatural silence, is deafening. The air turns frigid in the lungs and Kaveh feels his earrings, his necklace, the metal ornaments on his clothing start to cool rapidly.</p><p>Kaveh hears the sound of doors and windows rattling in their frames, and from some distant corner of the house an echo of a groan shudders loose. A gust of moist, shivering air slides down Kaveh’s back that ends in a high pitched whine. Even as the whine tapers off the sobbing begins and Kaveh understands now—that’s what’s wrong—<em>this</em> is what was wrong—it was <em>wrong</em>—</p><p>Kaveh runs, the door handle underneath his palm is like ice. He feels it burn as he twists, pulling the door open, Mehrak at his side as he rushes out of the house. He turns over his shoulder, panting for breath as he enters the slightly warmer air that’s still too cold for his comfort. The door behind him clicks shut silently, anticlimactically. But the house, above, looms, not proud, not pleased. But something.</p><p>“Well?” Al-Haitham says as soon as Kaveh crosses the threshold of the gate to the other side. It’s like stepping into a whole different world. Kaveh didn’t realize it going in, but now that he’s come out of the house the difference is stark.</p><p>Kaveh hears the sound of wind, of birds on this side. The air is warm and full of life. The light is brighter. The grass even seems to literally be greener. Kaveh turns back towards the house to check. No. It<em> is</em> greener. When he walked through the threshold, it was like all of life suddenly stopped. No sounds. No movement. Nothingness.</p><p>Just death.</p><p>“Someone died in that house,” Kaveh says. “There’s—there’s grief in there.<em> Too much</em>.” He’s never been in a house like that one before—those houses are dangerous unto themselves and are usually just put up for complete demolition—but he’s read the case studies. Sometimes if a murder or something terrible happens in a house, it soaks into the wood, the glass, the iron. Just like how a place will normally soak up the good, the surprising, the pleasant, they can also soak in the awful, the heart-breaking. Usually the two balance out, with the good winning over at least a little. But when the unpleasant tips the scales it changes the places. Makes it…makes it something else. “What happened here? Who’s house is this?”</p><p>Al-Haitham nods as though he fully expected this. And he didn’t warn Kaveh about it? Bastard.</p><p>“Yes. Many people died in this house,” Al-Haitham confirms. “Some of them are even buried on the land.” And then, almost like an afterthought, he answers, “It is my house.”</p><p>Kaveh, in the middle of handing Al-Haitham the key, fumbles it in shock. Al-Haitham catches the key, motions sharp as he closes the metal into his palm and tucks it away. Al-Haitham’s expression gives nothing away. To all the world he looks completely unbothered, unaffected by the admission; as though it’s perfectly normal to come from a house so vividly haunted and absorbed in death throes.</p><p>“This is the ancestral home of my father and my grandmother who raised me,” Al-Haitham explains. “It is the ancestral house of a line that goes back almost as far as the Akademiya does. I expect many people died here, and were also born here on this land. The most recent of those deaths being my grandmother’s, and the last of those births being my own.” Al-Haitham’s eyes move from the house to Kaveh. “I have not set foot on this property in almost twenty years. I am not allowed to.”</p><p>“What? Why? Did the inheritance not pass to you?”</p><p>“It did. Uncontested. My surviving relatives have no interest in this house. And those who did came and were rejected as I was, and gave up. The house is legally in my possession, my name is on all of the documents pertaining to both the building itself and the surrounding lands. I have paid all taxes due without fail every year since it has come into my possession. I have had this key since I was a boy. But I cannot enter. I have not been able to enter this house since my grandmother died.”</p><p>Kaveh rears back. An ancestral house refusing the last of its blood? A direct last descendant who’d grown up in its care and inherited uncontested and through both will of owner and law? Unheard of. The only thing that would cause a house to reject someone who had such a strong tie to it would be if that person did something unspeakable. If the house no longer wanted them, could no longer stand them—</p><p>And sure, <em>Kaveh</em> can’t stand Al-Haitham most of the time. But he can’t imagine the <em>literal</em> <em>house</em> the man grew up in throwing him out. Kaveh can’t imagine Al-Haitham ever doing something so egregious that the very house that was built and nourished by the blood and bone of his ancestors would turn him away.</p><p>“What the hell did you do to it?” Kaveh whispers.</p><p>“I told you,” Al-Haitham replies. “Nothing.” His mouth curves up. The smile, however, is not pleasant to see. It is a cold smile. Colder than the house Kaveh just ran out of. “Is it not a fitting favor, Kaveh? Your father's books deny you, and my ancestral home denies me. As you said: entirely illogical. And yet here we are. This is what I want you to find out. What did I do to cause it to exile me and what can be done to get me back inside?”</p>

<p>Kaveh goes to the house for a few hours every few days. Al-Haitham goes with him the first few times, to make sure he knows the way. At the threshold of jasmine and death, he places the silver key into Kaveh’s palm and waits. The both of them wait for the house to kick Kaveh out again, but it does not. By the fourth time they go around, the gates fully open with only the slightest bit of resistance. Through the front windows Kaveh can see Al-Haitham standing, waiting. Sometimes Al-Haitham waits the entire time—however many minutes or hours Kaveh is in there before he’s perfunctorily evicted as he was that first day. Sometimes Al-Haitham walks away somewhere between Kaveh’s glances out the window or doorway.</p><p>When Al-Haitham stays, Kaveh passes him the key and reports his small, minute findings which are incredibly unimpressive and not much in the way of findings at all. Al-Haitham never asks any questions and gives no indication of any disappointment. He just nods along as they walk back to the city.</p><p>Eventually Al-Haitham stops going with Kaveh. Kaveh just says, “I’m going to the house,” and Al-Haitham nods and hands Kaveh the key. Or if Al-Haitham is on his way out, Al-Haitham will leave the key in the front room, on the table near the window with the slate they use to pass notes to each other so they don’t have to speak face to face.</p><p>The house doesn’t want Kaveh there. This much is clear from the way it gets fed up with him and chases him off. But it isn’t blocking him out entirely. The house, as befitting a house that spat out someone like Al-Haitham, is <em>curious</em>. That’s the only conclusion Kaveh can come to based on his limited experiences with it.</p><p>Just as Kaveh is exploring the house, studying what he can of the spaces it’s permitted him to see (not many), the house is studying Kaveh back. It pushes his buttons, trying to suggest things, imply things—trying to see what makes him tic. Some days it does this in almost gentle ways, most times it does not. Sometimes the house lets him hang around for a few hours before running him out the front door, and other times it can only stand his presence for a few minutes before violently ejecting him. It’s confused about his presence there. That makes two of them.</p><p>Mehrak, at least, seems entirely comfortable. The house has mostly left her alone. Maybe it finds her charming. Or maybe, again, it’s like Al-Haitham and just has a strange affinity for certain creatures—Kaveh not being one of them.</p><p>Aside from the front room with its darkness and the kitchen with its stillness, Kaveh’s progress has mostly been outdoors. Kaveh’s explored the front courtyard and he’s managed to cut his way through the overgrown vegetation to get around to the sides of the house to explore the wings and expansions of the house.</p><p>As Kaveh thought, the expansions were added much later, over time, as the family no doubt grew. There’s slight variations in color and types of wood, small differences in style and method of construction. Kaveh still can’t date any of it. The house has hidden itself underneath layers of vines, moss, and thick shrubs and grasses. What parts of the house that are visible are far beyond Kaveh’s reach. Trees, tall and imposing, tower up against the edges of the house and some shrubs get so dense that Kaveh has no choice but to cut at them with his claymore. Through the trees Kaveh sees orchards overgrown. Through small hole he’d managed to make in a fence he saw the remnants of what must have once been a vegetable garden with raised planters. Mehrak, in her own explorations, found a chicken coop—long emptied. There was also a detached stable and carriage house, also emptied. Although the carriage remained just as neglected as the rest of the house—torn between a state of abandonment and precise care that defies time.</p><p>Kaveh found more ponds, all overgrown as well. Choked up by aquatic flora. He also found some fountains gone dry. The house’s grounds are expansive, sprawling—labyrinthine with how the vegetation has grown wild to swallow up any of the paths made by Al-Haitham’s predecessors over the centuries. It leads off into orchards, into farmland gone wild. And it also leads into what Kaveh suspects to be the family plot. Not that he or Mehrak saw that. The land firmly denied them both any access, turning them right around whenever they got close to it. Kaveh’s accidentally walked entirely off of the land without realizing it when that happens. </p><p>One moment Kaveh will be walking through air so still that his own breath would be disrupting the silence like thunder, and Mehrak’s chimes—even softened—were like explosions, and then suddenly he’d be over the invisible boundary line and the world would flood with sounds and colors and sensations that would have him reeling and stumbling right back into the deadened air.</p><p>Of the progress Kaveh has made of the actual house—well. He’s not sure if there’s <em>any</em> progress to report. Kaveh’s caught traces of the house being…well. A house. Sometimes Kaveh hears, or sees, echoes of the family that once walked its halls and tended its gardens. In the limited space he is allowed, Kaveh has sometimes seen in glimpses from the windows silhouettes, strange shapes. Once Kaveh swears that he saw a face watching him through the kitchen window as he tried to open cabinets. It was not a human face. Not really.</p><p>It was pale, head-shaped. But the eyes and the mouth and the nose were smudges of shadow, hollow. A skull covered in pale clay. It watched him all the way to the front room as the cold air got colder and colder. He couldn’t see it as he walked through the front courtyard. But he felt it watching him through the house all the way until he crossed through the threshold of the jasmine gate.</p><p>There are other echoes. Sometimes Kaveh will hear the patter of feet, plaster and dust drifting down from above to startle him as it lands on his nose, his hair. But by the time his head turned up to look it would be over. Or sometimes Kaveh would hear, faintly, as though he were imagining it, someone singing. Or crying. It’s hard to tell the difference in a house like this.</p><p>Once, Kaveh thinks he caught the house by surprise. He had been coming back from a separate commission. He’d told Al-Haitham he’d check on the house in the afternoon. He didn’t make it until almost evening. It was, he admits, a bad idea to go to the clearly upset and resentful house in the evening hours but Kaveh is a scholar at heart and when presented with a mystery—even if it was one that was so clearly dangerous—he couldn’t leave it alone.</p><p>Kaveh entered the house and just as he opened the door he heard the sound of laughter. A child’s laughter. Kaveh cracked the door open just enough to peer through. The house was, inexplicably, lighter inside than it was outside, although there were no lights on. The dusk’s fading rays were caught by those clear glass windows up front and magnified into gold. A fragment of a memory, an echo of a time long gone, was playing in the front room. Kaveh couldn’t see much from the angle, but he heard the child’s feet—bare—as they thumped on the wooden floor. And then, before Kaveh could try to see more, all of the lights went pitch and the house seemed to scream at him, freezing air blowing into his face through that cracked open door so hard it made his eyes sting. Kaveh pulled back just fast enough to avoid getting his nose broken by the door. The key refused to turn after that.</p><p>But the house still let him in later. So isn’t that just strange? <em>Why</em> does it let him in?</p><p>Kaveh looks around the front room, trying to imagine the laughing child. Was it Al-Haitham? Kaveh has a hard time imagining Al-Haitham as a child. In Kaveh’s mind (illogical as it may be) Al-Haitham walked into the world with his proud head held high and his tongue as sharp as a sword fresh from the forge. Sure, Kaveh knew Al-Haitham when they were younger. But the only thing time ever did was make Al-Haitham sharper. Stranger. Not that Kaveh can talk, he supposes.</p><p>Now that Kaveh knows that this is Al-Haitham’s house, the house of his ancestors, he can understand <em>why</em> he felt it so familiar when he first walked into it. There’s a resemblance here, between this country estate and the much smaller house nestled in the roots of the Divine Tree. For all that the house in the city was not built to be a house, Al-Haitham made it one anyway.</p><p>And in the process, it looks like he was trying to recreate <em>this</em> house. Or parts of it. But Al-Haitham was doing it from memory. And the result is that it looks half-assed or like he gave up partway through when he realized he couldn’t do it. Whether it was from flaw of memory, lack of available resources, or simply because he simply couldn’t Kaveh doesn’t know.</p><p>Kaveh can see shadows of it, shared between the two houses though. Kaveh can’t speak to colors because it’s so dark, but certain styles he can see carried over. The arrangement of furniture, certainly—the pairing of certain objects and how they’re organized.</p><p>Today Kaveh has come to inspect the electrical wiring of the house. Al-Haitham had said that when his parents were alive—when electric lighting was becoming widespread—that certain parts of the house and been upgraded: the entryway, the kitchen, a few bedrooms and bathrooms, some offices. Kaveh has not seen any of these rooms aside from the first on the list and Al-Haitham couldn’t give him any clearer details. When Mehrak showed him the rough schematic she’d made Al-Haitham just shook his head.</p><p><em>What a load of rubbish,</em> Kaveh thinks as he uses his Vision to illuminate the entryway as brightly as he can, Mehrak aiming her own lights up at the ceiling. <em>Is now really the time to be vague about personal matters?</em> Kaveh thinks as he tries to find any source of light switch or sensor in the darkened entryway.<em> Of all the times to be vague and frustratingly evasive, what’s the point in that now?</em></p><p>After Kaveh fruitlessly walks around the entire entryway and front room for what feels like an entire hour, carefully running his hands over every bit of wall he can reach to find the light-switch or any kind of electrical socket but coming up empty with nothing but hands smeared with dust and grit, Kaveh stands up, glaring in the direction of the front gate.</p><p>“Al-Haitham, you tight-lipped bastard—“ is as far as Kaveh gets before Mehrak collides into him, sending him sprawling. There’s a loud, teeth-rattling crash that happens at the same time.</p><p>The house dropped the glass ceiling light right where Kaveh had been standing.</p><p>Alarm floods Kaveh’s body as the house rouses to full fury, just as it did that first day but this time a hundred times worse. The air turns to ice in Kaveh’s lungs, cold enough that it stings his eyes. From all around the sounds of screaming start to kick up, and the entire house is plunged into absolute darkness.</p><p>Kaveh throws himself to this feet, Mehrak concentrating her light as densely as she can but barely illuminating anything at all. Kaveh makes his way to the front door by memory alone. At his back he feels hands pulling at his hair, his clothes, a hand closes around his Vision and Kaveh releases the built up energy inside in a blinding flash that for only the briefest of moments lights up the entryway. Ahead of him, the door. Foolishly, Kaveh had turned to look behind and in that brief moment of light as his hand closed around the door handle, Kaveh sees that same haunting face. That smudge of a face with its malformed sockets as it screams at him with the voices of a dozen, a hundred echoes of lives lived and lost within these very walls—</p><p><em>OUT</em>.</p><p>Kaveh throws the door open, not needing to be told twice, fully intent on going back to Al-Haitham and calling the entire thing off. There’ll be no prying any secrets out of this house. Best to just burn it all and start over again or sell the land to someone who could possibly overwrite whatever dark stories that caused this place to pervert against its nature as a house.</p><p>As a parting blow, as Kaveh is running towards the jasmine threshold, which has already opened for him to leap through, Kaveh hears something sailing through the air aimed directly at himself. Mehrak chimes in alarm, catching it for him as they clear the threshold, the heavy wooden gates slamming shut behind him and almost catching on the fluttering ends of his scarf and shirttails.</p><p>When Kaveh turns to look, Mehrak is levitating a pitaya, its green barbs wicked and mean looking even on this side of the threshold. Kaveh tentatively reaches out to touch it, and feels a razor sharp line of pain on his palm just from trying to hold it. </p><p>“You carry that,” Kaveh tells Mehrak, wary as he draws his hand back. The cut is shallow, at least. Mehrak looks between him and the house. “No, Mehrak. I don’t think we’ll be going back.”</p><p>At least, not today. Kaveh needs more information here. He needs to know the details of Al-Haitham’s exile. The house is throwing fruit at Kaveh to drive him off—fruit Al-Haitham is devastatingly allergic to. That’s a message. <em>Why</em> would the house be cultivating something so dangerous to Al-Haitham? <em>What</em> did he do to it?</p><p>When Kaveh returns to the house in Sumeru City, Al-Haitham is already home.</p><p>“Al-Haitham,” Kaveh yells out into the house, looking around the front room and trying to shake the unease of the similarity he’s picked up on between it and the ancestral house, “Al-Haitham. We need to talk about this house of yours. What the hell did you do to it? Don’t give me that bullshit answer of <em>nothing</em>. I’m serious. I need details here, I’m getting nowhere and it almost <em>killed</em> me today.”</p><p>Kaveh finds Al-Haitham in his study. Before Kaveh can yell at him for not answering, he realizes Al-Haitham is working on the notes. Kaveh’s father’s notes—not one of the leather bound journals, but one of the sets of papers that was sewn together. Kaveh falls silent, quietly padding into the room to watch.</p><p>There’s already one finished set of notes off to the side of Al-Haitham’s desk. Through some mixture of expertise and technology, Al-Haitham has restored the water-and-time-weathered pages so that they’re all straight and neat with new binding. There’s still obvious signs of age, which Kaveh finds himself oddly relieved to see. If the notes were perfect he supposes it might…take something away in an odd and indescribable way. It would change them. The words on the front still scramble away under Kaveh’s gaze. And when he reaches out to touch he can’t get the pages to turn. But the pages feel cleaner. Smoother. The paper itself seems brighter. The string binding it all together at the spine is soft under his fingers, but holds firm.</p><p>Al-Haitham has another set of papers in front of himself and several loops of glass arranged as magnifiers as he uses thin metal forceps and the smallest dendro shards Kaveh has ever seen to carefully pick the knots of string holding the notes together. Kaveh watches, silent and reluctantly fascinated as Al-Haitham uses the needle-thin forceps to pull a bit of browned and weathered string away from the pages, holding it with enough of a gap that he can ease the thin dendro shard underneath and start cutting.</p><p>Kaveh’s learned by now not to ask the obvious, so he asks, “Why are you doing that? Does it help?”</p><p>Al-Haitham doesn’t answer. But Kaveh, strangely enough, doesn’t mind. He understands the need to concentrate in silence, delaying all answer until he reaches a good part in his work for stopping. Kaveh can understand concentration and the ways it narrows down the entire world and makes everything else seem irrelevant and non-pressing.</p><p>As Al-Haitham carefully eases the thread out from the holes of the pages, carefully picking out stray fibers that got stuck as they unraveled from age, he answers sounding distracted, “Yes. It matters what a book looks like. You of all people shouldn’t need to be told about the importance of presentation. The books are self-conscious on top of everything else. Also, these ones were literally falling apart at the seams. I thought it might help both the reading and the reader if neither were afraid of a single page turning causing the entire enterprise to fall apart.”</p><p>“I’ll be honest with you, I only understood that last part.”</p><p>“I know. What were you yelling about when you came in earlier? We’ve not seen each other all day, so I find it hard to believe that I’ve somehow offended you.”</p><p>Kaveh shakes his head, mind turning back to the events of earlier today. “Look. I need to know more about the house. More details of it. I can’t make progress half-blind. It’s too dangerous.”</p><p>“What else is there to know?”</p><p><em>Everything</em>, practically. Kaveh runs a hand through his hair, leaning his hip against the heavy wooden desk as Al-Haitham continues removing the stitching of sheaf of notepaper’s binding.</p><p>“Well. What did you tell the other masters who you had try their hand at the house?”</p><p>“Nothing. There weren’t any others,” Al-Haitham says in that same distracted tone. It almost distracts Kaveh from how they’re talking about the man’s ancestral home. They could be talking about anything: the latest batch of Akademiya graduates, the newest release of Genius Invokation booster packs, that one cat that wanders the neighborhood screaming like its trying to start the end of the world.</p><p>“You mean to tell me that<em> I’m</em> the only one who’s ever been brought in to look at that house?” That thing is a giant safety hazard. Even if Al-Haitham wasn’t willing, at one point the Corps of Thirty and the Akademiya would have invited themselves to investigate.</p><p>“No. You’re not. Several other Master Architects and historians have been consulted on the house,” Al-Haitham confirms. “But you’re the only one who ever got past the gate.”</p><p>Kaveh narrows his eyes, crossing his arms over his chest as he stares at Al-Haitham’s down-turned face. “You expect me to believe that you brought some unknown number of persons to your ancestral home to examine it and not a single one of them ever asked you a single question about the place beforehand?” It’s basic protocol. And even if it wasn’t—isn’t that just common sense? To find out about whatever situation you’re getting into before leaping in? </p><p>“You’re the first one to ever ask me <em>anything</em> about it,” Al-Haitham says with a small shrug as he sets aside another bit of string. “I suspect that none of the others thought I <em>could</em> tell them anything.” Al-Haitham pauses, his tools going still as he raises his eyes, looking a little dazed as he squints at the wall. Kaveh wonders how long Al-Haitham’s been working. Al-Haitham puts the tools down entirely, pushing back from the desk as he presses the heels of his palms to his eyes with a tired sigh. “They weren’t wrong. All of the records on the house’s construction and modifications, its history, are locked inside—obviously where I don’t have access to them. And at the time, learning the history of the house wasn’t high on my list of priorities. I didn’t realize I would need to have it all memorized so soon. I had more important priorities to take care of.”</p><p>“Such as?”</p><p>Al-Haitham’s mouth, briefly, ticks up at a corner before leveling flat as he answers, “Learning how to make food my grandmother wouldn’t throw up. In any case, all I know about that house is from existing public records. Or at least, what remain of them now that the Akasha has been deactivated. I am not withholding any information from you, Kaveh. If there truly was anything useful that might help you, I would have told you of it.”</p><p>Al-Haitham’s hands drop him from his face, head tipped back against the back of the chair, head lolling towards Kaveh before pausing. Al-Haitham’s eyebrows raise up. “Ah. That’s from the house, is it? It remembered.”</p><p>Kaveh turns and sees Mehrak hovering next to him with the pitaya still in her grasp.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Al-Haitham leans forward, pulling off his work gloves before holding his bare hand out towards Mehrak who happily goes to deposit the fruit into his waiting palm. </p><p>“Ah, wait, be careful it’s—“ is as far as Kaveh gets before Al-Haitham accepts the fruit into this hand. To Kaveh’s confusion, Al-Haitham turns the fruit over between his palms. His <em>unharmed</em> palms. Kaveh’s own singular scratch stings something viciously as he watches Al-Haitham’s expression does something…almost soft.</p><p>“What?” Kaveh repeats, something in his mind slowly assembling itself into the shape of a hypothesis. “<em>What did the house remember</em>?”</p><p>“Pitaya are my favorite,” Al-Haitham answers. The spines and thorns of the fruit, in Al-Haitham’s palms, are soft as down as he gently thumbs on the green triangles.</p><p>“You’re allergic,” Kaveh points out rather needlessly. Kaveh’s seen Al-Haitham picking them out of his food and avoiding them. He’s never accepted one when offered. On the one occasion Kaveh did see Al-Haitham eat pitaya it had been on accident. It had been blended in with other fruits into a summer drink and Al-Haitham spent the rest of the day throwing up in the care of the Bimarstan.</p><p>Al-Haitham’s face continues to do that strange thing where it is almost tender, almost soft, almost like that of any other normal person’s. “Not to these ones. I never once felt sick eating a pitaya from the family plot. I didn’t find out I was allergic to them until afterwards.”</p><p><em>That</em> does not sound like a house that’s rejected its owner, its last living blood. That does not sound like a house haunted by death and grief. That sounds like every other ancestral house Kaveh has ever studied or heard of. A house that <em>dearly</em> <em>loves</em> its occupant. Things are not adding up.</p><p>“Al-Haitham. You said the house evicted you after your grandmother’s death. It was <em>immediately</em> after? Can you tell me the details of it?”</p><p>Al-Haitham nods absently, then stands. Al-Haitham gestures for Kaveh to follow after him, walking past Kaveh while contemplating the fruit in his hands. Kaveh follows after, trailing after Al-Haitham into the kitchen as Al-Haitham begins to speak.</p><p>“By the end of things, it was just myself and my grandmother in that house. And then it was just me. Three months after my grandmother’s funeral I left the house for some fresh air. I took some books from the study, some mora, and went to the city to read in one of the gardens, get some food, and clear my head,” Al-Haitham says. “I had already long taken over my grandmother’s duties around the house. The cleaning, the paying of bills, the cooking, so on and so forth. But that day I suppose I was rather restless and in need of a change of pace. Hm. I wonder.” Al-Haitham tips his head to the side, pausing in the middle of getting a knife to cut the fruit. Al-Haitham seems to weigh the pitaya in his hand before cupping it between both hands.</p><p>Kaveh watches as Al-Haitham simply…opens his palms and the fruit falls apart between them in two perfect halves. The flesh of the fruit glitters.</p><p>Al-Haitham sets both halves down and goes to get a spoon.</p><p>“When I returned in the afternoon the key would no longer turn. I couldn’t get back in. None of the windows would open, nor the doors. I couldn’t get any of the side gates open. I tried to climb some of the garden fences but no matter how long I climbed I never reached the top, or I would fall and be unable to get purchase to climb up again. I ended up going to the nearest neighbor’s house and stayed there while things got sorted out. None of the people my relatives contacted on my behalf could get past the gate, nor could I. And none of my extended family members could even make it to the gate at all. I signed up for the Akademiya so I could live in the dorms and that was it. There’s nothing else to tell.”</p><p>Al-Haitham turns towards Kaveh and holds out one of the halves along with a spoon. </p><p>“Are you sure?” Kaveh asks, partially meaning the fruit and partially meaning Al-Haitham’s sharing of all of this. Al-Haitham just continues to hold the half out to him.</p><p>“You brought it to me,” Al-Haitham says simply. “Besides, don’t I get to decide what to do with it since it was given to me?”</p><p>“Al-Haitham,” Kaveh turns the spoon over in his hand, hypothesis and theory solidifying into a conclusion in his head, “how old were you, exactly, when this happened?”</p><p>Al-Haitham squints at the wall across from them, like he’s not sure.</p><p>“Fifteen,” he answers slowly, and then shakes his head. “No. Fourteen. I turned fifteen when I joined the Akademiya. But she died when I was fourteen.”</p><p>Kaveh nods like he understands, like this is a completely expected answer and nothing at all to mourn over. Like it doesn’t feel like someone just took a hammer and swung it as hard as they could against Kaveh’s ribs. Kaveh takes a spoonful of fruit into his mouth to stop himself from saying something. Anything. </p><p>They eat standing, leaning against the kitchen counters not quite side by side but not separate either. Al-Haitham says nothing more: about the house, about the fruit, about the death, about anything. Kaveh doesn’t ask.</p><p>The fruit is possibly the best one he’s ever had of its kind in his entire life. It tastes like summer laughter in the mouth. It tastes like memory. It tastes like love.</p><p>But most importantly for Kaveh—it tastes like an <em>answer</em>.</p><p>-</p><p>When Kaveh asked for the key back again, Al-Haitham momentarily looked surprised. But he handed the key over without comment.</p><p>Kaveh now, with the safety of early morning at his back and the determination to get the theory he’s come to prove, stands before the jasmine threshold once more. The gate resists as it did that first time, groaning and hissing as he puts his back and full weight into shoving the wood open just enough for him to squeeze through. A sense of deep and powerful distaste and disapproval seems to rise out of the very ground itself as Kaveh focuses on putting one foot in front of the other until he’s at the door.</p><p>“I have the key,” Kaveh says, sliding it into the lock. Then, to test his hypothesis, Kaveh clarifies: “<em>Al-Haitham gave me the key.</em>”</p><p>The lock, reluctantly, clicks open. It feels like the key might snap as he turns it. But it turns. The door opens.</p><p>Kaveh pushes the door open as wide as it will go, trying to get as much light in as possible. He has Mehrak wait there, holding the door open as Kaveh looks upon the shattered ceiling lamp—the spray of glass and metal and wiring on the floor. Kaveh walks into the house, edging around that mess and feeling the crunch of glass underneath his shoes. </p><p>The ground is ice cold, frigid. Kaveh sets his jaw, feeling his teeth immediately begin to chatter. His nose and fingers sting. Above him the ceiling beams creak ominously, like pacing. Prowling.</p><p>He pushes open the drapes as far as they will go, working on getting in as much light as possible as he turns to take a look upon the front room once more with his new understanding of the situation.</p><p>Kaveh had already noted that this house and the one in the city were similar. But with Al-Haitham’s context of the situation, Kaveh can now understand not just the why of how they’re similar, but why the house in the city seems so…wrong. No. Not wrong. <em>Incomplete</em>. Half-hearted? Undone.</p><p>The house in the city was arranged like a distorted low-quality half-replica of this one, based entirely on what Al-Haitham was able to remember in whatever vague details he could grasp. <em>That’s</em> why it’s so mismatched, <em>that’s</em> why it looks so random at times. Al-Haitham’s house, from the moment Kaveh walked into it, had always felt strange to him.</p><p>It was like some strange mixture of a default template of a house in Sumeru and weird placements of personal items that did and did not seem like they belonged anywhere. But here is why they didn’t make sense.</p><p>They didn’t have the <em>context</em>. The things Al-Haitham had gathered in that house lacked the context to be stitched together, not like this house here does. All of the little trinkets, the arrangement of furniture, whatever patterns of texture and color that might be revealed with greater light—all of it comes from someone putting it there. And generations following coming around to build off of it. Over time, what might be seen as disparate pieces from different times and places came together to form a whole; united by the theme of hands and time and care that wear them down into something bound together. Items, no matter how strange and different from each other, become linked by their history. It’s a strange transitive property of the mind. Once you know the history of an object, it automatically links and becomes thematically connected to others. </p><p>But Al-Haitham was starting from scratch off of what he remembered. The items in that newer house don’t have the established network of themes, history, stories. Not <em>yet</em>. He was just starting—bringing together what he remembered with what he now has; combining who he remembered being with who he is now and seeing what that outcome looked like.</p><p>And this is not exactly a flaw. And it isn’t that it’s…wrong. No. Wrong isn’t the right word.</p><p>Rather—it was all <em>incomplete</em>. No. It’s in progress. And you can’t judge an in-progress work as though it were complete. What an amateur mistake on Kaveh’s part. If this were any of his juniors or mentees he’d have torn them to pieces for such a rank mistake.</p><p>Now as Kaveh squints into the barely discernible shapes in the dark, he can see the overlap between the two, where Al-Haitham had accurately remembered the broad strokes and gestures, then filled in the rest with whatever he felt might have fit. And to Kaveh, who did not have the background of knowing there was a larger picture to be filled, it had looked strange.</p><p>But that’s because he didn’t see the history. He forgot the most important thing about design—the age. The age of both the building itself, the time it was built in, and the occupant themself.</p><p>Al-Haitham was trying to recreate a memory he couldn’t have possibly been certain on—not if he was operating on memories from when he was a boy going through what was probably one of the worst times of his life. Didn’t Al-Haitham say it himself? He wasn’t quite focused on the details of the house. He was focused on trying to ease his grandmother’s passing as much as she could. Even Kaveh can’t remember what his own childhood home looked like in perfect detail. And Kaveh left that home under his own volition, with the option to carry with him whatever he pleased. Kaveh can remember the broad strokes of it, and a few smaller details. But he can’t place every single object and detail. In Kaveh’s memory of his childhood home there are gaps where he can only guess at what might have gone there and why.</p><p>Al-Haitham, consciously or unconsciously, was trying to recreate the comfort of a house full of history, already worn-in and made comfortable by generations, in a building that was entirely new and without. A building that was not ever meant to house anyone or anything, a place originally meant for pure research and scientific endeavor that Al-Haitham, through sheer brute force of will and signature tenacity, made into a house. That Al-Haitham made what he did out of such a place is already commendable; that he brought it so close to the ancestral home that Kaveh stands in today based on memories from several decades ago, no doubt colored and overridden by more emotional lenses, is even more impressive.</p><p>And he did it all by himself. </p><p>That’s the thing, isn’t it? Al-Haitham did it by himself. His own little experiment in trial and error; growth and change; adaptation and recall.</p><p>Kaveh closes his eyes and tries to remember it. Al-Haitham, before. When they first met. When they first came together. Kaveh remembers, now, Al-Haitham’s dorm room. He remembers when he first saw it—Kaveh’s first impression was that it was a barren place. Empty. At the time Kaveh thought that was just indicative of Al-Haitham as a person. Austere, minimalist, empty, entirely pragmatic.</p><p>But now, with this new context before him, all around him, Kaveh can draw a new, sorrowful conclusion.</p><p><em>That was all Al-Haitham had.</em> Al-Haitham said it himself. The day he was locked out of the house he only had a little bit of mora, a few books from the study, and the clothes on his back. No wonder Al-Haitham’s dorm consisted of only Akademiya textbooks, study implements, uniforms, and the bare standard furniture items and bedding.</p><p>Kaveh’s guilt, suddenly but not unexpected, rises and pangs against his ribs. Rotten and bruised. Like a plum.</p><p>And now Kaveh wonders—Al-Haitham had said he knew very little about this house. How much does Al-Haitham know about, well, <em>any of it?</em> The house? The land? The people who tended it, the people whom he descended from, who came together over generations to bring him into this world? What does Al-Haitham know of any of it? Where he comes from, who he comes from? What history comes with the name? What else did Al-Haitham lose out on because there was no one around to teach him of it?</p><p>Kaveh had known that Al-Haitham was an orphan, and that they were similar in this regard—touched by death and early loss. But they had never <em>spoken</em> about it. Al-Haitham never really brought it up and Kaveh didn’t dare bring it up himself. After all, to open the door to that conversation would be to expose himself to it as well. </p><p>Now Kaveh allows himself to think about it. He had, then and up until just a few hours ago, assumed that Al-Haitham was like Kaveh. Lonely, but not alone as a child. Kaveh had pieces of his childhood, his parents, with him always. And his mother was still present with him. He could write to her at anytime he wanted, needed to. It was not as though with her moving that she disappeared from his life. Kaveh’s pathways back to his roots always existed, even if he didn’t necessarily look at them directly or utilize them. His mother has always been a silent supporter at his back, ready to help him if he would just call out to her.</p><p>The love Kaveh and his mother have for each other is a complicated thing, but it continues to live and breathe and grow and wait.</p><p>Al-Haitham had no one. He had nothing. All he had was himself. All of the things that might have helped him were here, in this house that had turned him away.</p><p>The house that seems to be pressing down on Kaveh with its disapproval, its distaste—held back only by the fact that Al-Haitham put this key in Kaveh’s hand himself. But <em>oh</em>, it’s <em>waiting</em> for an excuse, isn’t it? An excuse to get rid of him.</p><p>Kaveh turns and glances to where Mehrak is. Even from here he can see the faint traces of steam rising from her as the temperature in the house slowly ticks lower and lower. Kaveh can feel the metal ornaments on his clothes, his jewelry, his very Vision itself, turning painfully icy. Kaveh’s lips hurt, his <em>breath</em> hurts. Hell, his <em>teeth</em> hurt from the cold. Kaveh turns and walks out of the light, limbs and joints aching from how deep the cold goes as he moves to stand over the shattered glass and dented metal.</p><p>With every step it feels like his feet freeze to the ground, or get stuck on something. He can hear the sounds of the soles of his shoes cracking, peeling away from the floor as he moves through what should be a rather small space but stretches out to prolong the intimidation. At times it feels like he’s stepping over ice. At times it feels like he’s stepping over…something liquid. Slick. Viscous. He feels it soaking into his shoes. Kaveh doesn’t dare look down, though.</p><p>The house looms at his back. A solid presence that Kaveh feels standing there. Waiting. The cold breath of the house puffs against the back of his head, stirring his hair. The muscles in Kaveh’s back ache like something is digging into them.</p><p>Kaveh breathes in deep, feeling the cold scrape all the way down to the bone like needles.</p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p>The house’s breathing pauses. The darkness waits, falling silent.</p><p>“I said what I said, then, out of frustration,” Kaveh says, fighting to keep his voice calm and level and also comprehensible. His teeth want to chatter. His tongue and lips feel numb from cold. “Al-Haitham is a complicated man and he doesn’t make life easy for those around him. It’s an excuse, yes. It doesn’t excuse anything though. You know this though, don’t you? You know this about him, you knew this about him before <em>anyone else in the world</em> did.”</p><p>As Kaveh speaks, the presence at his back remains, but the cold seems to ease its grip on his nerves, his bones. It becomes slightly easier to speak. Less painful.</p><p>“I’m here for <em>him</em>. He asked me to be here,” Kaveh says carefully, voice soft. “I’m doing this for him. And we—you and I—need to find a way to understand each other. He wants to talk to you.<em> I</em> want to talk to you.”</p><p>The cold has gone down to a chill. Kaveh’s limbs tingle as his body starts to warm again. The lights from the windows and open door seem to stretch just a little bit further into the house. The presence at Kaveh’s back takes a decisive step backwards.</p><p>Kaveh swallows, continuing, “He loved the pitaya.”</p><p>The light stretches a little further. The presence takes another step backwards. And another. And another. And another until it is just at the edge of Kaveh’s perception. Not gone. But not breathing down his neck, either. Waiting.</p><p>“Is there anything else…?” Kaveh trails off, not knowing how to complete the question.</p><p>Thankfully the house seems to have its own ideas. Loud, but somehow gently, Kaveh hears the click of a door opening. </p><p>Kaveh slowly turns. The lights from the open doors and windows now stretch into the front room entirely. Thinly, barely bringing any color in, but Kaveh can see.</p><p>Near the entrance to the kitchen, an opening into a hallway has appeared. Kaveh slowly walks towards it. Under his feet the floor slowly begins to warm until it’s just barely noticeable as cool, like walking on marble instead of ice. The hallway is dark, the outline of it just barely visible from the light of Kaveh’s Vision as he walks down it. He reaches out, keeping his hand lightly tracing over the walls and doorframes as he walks into the dark. The house remains silent around him as it watches his progress.</p><p>Kaveh doesn’t know how long he walks. The hallway must take some turns at some point, but he doesn’t notice them. It feels like he’s walking down a straight corridor. But suddenly, as though he did turn a corner, a square of light appears. A window. Across from that single window is a door. The one that must have clicked open.</p><p>Kaveh looks out the window and sees that he’s somehow several stories above ground, at least three. The tops of trees peer up at him in an endless stretch, along with the tiles of parts of the house below.</p><p>The door opens silently with barely a push. Inside, for just a brief moment, Kaveh sees an echo. A shadowy figure is standing, swaying in the middle of the room, holding a bundle, turning and swaying in a little circle before the figure seems to look up at Kaveh and evaporate.</p><p>The room appears to be some sort of nursery. There’s a cradle. A rocking chair. A table for changing the baby. Kaveh tips his head up and sees beautiful patterns of stars and flowers painted onto the ceiling. As Kaveh walks into the room, the place seems to brighten just a little. Kaveh smells that strangely unique smell that all newborn babies seem to have—all powdery and sweet. Just at the edge of his hearing he hears the sounds of lullabies in different voices, all overlapping each other but carrying the same notes of devotion.</p><p>As Kaveh looks over the room, careful not to touch anything without further invitation, a single drawer from a stout stack of them against the wall slides open. When Kaveh looks over the only thing inside is a single quilted blanket, the colors of it worn away and the patches and pieces of it sewn together repeatedly. When Kaveh carefully takes the blanket out the drawer shuts itself so sharply it almost catches the blanket again, like the house was already regretting the decision. But Kaveh snatches the blanket out in time.</p><p>The house opens the door of the nursery wider, encouraging Kaveh to leave. The walk out of the house is much faster than the walk in. In fact, Kaveh steps outside of the nursery, turns down one side of the hallway and sees nothing but darkness, then turns the other way and sees the broken ceiling lamp that he still has to clean up. Next time, apparently. The house is done with him for today.</p><p>Kaveh leaves with the blanket under one arm. The door to the house closes and locks itself behind him some degree of mildness compared to the last time he was rushed out. Once past the threshold of jasmine, Kaveh holds the blanket up and out. It’s a baby’s blanket, or a child’s. Passed down over generations, probably. It’s soft under his fingers. Some parts of it are so old they’re almost colorless, but they’re soft as silk. Other parts are clearly newer, repairs done over old.</p><p>When Al-Haitham comes home from work Kaveh hands the blanket to him. Al-Haitham stares at it. Then shrugs, moving into the house to investigate what’s for dinner.  </p><p>“I don’t know what this is,” he says. “If you found it in the nursery I’m assuming it was used for a baby.”</p><p>“Astute,” Kaveh said dryly, eyes narrowed.</p><p>Al-Haitham glances at Kaveh’s face, eyes momentarily flicking upward like he’s the one who’s trying to play guessing games with a house just barely inclined to lean towards civility.</p><p>“<em>Generations</em> of my family were born and raised from infancy to adulthood in that house,” Al-Haitham says, slowly stripping his gloves off to wash his hands. “You can’t expect me to know <em>who’s</em> blanket that is. It could have been mine, a distant cousin’s, my father’s, my grandmother’s, how would I know? It’s not like I was using it at age fourteen. Or do you remember every single item you’ve ever used over your entire life? If so then your talents are truly being wasted.”</p><p>Al-Haitham had a point.</p><p>Kaveh went back the next day and the house’s door swung open, the lights within slightly brighter, as if eager to hear of the result. And then, upon noticing that Kaveh has returned with the blanket in hand, they dim once more.</p><p>“He doesn’t remember,” Kaveh tells the house, trying not to address the shattered glass on the floor. He needs to find time to clean that up before the house starts pushing him around. “He was a child. Children don’t always remember the same things as adults.”</p><p>There is, suddenly, a great resounding clap that has both Kaveh and Mehrak startling. Kaveh jumps and Mehrak flashes in alarm.</p><p>Light floods in from the direction of the hallway Kaveh passed through yesterday. The light is bright, harsh, demanding. Kaveh walks into it, wary, with the blanket in hand and Mehrak at his back. He is not walking long. The hallway floor is illuminated by a stream of light that somehow manages to avoid all of the walls. The light curves, turning abruptly around a corner. And around that corner, the light diffuses into an echo layered over the actual shape of the house.</p><p>The wooden floors, under this softer light, are a warm reddish brown that’s been worn down by countless feet over centuries. Ahead of him there is an echo.</p><p>Spread out on the floor in a patch of sunlight in front of a window is this blanket. It must be this blanket. Why else would the house be showing him this?</p><p>There is a strange shape that could probably be a young child laying out on the blanket. It must be Al-Haitham as a boy. But just like with the other echoes and strange figments of memory Kaveh has seen, the shape is blurry. No real details. Just vague shapes that come together to look similar to a body.</p><p>The echo of Al-Haitham as a boy, perhaps no older than five or six, is laying out on the blanket on his back. He holds something above himself. A book? That seems very in character. There’s a small stack of them, at the edge of the blanket. The boy holds the thin book over his head, small feet idly swaying, pointing in, pointing out. And then the boy lowers the book, sitting up and looking at the window.</p><p>Kaveh follows the echoes’ gaze as the window—in memory and in present—swings open. The boy sets the book aside, rising to his feet and walks up to the window, propping his chin up against the windowsill. And then he puts his hands on the windowsill and pulls himself up, clambering up and over, tipping off to the other side.</p><p>Kaveh, despite knowing this is a memory, rushes over to look anyway. He has no idea what floor they’re on.</p><p>Luckily for Al-Haitham, it seems that this memory is one that occurs on the first floor. Beyond the window Kaveh can see into a portion of the gardens. Fields. Pitaya plants stretch out a few meters from the house. Kaveh cannot see the echo, nor what those plants once looked like. In present the plants are overgrown, their wooden support structures broken and and rotted. It looks like a mangled and uneasy sea of geometric green waves with the occasional spot of angry pink.</p><p>Kaveh steps away from the window, turning back towards the blanket on the floor, startling when he sees the echo of Al-Haitham climb through him. The echoes’ arms are full of fruit. The echo deposits his bounty onto the blanket, picking one up in small hands. The fruit is almost too big for him to hold. It splits evenly in his hands.</p><p>And then the echo is gone. Kaveh turns back towards the window, towards the abandoned and wild fields.</p><p>“Did you know,” Kaveh says half to himself, half to the house, “that ever since Al-Haitham left here, he hasn’t eaten these once? He can’t. They make him sick. Yours are the only ones he’s ever been able to eat. They are his favorite.”</p><p>Even as he says it, something in Kaveh’s throat starts to squeeze with grief. Around him, the house mourns. In the distance, Kaveh hears the sound of someone start to cry. And from somewhere else, several other voices begin to sing—or rather, chant. A mourning song.</p><p>There are things that Kaveh lost and could never recover from his childhood. The taste of his father’s cooking was one of them. The recipes exist. But they miss the unique touches that his father added to make them his. Kaveh can make the same dishes. So can Kaveh’s mother. Kaveh sometimes makes his father’s fatteh now. But it’s not the same. Never the same. That’s half of why he rarely makes it. But he could if he wanted. Kaveh could walk into most restaurants and order the same foods. They’ll never taste the same but they’re there.</p><p>Al-Haitham didn’t even have that. Kaveh imagines it—Al-Haitham, just a boy, freshly alone and evicted from his own house. How did Al-Haitham find out he was allergic if he’d spent his entire life eating those fruits plucked straight from the tree? Al-Haitham must have bought one, gone out and searched one out. And when he ate it…</p><p>Kaveh swallows hard, turning towards the crying house. This is a house that loved, loves. <em>How</em> did it become like this? Kaveh doesn’t understand it.</p><p>“Is there anything else you can give him?” Kaveh asks. “Something…<em>something he’d know.</em> Something that would help him understand?”</p><p>From deeper in the house, Kaveh hears the sound of something heavy fall. The stream of light slowly slithers further down the hallway. Kaveh follows it until a door quietly swings open to reveal some sort of sitting room, or maybe a study. Or maybe it’s a storage room? There’s shelves of boxes and books, but there’s also a tiny wooden chair crammed into the corner next to a shuttered window. A book is on the floor, pushed out from one of the shelves. Kaveh picks it up. The book is so old and faded Kaveh can’t read the cover. But he takes it anyway.</p><p>This time, when he hands the item to Al-Haitham, Al-Haitham’s eyes brighten with a faint mote of recognition.</p><p>“This was my grandfather’s,” Al-Haitham says. He’d been in the middle of redoing the binding on one of Kaveh’s father’s sets of notes. Even as Kaveh turns to look, the letters hurry to cram themselves into collisions at the corners of the pages. Al-Haitham weights the book in his hands before flipping it open. The entire front inside cover is, from top to bottom, filled with ink scribbles. Al-Haitham’s nose wrinkles, but he looks like he’s going to laugh. “Ah. I see his reputation was not unfounded.”</p><p>Kaveh gestures for Al-Haitham to expound. Al-Haitham shakes his head, but he’s flipping through the book now. Kaveh ignores the spark of envy as the pages practically fly underneath Al-Haitham’s fingers while Kaveh’s father’s writing does its best to evaporate out of the corner of his eye.</p><p>“My grandmother and the few relatives I had that knew him often commented about his…skill for filling time and paper,” Al-Haitham says. “Apparently even his fellow colleagues and peers in the Vahumana still remember him for it. Half of the books in the House of Daena that he touched had to be replaced immediately because their original contents were no longer legible.” Al-Haitham pauses then stands, moving over to one of his own shelves, raising his free hand up and tracing along several spines before pulling one down. He offers it to Kaveh.</p><p>When Kaveh opens the front cover, he sees the same handwriting in that book as the one the house gave him for Al-Haitham.</p><p>“I was lucky I found them before they were thrown out,” Al-Haitham says. He reaches over and flips towards a part the book where the spine seems to naturally crack to. Al-Haitham taps a little splotch of blue ink just barely visible under black. “If the stories I managed to hear are correct, the blue ink is my grandmother’s best friend. That’s how they met. My grandfather and her best friend argued so fiercely that they met in person and got into a fight. My grandmother stopped them and that’s how they met.”</p><p>“Romantic,” Kaveh says. If only all disagreements within text and letter and academic setting could end so well.</p><p>Al-Haitham takes both books and slides them on their sides onto the shelf, no doubt already mentally rearranging the entire shelf to make room for the new addition.</p><p>When Kaveh returns next, the house lets Kaveh clean up the shattered glass and take away the mangled metal. As Kaveh tells the house about Al-Haitham’s reception of the book, the entire front room lightens once more. And stays light. </p><p>From then on, sometimes the house will quietly, cautiously, nudge something into Kaveh’s view for him to take away to Al-Haitham. The house doesn’t quite open itself up. The hallways and stairways don’t appear unless the house purposefully has something there to show Kaveh. The house remains somewhat cold. Dark. The echoes Kaveh manages to see glimpses of disappear as soon as the house notices Kaveh seeing—evaporating into nothingness or the house closing a door in his face or something like that. </p><p>But now and again, when the times Kaveh brought to Al-Haitham was met with recognition or some kind of comment, and Kaveh brought that back to the house…</p><p>Kaveh could sort of see it. What this place must have once been. When Kaveh speaks of Al-Haitham and his comments, his recollection, about whatever item the house had offered up, the house comes to attention. It brightens. The light turns warm. The wood straightens up, the colors of the house regain their saturation and vibrancy. The air itself changes with anticipation as the house hangs upon Kaveh’s brief words. The house brightens up with the love, the care. And then it will present Kaveh with something else, hopeful, practically dropping whatever item it is on top of him.</p><p>The lightness to the house stays, lingers, layering on top of itself visit after visit. When Al-Haitham doesn’t quite know whatever item was given last, the light dims. But the house has not gotten as dark, as cold, as it was before the blanket. Before the pitaya. Kaveh can now see the details of the front room, the kitchen. The house has allowed him to clean both of dust and check upon the wiring, and do limited tests of the plumbing. Kaveh has even replaced the shattered ceiling lamp. Light switches have appeared on the walls along with other light fixtures. Kaveh has even been granted tentative access to the overgrown fields.</p><p>It recovers so well when it thinks of Al-Haitham. And yet—</p><p>Al-Haitham sometimes still comes with Kaveh to the house. Waiting at the boundary for a few minutes to a few hours. The threshold of jasmine still will not allow him to cross.</p><p>Why does the house forbid him, still? Why does it reject him when it clearly misses him so badly?</p><p>-</p><p>As Al-Haitham has not pressed Kaveh for progress on the state of the house, Kaveh has done his best to not inquire about Al-Haitham’s progress with Kaveh’s father’s belongings. Although, Kaveh supposes that progress on both sides is somewhat tangibly observable without the explanations from each other’s mouths.</p><p>The house in the city has started to become slightly cluttered with the items given by the ancestral house. </p><p>There’s a container of bakhoor that has miraculously survived without going stale or spoiled that’s been slid into a cabinet in the front room when not in use. When Kaveh brought that back and Al-Haitham opened it, it was as though the room suddenly filled with the sound of songbirds and the faint tinkle of a glass wind chime. The air turned warm, almost cloying—sweet with flowers, with sugar, with a strange drowsiness that almost had the both of them falling asleep sitting at the table. Al-Haitham’s not burned any of it, but sometimes he’ll crack the lid open and that alone will be enough to fill the house with a feeling of strange summer contentment. When he does that Kaveh finds himself leaving his door open, just a little bit. And the calculations flow that much more smoothly from his mind to the page, and every line practically lays itself down without need for straight edge of compass.</p><p>The worn quilted blanket is neatly folded on one end of the main divan in the front room. Sometimes when Kaveh passes he’ll reach down and brush his fingers over it. And just faintly, as though he were imagining it, Kaveh can hear children’s voices playing some kind of counting game.</p><p>A few more books—mostly children’s books—now sit on top of the coffee table. When they were given to Kaveh to give to Al-Haitham they all burst open in Kaveh’s hands, each page meticulously hand drawn and detailed with luxurious ink and paint. A history of the family in picture form with simple rhymes. When Al-Haitham opened the books, the pictures moved, the ink glittered, the script of the rhymes seemed to dance as if begging to be read out loud. </p><p>Slowly, piece by piece, the strangely vacant or not-quite-coordinated spaces of the city house are being filled up with items that draw them closer together. Closer to coherent, cohesive, but just shy of it.</p><p>Meanwhile, sometimes when Kaveh returns home or comes out of his room or is moving through the house he’ll hear the muffled sounds of Al-Haitham speaking. </p><p>In the beginning of this Al-Haitham had said that the challenge would be having to convince the Kaveh’s father’s documents to permit Kaveh to read them. Kaveh had not understood it then, he still isn’t sure if he does understand it <em>now</em>. But he supposes that it somewhat makes sense if he tries not to think too deeply on it. And he supposes that this convincing is something that has to be done with word, through debate.</p><p>Kaveh has heard Al-Haitham muttering to himself before, speaking to no one in his study. But Kaveh had thought that he was doing it in the same way Kaveh sometimes talks to himself, or now talks to Mehrak. Like he was bouncing ideas by speaking them out loud, hearing them spoken and checking to see if they sounded as solid and reasonable as they did as simple thoughts when voiced for the world to judge.</p><p>Now, however, with the knowledge of the process that Al-Haitham has pulled back the curtain to reveal, Kaveh can’t help but be curious: do the books talk back?</p><p>“I imagine it will be incredibly painful,” Al-Haitham’s voice is muffled. The door is slightly open, just enough that Kaveh hears him. He can’t tell if Al-Haitham is talking to Kaveh’s father’s books or to one of this other projects. “But nothing was ever gained without some measure of loss. It has been observed by the Amurta on numerous occasions with copious amounts of data to support the conclusion, that in order to heal something it must sometimes be first damaged. Fires to clear the way for new growth, re-breaking a bone that grew improperly, lancing a boil, so on and so forth.”</p><p>Al-Haitham pauses. <em>How</em> does a book talk back? Kaveh imagines it like the houses he’s worked on. But houses don’t have to stick to specific scripts or images, they aren’t bound by their dimensions. Houses have a plethora of ways to talk. Look at Al-Haitham’s house. It throws things, it literally shuts people out, it can convey messages with sight, touch, sound, taste, smell. In comparison to that, how does something that sometimes fits in the size of your palm convey depth of thought and contrast? Especially when it seems to resist wanting to be perceived?</p><p>“No one is ever truly <em>ready</em> for this sort of thing,” Al-Haitham says in response to whatever the document he’s working on has responded. “It isn’t about whether to not it will be pleasant. Or if someone is ready or isn’t. There are some things that just have to happen whether someone wants them to or not. Sometimes it is about need.” And then, revealing what he was working on and making Kaveh turn and walk away in the same decisive and efficient blow, Al-Haitham says very matter-of-factly, without an ounce of softness, “Kaveh needs this. More than anyone. He deserves it, too. Even if he doesn’t want it.” </p><p>It’s strange. Before this exchange of expertise, Kaveh had never really <em>thought</em> about how Al-Haitham’s job worked. Not the one as the Grand Scribe. That one was entirely self-explanatory. But Kaveh means the rather lesser known job as restorer. He’d never thought about what that entailed. He supposed he just thought it meant rebinding books, maybe copying or transcribing pages, undoing security spells, doing little touch ups on color here and there. But Kaveh had never thought of the technicalities of what that meant. Kaveh supposes he’s learning that now. </p><p>Sometimes Kaveh musters up the courage to enter the study when Al-Haitham is working, usually to give Al-Haitham a report on the house, or some other minor update about something else. And sometimes Kaveh asks about what Al-Haitham’s doing.</p><p>Thus far, Al-Haitham has not refused to answer, taking Kaveh’s curiosity with suspicious aplomb.</p><p>Based on the answers given, it is a surprisingly intricate job that requires a startling amount of care and personal thought. In the way that most contrary-to-his-image-things do, it suits Al-Haitham. If Kaveh actually thinks on it for longer than a few moments, and steels himself to think of Al-Haitham and everything the name entails for anything deeper than the surface layer of the past few years of living together.</p><p>The thing with Al-Haitham is that he’s <em>uselessly</em> <em>sharp</em>. Sharp-eyed, sharp-witted, sharp-tongued. He usually uses that sharpness for his own private benefit, but now and again he’ll deign to use that sharpness on someone else and somehow come away surprised when the other person bleeds for it. Would that the world was as sturdy and resilient as Al-Haitham is. Kaveh doesn’t think Al-Haitham has ever flinched in his life. Even now, talking about the house that threw him out as a child, Al-Haitham talks about it like it were a light mystery that’s happening around him and not to him. Talking about the long-lost personal effects of Kaveh’s father is about as ordinary a topic as discussing what should and shouldn’t go into a curry.</p><p>The key component to Al-Haitham’s work, Kaveh has learned, is listening. Al-Haitham is actually quite good at that, even if he doesn’t act like it. Or rather, even if he chooses not to act on the things he listens to.</p><p>This listening involves more than just using his uselessly sharp ears. Because books and papers and documents, for the most part, do not make sounds. If they are making sounds, then you’ve got <em>real</em> trouble. Kaveh did not need Al-Haitham’s expertise to know that.</p><p>In any case, Al-Haitham’s work involves paying a great deal of attention to small details—figuring out the how’s and the why’s of how they came to be present, what purpose they serve (if any), if it would be beneficial in some way for those little details to remain or if they might be removed or modified, so on and so forth. Al-Haitham is very good at that.</p><p>This leads into Al-Haitham having to anticipate future problems. If someone bad or otherwise detrimental caused damage to what he’s working on, how might he reinforce it or protect it from similar damage in the future so that it would not wind up on his desk again? Al-Haitham is good at this, too.</p><p>All of these things can be traced back to understanding the root of a problem, and how that same problem might become reoccurring or manifest in other forms that Al-Haitham would need to attempt to future-proof for, and anticipating any consequences or changes that might come up because of his actions. Al-Haitham is also extremely good at that. Al-Haitham has never suffered an inconvenience he could work around.</p><p>So yes. On paper Al-Haitham is perfect for this job, this role, that requires a very specific temperament and set of skills.</p><p>But in practice, when all of this is translated into much more palatable and understandable verbiage, this is what it means: Al-Haitham has to pay attention to someone else’s feelings and be considerate of them. It means empathy, and sometimes even sympathy. These are things that Al-Haitham is certainly capable of, but not prone towards acting on very often. Because these things usually lead towards kindness, towards softness, towards compromise. These three things exist in Al-Haitham’s vocabulary but are all the more potent for how sparely they’re used.</p><p>Little used, however, does not mean never.</p><p>Kaveh would readily (and grudgingly) admit that Al-Haitham can be all of those things. Sometimes even all at once. Al-Haitham, despite the numerous complaints coming from multiple sources (including Kaveh’s own mouth) that might suggest otherwise, is a good man. He is not a complete and total bastard to be around. He is not some unending torturous pain to be inflicted upon others. It is physically and mentally impossible for someone to be that much suffering constantly. </p><p>Al-Haitham, depending on some rigorous formula that he made up all on his own based on parameters that no one will ever get to find out, now and again chooses to be all of those things: kind, soft, compromising.</p><p>(Kaveh knows this because once, in another life before they became the Master Architect of the Kshahrewar and the Grand Scribe of the Akademiya, they were<em> Kaveh and Al-Haitham.</em> Best friends. But no. Best friends is too anemic a term for what they were to each other. Too superficial.</p><p>Back then it was like they knew each other without words. Something inside of Kaveh looked at Al-Haitham and wanted, desperately, and recognized, wholeheartedly. Something inside of Al-Haitham looked back and must have agreed because despite every single disagreement and all of their differences, they fell into each other as the river meets the sea; as the mountain meets the valley; as a hand meets a hand.</p><p>And being all of that with Al-Haitham, for all of its frustrations—for all of the annoyance, irritation, vexation, and outright bafflement it brought Kaveh, it also brought…well. It brought <em>Al-Haitham.</em> And everything that Kaveh felt that name could mean.</p><p>Or at least. It was that for a little while. In the grand scheme of things, of life, a small fraction of time. A fraction that somehow manages to loom like some terrifying mouth to this day, but in all reality it really was just a tiny little bump in the road.)</p><p>And if Al-Haitham was truly a complete and total bastard, a total pain and poison, it would not have tore Kaveh down to the bone to leave him and be left by him. It would not, still, ache and haunt him to remember what was, and what now is not, and what will never be again because clearly they were both wrong about the other. And what they had (even if that wretched, awful, horrendous blow-up hadn’t happened) would have fallen apart as their misunderstandings of each other fell apart. And that thought, that fact of life, sours the back of Kaveh’s mouth every time he looks at Al-Haitham for longer than a few minutes or dares to think of him as anything more than the man he is today, in this very moment.</p><p>There are things that, once lost, can never be regained or gone back to. Even if they still exist in other forms. </p><p>In this very moment, Kaveh returns—not from the ancestral house, but from a consultation he’s helping one of his peers on—and leans against the doorway of Al-Haitham’s study. Al-Haitham is doing something with some kind of dropper and syringe and several glass vials and tubes. It looks like he’s giving the papers he’s working on a transfusion, of all things. From here Kaveh can see that the pages he’s working on are splayed out over the cleared desktop, placed down on some sort of treated surface and pinned in place. Al-Haitham wears both gloves and a fabric mask over the lower half of his face.</p><p>“And what is this?” Kaveh asks, wondering if he’s about to get a technical answer that’ll make even his eyes glaze over for some riddle of spirit and soul.</p><p>“Refreshing the ink,” Al-Haitham says, “and reinforcing the boundaries of the pages.” Al-Haitham gestures to one pinned document. “That one needs ink matching. It’s distorted itself enough that I’m not sure it’s capable of returning to its original self.” Then he gestures to the one in directly in front of himself. “And this one thought itself to be particular ingenious by gambling on future securities.”</p><p>“You’ve lost me.”</p><p>“I never had you,” Al-Haitham says flatly but without any true heat, gesturing Kaveh to come in and holding out a piece of cloth for Kaveh to cover his nose and mouth with. “You can watch but don’t look at them directly or I’ll lose my progress when they try to hide from you.”</p><p>Kaveh ignores the sting of the words and the futility of them, standing across the desk from Al-Haitham but watching the glass and tubes of ink instead.</p><p>“It’s an advanced technique the certain old books use,” Al-Haitham explains, turning down to continue monitoring the pages. “I’m surprised you father’s documents learned it on their own, considering they were in isolation for so long. Most papers don’t figure it out without outside help. Those that come up with the idea tend to abuse the technique and do it improperly—most will never meet the correct parameters to successfully pull it off long term and they become irreparable. Your father’s papers are like you with that inadvertent lucky streak.”</p><p>Would that my father was instead of his papers, Kaveh doesn’t say. Instead he diverts towards “Books can talk to each other? What’s the technique—the one the papers figured out, I mean.”</p><p>“Talking with each other is a benign way of putting it. They give each other unfortunate ideas. Why do you look so surprised? You’re the one who’s repeatedly pointed out that the point of written communication and recording is communication. What would you expect them to do? Wait for someone to come around to communicate with?” Al-Haitham’s brow raises. “And <em>that</em> look is for what?”</p><p>Kaveh tries to suppress the entirely out of place grin that tries to break over his face.</p><p>“<em>You</em>,” Kaveh says as he fights against the amusement, “of all people shouldn’t be disapproving over unfortunate ideas.”</p><p>Al-Haitham’s eyes flick upwards. “I certainly can when it makes my job harder. As if it weren’t difficult enough to asses these items without their poor self-taught habits interfering.”</p><p>Kaveh gestures for Al-Haitham to continue, hopefully to explain this supposed self-taught habit.</p><p>“What this particular set of notes was doing is a trick mostly done by very old books in a shared setting that face common handling when they don’t like a specific reader. Reference books, old textbooks, popular studies, records of popular plays or poems used in standard curriculums, you get the idea,” Al-Haitham explains, doing something with the page that Kaveh can’t look at. “Because those books know there’s someone else watching after them and is going to fix any damage done, they can be reckless with annoying and chasing off whoever they don’t like. This specific set of notes your father left was swallowing down its own ink and holding it elsewhere. Don’t ask me where. No one’s ever figured out where the papers put it all. But these ones have a leak so overtime it lost its ink. Thankfully the leak wasn’t so bad—it must not have been looked at very much. It’s recoverable. Although it should figure out a safer habit to indulge its insecurities with. It’s interfering with the clarity of the pages now that it’s attempting to be seen. These pages can’t be read even if they wanted to now.”</p><p>Kaveh straightens, torn between hope and frustration, “You were able to read it? It let you?”</p><p>“No. But I don’t need to read it to asses the physical damage and repair it.” Al-Haitham firmly runs the edge of his thumb down a pinned down page, eyes narrowing in concentration as he evaluates the paper by some metric of the craft Kaveh’s not yet been informed of. “I’m not trying to understand its contents. I’m trying to fix the physical embodiment of them and make sure that it’s physically capable of holding it. Whatever it is. When it’s ready, it will be known. In the mean time I might as well make the path towards elucidation as straightforward as possible.”</p><p>Al-Haitham makes a fond little sound in the back of his throat, shooting a glance towards the box of items. “All of this fuss. Definitely your father’s papers.”</p><p>The words leave Kaveh before he can think better of them. “It seems so strange. So…passive. So reliant upon the whims of another. You I mean. I have a hard time imagining you like that. Even though the evidence is right in front of me.”</p><p>Al-Haitham shrugs a shoulder, adjusting something in the flow of the ink. Kaveh leans in closer, still keeping a careful distance from the desk as he watches the page absorb the new ink drop by drop, the calligraphy darkening and turning sharp at the edge as though just written before quietly fading into obscurity so it can’t be read. Kaveh looks away even as Al-Haitham shoots him an annoyed look.</p><p>“Is it not the same with houses?” Al-Haitham asks. “Your consultations? A constant feedback loop of what does and does not work and why?”</p><p>“I suppose. I’ve never thought of the two as the same.”</p><p>“A document houses a thought. A building literally houses most everything else.”</p><p>“Fair. But in my defense, until now I’ve never had any book resist me. One would not expect something like paper to have the strength of stone for defiance. I’d appreciate it if you kept the snark about the pen being mightier than the sword, or water wearing down a mountain to a minimum.” Kaveh pauses. “Or any comments about spines. You can share those terrible phrases with Cyno. The two of you appreciate each other too much, at times, I think.”</p><p>“The General Mahamatra is under appreciated in his time in several areas of regard,” Al-Haitham says dryly. “I’m not surprised you’ve never had a book resist you. You’ve never handled a truly old book. Most books don’t get to be like this for a few decades. It’s like an old house. It takes time.”</p><p>Kaveh moves to lean against the window ledge, lightly pushing it open to get a touch of air in.</p><p>“Why do you suppose my father’s things became like that then? If it takes time? You’re about to say something about the books haven’t talked to you, so how would you know? I mean, in your <em>professional</em> opinion. Why do you think they’re so resistant to be read by anyone to the point that they got lost over it? Why the trouble?”</p><p>“I couldn’t tell you.”</p><p>“Guess anyway.”</p><p>“It’s variable. Perhaps your father’s effects felt they needed to. Perhaps it was some final trace of your father’s last will spurring them to action. It could be some form of self-defense for all we know. It could be anything, Kaveh. Any guess could be a viable answer at this juncture. I have no way of knowing which one is more likely than the other. I wasn’t there when these books were written. I don’t know their context. I don’t know anything about them other than that they were your father’s. And I know nothing of the man. Is it not the same with a building, Kaveh? With a person? You can look at them and talk about them, but you wouldn’t know anything about them without their context, their background. All you’d observe and be able to conclude would be guesswork.”</p><p>“I don’t usually need to converse with a building to see where something’s gone wrong.” </p><p>The conversing and negotiation comes around in trying to <em>fix</em> a problem, not diagnose it. Buildings like Al-Haitham’s ancestral home aside, of course. Buildings, places, that strong of will are rather thin on the ground all over Teyvat. And most of them are not open to study with their own dedicated master to maintain them should anything go wrong. Most families like to keep their business in house, literally.</p><p>In contrast, Kaveh would wager that Al-Haitham deals with materials like Kaveh’s father’s journals and papers with much more frequency than Kaveh deals with strange ancestral homes. </p><p>Al-Haitham’s mouth twitches up at the corner, gaze frustratingly patronizing when he replies, “How fortunate for you.”</p><p>“I’m just—is it <em>truly</em> a conversation? I mean. A back and forth. A prolonged and involved process? How involved can it be with the inherent power imbalance between the participants? How can it be a true conversation when one party is aiming for silence and the other is aiming for answers? It’s more of an interrogation, isn’t it? Especially when the latter has more avenues of action at their disposal, despite the leverage of self-destruction the former has.”</p><p>“At times I forget how deeply and <em>uselessly</em> philosophical you can take even the most simple of concepts,” Al-Haitham muses. “If only you could take that talent of yours and put it to use somewhere. You missed your calling in the Vahumana. I also somehow forgot how impatient you can be.<em> Yes, Kaveh.</em> It is a prolonged and often tedious process that requires a frustrating amount of negotiation of boundaries with a mind that has vastly different perspectives and priorities.”</p><p>“And how does one even begin that?”</p><p>“An introduction doesn’t hurt,” Al-Haitham says. “Or a hello. You’re the one who always goes on about how I’ve no manners and the social graces of a stone at the bottom of a river. <em>You</em> tell <em>me</em> how do you normally start a conversation with a stranger?”</p><p>“The idea that you’re a frequent and adequate conversational partner with<em> paper itself</em> when half the time you turn up your sound cancelling whenever you leave the house to avoid all form of interaction and immediately throw out half your mail correspondences after glancing at the sender is a hard one to reconcile.” Kaveh has to concede though, “It’s just unlike you enough to be entirely like you.” </p><p>How perfectly Al-Haitham for him to find a job that involves conversation and connection with something that does not typically speak or communicate in ways most of the rest of the world does. It’s like how Al-Haitham is with babies and animals, Kaveh supposes—and is summarily surprised with the natural fondness that comes with the thought, so strong it overpowers any exasperation.</p><p>A memory presses forward, pressing and overlapping the present, drawn twice over from the past. The ancestral house had recently shown Kaveh the echoes of ornamental fish, glittering and sparkling to shed illogical rainbows and streaks of colored light upon the ceilings tiles from a small room that led out into an overgrown garden with a fishpond. There were decorative pots for display from Liyue, wide of mouth for the temporary showing off of long-gone fish. But their echoes remained and in the echo a small child leaned over those wide-mouthed pots and the fish swam up in bursts of glittering lights to follow the child’s hand in whatever pattern Al-Haitham might have thought amusing at the time. </p><p>In another echo, Al-Haitham sits in a large aviary and the memories of songbirds in every color dance around him. Finches curl up sweet and docile in his palms. A dusk bird preens his hair. Parrots squeak out phrases of conversation. </p><p>When Kaveh told the house, in halting and not-as-pretty or obviously tender recollections, that this charming peculiarity of Al-Haitham’s has stuck around until adulthood it was like the entire house breathed a sigh of relief. Color and light flooded every room and for a brief moment that made Kaveh’s eyes go wide, Kaveh heard. He heard wind. He heard water. He heard the rustle of branches and grass. Kaveh heard the trill of birds. And the room he was in was full color, clean and clear and warm like summer with the faintest touch of a spring breeze carrying notes of flowers and fields.</p><p>“If it’s unlike me but like me then it <em>is</em> like me,” Al-Haitham points out, reaching up to turn off the various knobs and mechanisms as he starts to move things around, the current treatment apparently over and done with for now. “You’re making it into something bigger than it is. You’re looking into technicalities—<em>very</em> <em>Kshahrewar</em> of you—when all you have to do is take the concept as it is. A conversation is a conversation. It’s just talking, Kaveh. You and I are doing that right now.”</p><p>“The Haravatat telling the Kshahrewar not to look deeper into something? No wonder your Darshan despairs over you. I’m just—how can a conversation happen between entities on equal ground when they are not?”</p><p>Al-Haitham sighs, raising a hand to gesture between them. “Now here is a conversation that would match the level of incredulity you seem to hold towards the technicalities my work. Your father’s affects give me less trouble than you do for all that they refuse to converse. I’ve just told you—it is not that deep. It <em>can</em> be, yes. But not always. Not every single conversation to ever be held is of deep philosophical importance likely to alter the course of one’s life or life views. What did you come in here for anyway?” Al-Haitham steps away from the desk, pulling the cloth from his face and pulling his gloves off. “I doubt it was with the intent on interrogating me on the ethics of communication with intent of some form of gain or victory with a subject that’s based on a different system of existence and perception. Was there something important you wanted?”</p><p>Kaveh blinks, mind going blank. What did he come in here for? He doesn’t remember if there was anything, actually. He was curious, he had the time, so he just…came over. Kaveh walked into the house and his feet mindlessly took him tot he right instead of the left and he was standing at the door, listening, then he was opening the door, talking. He wasn’t exactly thinking about it. It just happened.</p><p>Not that Kaveh’s going to <em>say</em> that, of course.</p><p>But before Kaveh can defer and make an excuse to leave and shut himself in his room, he feels a strange prickle of discomfort in his palms and back of his throat, holding him back from speaking. Al-Haitham is busying himself with putting away his tools, cleaning away the tubes and vials and leftover ink, now and again glancing towards the freshly treated papers spread out on his desk. He doesn’t ask Kaveh again or prompt him, seemingly content to wait. Or maybe even expecting Kaveh to just leave.</p><p>Kaveh doesn’t want to leave. He has no idea where their current topic is going other than in circles, but…it’s not unpleasant. Kaveh doesn’t want to stop just yet. It feels like he’s just warming up, like they’re just getting into the pattern of it—of something. It feels like when Al-Haitham opens that container of incense and the house fills with contentment and everything flows smooth and clean without a single hitch or hiccup.</p><p>And so, spurred by this strange feeling, this peculiar wanting, Kaveh somehow finds himself answering, “I was going to ask if you want to have dinner together.”</p><p>Al-Haitham’s hands, for a moment, look like they go still. Or maybe it’s a trick of light and oxygen deprivation as Kaveh’s mind rapidly scrambles to figure out where that sentence just came from. <em>Dinner?</em> Of all the ridiculous—</p><p>“Don’t we have dinner together anyway? Why do you have to ask?” </p><p>“I mean. Let’s make it together.” Kaveh’s mouth just keeps going even as Kaveh mentally gapes at himself, astounded as coherency somehow manages to string itself together without any conscious input on his part. Coherency yes, but not much in terms of reason or sense. Al-Haitham looks as perplexed as Kaveh feels. “Make it together, eat it together. Sitting at the same table and making eye contact and everything.”</p><p>Al-Haitham just stares at him, head slowly tipping to the side, eyes squinting at Kaveh like he’s hit upon a stumbling block of grammar, syntax, and poor calligraphy. “What problem have you gotten yourself into now?”</p><p>“What? No. There’s no problem. Do I have to have a problem to eat dinner with you?” </p><p>“Historically, yes. If it’s just you and me.”</p><p>Kaveh opens his mouth to protest but…well. Al-Haitham’s not wrong. There are moments of peace that they share where they quietly coexist together and do the same thing in the same vicinity. Like eat. Or read. These moments are not exactly rare—especially not in more recent times—but usually if Kaveh is he tries to limit himself to his room working or just…elsewhere in the house trying to avoid a fight or other unnecessary collisions of tempers. Also by working. Doing chores. </p><p>The exception being when Kaveh’s particularly stressed by something: a project, a person, a philosophy, maybe all of the above at once.</p><p>“I just—it’s dinner. You know. Food.”</p><p>Somehow Al-Haitham sounds even more disbelieving when he asks, eyes still narrowed, “Here?”</p><p>“No, we’ll go invade <em>someone else’s</em> house to cook and eat. Yes, obviously, <em>here</em>. Why are you being strange about this? We have dinner together all the time.”</p><p>“Yes. That’s what I’m saying. We have dinner together anyway, so why are you <em>asking</em>? You know my schedule. I’m not otherwise occupied tonight and neither are you.”</p><p><em>Exactly so, how is it different?</em> Kaveh asks himself.</p><p><em>Because,</em> some quiet and solemn part of Kaveh’s mind answers,<em> you never explicitly asked for him to join you before. It just happened. You never invited it. Never welcomed it. You told him to be there; you would cajole and taunt, but you would never ask. You both just allowed events to unfold around you without ever speaking of them. It’s different because you are asking for it. Acknowledging it rather than leaving it to obscurity. You want it, and you are saying you want it. And if he says yes, then he wants it too.</em></p><p>How uselessly complicated. How utterly appropriate for them.</p><p>Kaveh’s mouth, thankfully, has enough independent sense not to say any of that out loud. </p><p>Instead Kaveh feels a veneer of confidence that almost feels like it fits sliding over his shoulders and drawing his spine straight. Kaveh still doesn’t know where the words are coming from, but as he speaks them he finds that they feel right and by the end of it he’s almost smiling, laughing at Al-Haitham’s baffled look. How strange. How delightful.</p><p>
<em>How them. </em>
</p><p>“What does it matter <em>why</em> I’m asking?<em> I’m asking.</em> Isn’t that all that matters here? And you’re acting weird about it enough that I’m almost regretting it. I don’t. After all of these years I should have expected that it would be such a production to ask a Haravatat anything. Come on. We’ve got that bread you made a few days ago right? Let’s have fattoush. What’s that look for? Now <em>you’re</em> the one thinking too hard about it. It’s just dinner, Al-Haitham. Like you said, we have dinner together all the time? If you don’t want to, then don’t. Aren’t you the free-spirited one between us, beholden to nothing but his own interests?”</p><p>“I didn’t say <em>that</em>,” Al-Haitham says, blinking rapidly as he composes himself with a small shake of his head. He follows Kaveh out of the study, falling into step with him as they walk through the house to the kitchen. “We don’t have enough vegetables for fattoush.” </p><p>“How can we not have enough vegetables? We live in Sumeru.”</p><p>“And does that mean the vegetables walk themselves into the kitchen and place themselves on the cutting board? We have chickpea, eggplant, and maybe half a carrot. You start with the chickpea and see what meat there is to eat with it. I’ll season and toast the bread. Where's that wine vintage the house gave you a few days ago? Did you finish it all when I wasn’t looking?”</p><p>“The one you didn’t like? The one from the year your father graduated the Akademiya? Of course I didn’t finish it all, what kind of boor do you take me for? I’ll season, I’ll season. You either make it too bland or too much. Where’s your moderation at?”</p><p>“Wherever you misplaced yours, where else?”</p>

<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Sometimes it’s easy. Lately, Kaveh will admit it’s been getting easier. Over time the two of them have found careful and neutral ground to coexist on. It’s always a struggle, always a fight, to stay there.

<p>Working with Al-Haitham’s house is not Kaveh’s only project. It’s certainly one of the more challenging and time consuming ones, and one that he’ll admit he has a great deal more investment in than others. But it is not one of the ones paying the bills, and inspiration rarely feeds the stomach in a timely manner.</p><p>There’s Kaveh’s classes at the Akademiya; his side-project tutoring the kids down in Port Ormos (mostly done by mail now, as he can’t manage the constant trip back and forth); consultations and coordinating with the other professors over studio-times, exhibitions, practicals, and demonstrations; and of course his own private commissions because he’s only a part-time lecturer and he literally cannot imagine the kind of workload he’d have to be doing if he was full-time. How do any of the other professors find <em>time</em> to do anything?</p><p>Then again, he supposes other professors aren’t several billion mora in debt with reputations like his to struggle to maintain. Also. Tenure probably helps.</p><p>He’d been tossing and turning in bed trying to sleep because the last thing anyone wants is the supposedly very famous, very clever, very in-demand Master Architect of the Kshahrewar showing up with bloodshot eyes, dark circles, and a frightful pallor. But every time Kaveh closed his eyes some thought would dive out of the dark, snapping its flashing teeth on the back of his eyelids causing him to open them to make sure there wasn’t actually anything coming for the throat.</p><p>He had stacks of papers to look over (he had somehow forgotten that for every assignment he gives his students he has to grade them and return them), letters to respond to, his own personal projects to work on, so on and so forth on the professional side. On the more personal side—</p><p>Well. His mother had written him and he’d dawdled over opening the letter for about half a day, and then he was confronted with the truly unpleasant taste of some of his cohort asking him how he managed to be so <em>perfect</em> while they were in their cups, so he went home and opened his mother’s letter rather than think of all the ways he is very much <em>not perfect</em> and barely keeping his head above any form of acceptable water-line. </p><p>And then there’s Senior Faruzan who’s been trying to pull him aside for a one-on-one. She means well and Kaveh finds working with her to be a truly educating and eye-opening experience. But he simply doesn’t have the <em>time</em> for it; or the money to fund such an expedition and he couldn’t possibly <em>ask</em> <em>her</em> to foot that; and also she’d paid for their last two—no three—luncheons together despite his best efforts.</p><p>He’d begged off of dinner plans with Tighnari and Cyno too many times in close succession for his own comfort. As much as Kaveh doesn’t like to meet with them when he was busy or otherwise torn so many directions (he’s too liable to slip up and say something too horrifically honest, so honest it might come out still bloody and sniffling) it’s just as bad not to see them <em>at all</em>. There’s only so much Kaveh is willing to sacrifice and he has to draw the line at his connections to some of the kindest, most passionate people in his entire life.</p><p>And of course, there’s Al-Haitham. And all of that. What happened, what happens, what continues to happen, what will continue to happen, what will never happen, so on and so forth until the day they’re both in the ground for good. </p><p>And part of Al-Haitham is that house. That country estate with its massive grounds and the mystery of how something so clearly full of love could have become so…well. <em>That</em>. Kaveh’s made little to no progress in understanding the why of it. The house remains entirely mum on the subject. This is not to say that there’s no progress in the house at all. Kaveh has managed to convince the house to let him wander through it in attempts to find more things to bring Al-Haitham. It has also allowed him to do some small revisions, some cleaning, some perusing of his own through its records and storage rooms to try and find information of his own.</p><p>The house, the more Kaveh visits, seems to warm. He doesn’t think he’s imagining it at all. The air is still…somewhat <em>still</em>. The courtyards and gardens and fields are still a mess of aggressive fecundity and melancholy fallowness. There are hallways and rooms and strange patches of wall or floor that refuse to let light shine upon them. Kaveh has yet to create a complete or even partial and reliable layout of the floor plans for the house. Not even the first floor. There are cold spots in the house that remain uncomfortable even if Kaveh uses a warming crystal. Sometimes, the haunted face of clay and shadows watches Kaveh from the depths of the dust. There is obviously grief, some underlying issue that the house refuses to bring to the surface. </p><p>And it is undoubtedly this very same issue that’s the reason for why Al-Haitham cannot cross that jasmine threshold.</p><p>For all that this house seems perfectly willing and able to throw pieces of itself at Kaveh to bring to Al-Haitham, and how it seems to want (to desire) any form of information on Al-Haitham, and how it seems to practically dissolve into light when Kaveh tells it of how those pieces of itself have been folded into Al-Haitham’s house and life in Sumeru City, all attempts Kaveh has made at trying to get it to tell him why it exiled Al-Haitham and refuses to lift that decree have been met with silence.</p><p>Here is the puzzle that Kaveh’s mind returns to. Over and over again. There’s some critical piece of evidence that Kaveh is missing, or perhaps has not looked at from the right angle. There’s no point in asking Al-Haitham about it. It’s the house or nothing.</p><p>Kaveh presses the heels of his palms to his face. He’d managed to get to sleep for a while, but he woke up perhaps an hour ago (time moves strangely in the night hours when one is attempting to sleep but is denied at every turn) and hasn’t been able to manage it again. To the side of the room where his desk is set up the piles upon piles of work loom like a little kingdom. All around the room, wherever Kaveh glances, even in the dark without the details of themselves visible, Kaveh’s mind automatically fills in all of the problems, all of the things yet done, that have literally come to sit in this space and wait him out.</p><p>There are dozens of studies and lectures about how a room is set up and divided and how it effects the mind. Kaveh’s even given a few lectures on that. But here he is falling to the same pitfalls he’s warned against.</p><p>He sits up, running a frustrated hand through his hair for the nth time as he stares out into the dark that patiently watches back, knowing that it is inevitable and inescapable.</p><p>“Damn you.” Kaveh groans, a slight headache forming behind his eyes as he pushes himself out of bed and across the room. He flicks the desk light on with no small pit of resentment and resignation building in the back of his throat as he pulls his student’s assignments forward. If he’s going to be awake and haunted then he might as well try to do something productive about the haunting, if the wakefulness refuses to be solved.</p><p>He sits at the table, head hurting with thoughts and worries and anxieties eating at his shadow as he forces his mind towards academics. It works. It usually does.</p><p>Kaveh makes his way through his student’s basic essays. He reads through a few of the consultation letters sent to him by his peers. Kaveh even makes a nice dent in the reading he’d meant to do to keep himself on top of things in regards to new techniques and research coming out of the Kshahrewar research branch. </p><p>He gets deeply invested in a preliminary paper that one of the other professors sent him—not for review or anything, just to read—because it’s novel. It’s fascinating. But there’s something off about it. Some leap in logic that Kaveh can sense but it’s been ages since he’s had to actually explain his processes so he can’t quite recall the words for it. He knows that he has a reference book around somewhere that has exactly what he means written out perfectly clearly. Except no, he lent it out. He must have some other books that reference the same subject, right? Or at least, follow through on similar enough subjects that he can use them in lieu of the more succinct one.</p><p>Kaveh digs through all of his notes, but he can’t find anything. He can’t find the right ones. Where did he put them? He’s not imagining it. Kaveh’s creative but he can’t conjure a whole set of studies and field of research by himself while sleep deprived. That would simply be too much.</p><p>It’s too much.</p><p>He leans against the edge of a storage box, head in his hands and aching. He’s got several boxes around him, open and rifled through and he can’t find it. Now Kaveh’s going to have to put them back and he’s got nothing for it but the mess and the waste of time. This is going to drive him insane.</p><p>Before Kaveh realizes it, he’s back on his feet. He’s pushing the door of his room open and he’s walking down the hall of the sleeping house, leaving the mess behind.</p><p>Kaveh paces the front room, focusing on breathing and quieting his mind. His head hurts. His eyes ache. He feels simultaneously like he wants to throw up and like he’s parched. He’s too hot, which is strange because normally he suffers from the opposite. He’s a mess is what he is, and Kaveh has to bite his knuckles to stop himself from laughing out loud at that.</p><p>As Kaveh paces in the dark front room, a cool cup of water pressed to his forehead as he tries to scour his memory for the words, the title, the author, the anything, his eyes rove over Al-Haitham’s shelves. It’s not like there’s much else to look at. </p><p>Back and forth, back and forth, Kaveh paces from one end of the front room and hallway to the other. As he walks his eyes move mechanically over the same shadows, the same blocks of light and dark formed by the moonlight coming in through the windows. Al-Haitham didn’t close the curtains or shutters again. Although Kaveh supposes he can’t complain because otherwise he wouldn’t be able to see anything in here without turning on a light. And somehow turning the light on seems like defeat in some sort of fight he’s not sure he’s having or with whom.</p><p>Eventually Kaveh’s mind gets too fretful over the straight line so Kaveh’s pacing deviates until he’s walking the edges of the hallway, the front room, in and out of the moonlight. He’s calmer now. It’s helping. But Kaveh knows that if he goes back to his room now it’ll just start up all over again and then he’ll be back out here all the more frustrated for it.</p><p>As Kaveh walks through the night, his eyes pick up on the useless little details. The shape of the folded quilted blanket hanging off of the back of a divan, which he picks up to fold properly and put down. And then ends up pulling around his shoulders as the night chill starts to settle in like it normally does. The blanket smells warm, which isn’t really a smell but also is. For all that it’s so soft that it’s almost slippery, the blanket stays around Kaveh’s shoulders without him holding it there. </p><p>Kaveh smells, faintly, not the bakhoor from the ancestral house—well. Yes. Kaveh pauses, breathing deep through his mouth. <em>Yes</em>. There’s that. Faintly. Al-Haitham must have opened it up recently. But there’s also the smell of something else. Something that matches that incense but isn’t it. Ah. Roses. Kaveh smells roses. It’s that time of year isn’t it? Kaveh turns towards the windows that look out to the small courtyard framed by the house and realizes that one of them is slightly opened. That’s where it’s coming from, the roses.</p><p>When Kaveh goes to close it his eyes catch on a pile of books. Al-Haitham has a small reading table towards the back of the front room. He mostly uses it to store his overflow of books. Al-Haitham claims it’s his to-be-read pile. And that he moves through it fast enough that Kaveh shouldn’t complain. To that latter claim Kaveh will concede. However, Kaveh would refute the former by saying the <em>entire house</em> is Al-Haitham’s to-be-read pile and that he might consider slowing down on the acquisitions before they get an inquisition from the Matra. Kaveh’s not so sure that Cyno would let this many questionably acquired books slide, even with the relaxing of laws and restrictions on physical books in Sumeru.</p><p>There’s a book open on the table now. Kaveh’s eyes pause over it as he’s reaching over the table to close the window. It looks like some sort of tolerance table. Kaveh squints down at it, pushing the window open further to let in clearer light that isn’t tinted by the color of the glass. It is a tolerance table, liberally annotated. The notes are faded and scribbled over a few times, but it looks like someone was using this table to run experiments and was testing and correcting validity as they were going. </p><p>Kaveh finds himself sitting down, flipping through the book. It’s a Kshahrewar manual. An old one from way before Kaveh’s time. There’s a few errors that the person annotating didn’t catch. Kaveh’s hand itches for a pencil. He blindly opens a drawer, reaching in and finding one immediately. Kaveh writes in minor corrections to the numbers, slowly going through. There’s not much to correct and it’s mostly because of advancements in technology and research. Otherwise the comments written here are quite novel. Advanced for their time. The person who wrote in this manual was a visionary for the time period.</p><p>Before he realizes it, Kaveh’s going back to the front of the manual to see what else is written. Then he’s reaching over to the stack which has more Kshahrewar texts and reading through those too. It’s the same person writing in all of them and Kaveh is absolutely riveted. They build upon and reference the other notes often. Kaveh starts arranging the open books on the surface of the table, hopping between pages, chapters, books. Tracing the path of this person’s thoughts is fascinating. The leaps sometimes seem nonsensical but upon closer inspection are quite sharp, astute to the point of insanity really. Kaveh <em>loves</em> it. If only they had more people like this in the Kshahrewar.</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>Kaveh blinks, startled out of his reading. When he blinks he finds his eyes sting something vicious, like they’re dry. They are. They must be. It’s morning. Was—was he sitting here reading<em> all night?</em> Kaveh looks around, shaken out of his daze of concentration. Archons he must have been. And he’s made quite a mess. There’s more books here than he remembers starting with. He must have gotten up at some point to find and search out the others. As Kaveh takes a quick, more coherent, glance over some of the books he can confirm that. Some of these are from Al-Haitham’s shelves and Kaveh marked those up when he was trying to figure out the connections referenced in the others.</p><p>He turns and looks behind himself. Al-Haitham is standing where the hallway to the kitchen and their rooms opens up into the main room. He’s still sleep rumpled, hair tousled, eyes squinting in confusion because he’s never truly awake until he’s halfway through his morning coffee.</p><p>Kaveh then turns to look at the absolute mess of books he’s made, mortified to realize that he marked up Al-Haitham’s books like he was going through public documents in the House of Daena. Some of these, Kaveh realizes with the clarity of morning shining upon him, are Al-Haitham’s family’s books. They must be. Kaveh even recognizes one of them now that he’s actually looking with his Kaveh-brain instead of his Kshahrewar one.</p><p>“Sorry?” Kaveh says, the word fluttering through the morning like a confused moth.</p><p>“What for?” Al-Haitham sounds even more confused than Kaveh does. Kaveh can’t tell if it’s because he’s not fully awake yet or something else.</p><p>Kaveh gestures to the sprawl of books in front of himself and the empty spaces on the shelves he must have pulled them from. “Reading your books?”</p><p>Al-Haitham’s confusion makes him look about ten years younger, which is absolutely criminal. And also terrible for Kaveh’s heart. It brings him too close to the echo that stands at the edge of Kaveh’s sensibilities.</p><p>“What else would you do with them? Build a house? If I didn’t want you reading them, I would have told you. Besides, don’t you know by now that if a book doesn’t want to be read it won’t be?” Al-Haitham shakes himself out of his confusion, walking over to lean over Kaveh’s shoulder. </p><p>“And…writing on them?” </p><p>Al-Haitham laughs, soft from the morning and the sleep. “Of course you did. Hardly a crime in Sumeru. We’d both be in shackles if so. Well. Let’s see what the Light of the Kshahrewar deigned to illuminate for those passed.”</p><p>“Why do you have so many Kshahrewar books anyway?” Kaveh asks, moving over so they can share the bench and the light.</p><p>“You’re the one who brought most of these from the other house,” Al-Haitham points out, scanning over the open pages, flipping a few back to check context, or lifting some up to read the covers. “The rest I acquired when I was a student. Or otherwise.” Kaveh translates that to questionable means that would have Cyno incredibly annoyed. “Most of them are reprints that had some sort of error, or copies the House of Daena couldn’t use anymore.” Al-Haitham taps the one of the books that Kaveh presumably brought from the other house. “But these are originals. The original copies of my grandmother’s research that she edited before sending off for final publication. I haven’t had time to go through them yet. How do you find it?”</p><p>“Engrossing. Have you ever read her work? Her notes?”</p><p>“Her work, yes. I bought the official publications and the related critiques and other articles,” Al-Haitham says, tracing his fingertips over the older pages before himself. “But I never saw her notes myself. Tell me about what she said here. What were you even looking up to start with?”</p><p>Kaveh leans forward, pushing Al-Haitham’s hands away so he can start bring them back to the single beginning point that sprawled out into this giant mess. Al-Haitham listens along, the two of them going back and forth with more questions as new ideas and curiosities spring up. One of them must have found some scratch paper, because surrounded in a half-circle of precariously stacked books, Kaveh finds himself diagramming out one of the concepts while Al-Haitham flips between different pages illustrating counter-arguments—the both of them trying to understand his grandmother’s commentary on both which is far above both of their combined heads.</p><p>(And also not helped by her startlingly <em>questionable</em> penmanship.</p><p>“She was a Kshahrewar <em>theorist,”</em> Al-Haitham rolls his eyes as Kaveh holds a page up so close to his face he thinks he’s going cross-eyed. “Of course her handwriting was terrible and full of nonsense abbreviations that no one would ever be able to parse.”</p><p>“What’s that supposed to mean? My handwriting isn’t like this!”</p><p>“You’re an <em>engineer</em> and <em>architect</em>, not a <em>theorist</em>.”)</p><p>If interrogated by the full powers of the Corps of Thirty, Matra, and Lord Kusanali herself, Kaveh wouldn’t be able to say how they go from sitting there side-by-side to sitting side-by-side at the kitchen table with breakfast and books before them like the most decadent breakfast spread that not even the grandest hotel could beat. Kaveh wouldn’t be able to say where the food came from or who made it, except it must have come from <em>them</em> because they’re certainly washing the dishes and putting away the scraps for composting and leftovers for later now.</p><p>“Why did you have her books out anyway?” Kaveh asks as they’re in the middle of washing the dishes and wiping the kitchen down. It’s strange. Kaveh would swear that they’re moving much faster than normal. Is it because they’re both in a good mood (for once)? They’ve washed and dried dishes together before. Why does it seem…better? Is the lack of sleep making time go strange again?</p><p>Al-Haitham tips his head, handing Kaveh the cutting board he’d just finished rinsing. “I didn’t. You’re the one who pulled them down, you said.”</p><p>“No. Well. Some of them, but not <em>all</em> of them. They were on the reading table with your to-read pile. That first one was out and it caught my eye last night when I was having trouble sleeping. I got distracted by it and just ended up going through all of them.”</p><p>“It’s true that I put some of them there. But I didn’t have any of them open. And they were rather towards the back. It takes more of my focus to read through those kind of books,” Al-Haitham says with a small shake of his head. He rests his forearms against the edge of the sink, expression turning contemplative. “You couldn’t sleep?”</p><p>“That’s not new for me. Don’t be surprised.”</p><p>“What was your problem?”</p><p>Kaveh’s mouth twists down as he wipes some spilled water at the edge of the counter. He shakes his head, somewhat rueful.</p><p>“I was grading papers, actually.” Kaveh lets out a quiet groan when remembers the mess he’d left in his room last night. He’s going to have to sort that out before he tries getting an hour or two of sleep before going out for the consultation later. “And one thing led to another, and then I was reviewing the preliminary draft for a peer’s student’s thesis, and I had something I needed to correct but I didn’t have the right references and I couldn’t find any similar ones either. It was driving me madder than I normally am. I was walking around the house to try and clear my head or wear myself out enough to fall asleep. I saw the books and now here we are. I actually do have a much better answer and note to write in response to that student now. But I certainly didn’t pull those down. I only had half an idea of what I was looking for and we both know that clarity is one of the first things to go for me when I’m caught up in the night’s moods.”</p><p>Al-Haitham, in response to that, just nods. Like this makes sense. Perhaps Al-Haitham is feeling the strangely pleasant mood of the morning because he even deigns to explain himself. Even though it doesn’t feel like much of an explanation.</p><p>“Then it was just the house again, wasn’t it?” Al-Haitham lightly shakes water from his hands, taking the towel from Kaveh’s to properly dry off. Mystery solved. But <em>no</em>, because Kaveh doesn’t know how<em> that’s</em> supposed to be an answer.</p><p>“What house? Your family’s house? How could your family’s house know I was having some sort of trouble from all the way out there?” Sure, Kaveh’s brought several items over that have integrated well enough here. But that wouldn’t necessarily mean that the house’s consciousness has moved over. Kaveh’s never heard of such a thing.</p><p>“No. <em>This</em> house,” Al-Haitham says, shooting Kaveh a suspicious look, like he thinks Kaveh’s up to something. “Why would my ancestral home know about <em>your</em> problems? Of course I mean this house. What other house are you having your nightly crises of philosophy and capitalism in?”</p><p>At Kaveh’s blank look Al-Haitham turns to face him fully, his own expression growing slightly exasperated, as though the effort of having to explain the mysteries of his mind is a hindrance.</p><p>“The house,” Al-Haitham says, “helped you. Like it always does.”</p><p>“What are you talking about?”</p><p>“You can’t tell me that you’ve not noticed it.” Al-Haitham reaches out and tugs at—the blanket still on Kaveh’s shoulders. Despite the fact that he’s not holding it and has been moving around quite a lot. “The house—<em>this</em> house—acts. It helps. Or at least, it tries to when it can.” Al-Haitham lets out quiet click of his tongue. “<em>Think</em>, <em>Kshahrewar</em>. The almost empty bag of coffee beans that somehow lasts just long enough for your next free day to buy more. The water that’s somehow perfectly cool without being stale even though it’s been out for hours. Lost items turning up not where you expect. Reaching into a drawer or cabinet and the item you need being the first thing you touch. The classic hallmarks of a place gaining consciousness.”</p><p>“It’s too soon,” Kaveh says even as his mind starts to draw up several incidents just like the ones Al-Haitham is listing. “This house isn’t even a decade old in construction.”</p><p>But now that Al-Haitham has pointed out Kaveh’s mind keeps piling on evidence. Al-Haitham’s suggestion becomes less of a suggestion and more of a proven fact. The house is entering the beginning stages of developing the characteristics of heart. Thought.</p><p>How? When?</p><p>Kaveh raises a hand to his mouth, mind spinning as little moments jump to the forefront of his mind. </p><p>The bed-sheets somehow being the perfect temperature when he comes back from a long trip, the air in the room not being stale at all. He’d assumed Al-Haitham aired the room out, but then again—why would Al-Haitham do that? Kaveh certainly doesn’t do that for Al-Haitham’s room when the other man’s away on business. And then there’s the fact that somehow despite his numerous accidents, none of the furniture in his room has been stained or otherwise damaged. He’d always thought it was luck or him being particularly good at cleaning. Not quite as stand-out but still something to consider—how Kaveh can find his way in the darkest parts of the night with the barest bits of reflection and light without any trouble. Or the way that sometimes when he comes back late or leaves very early and he’s trying to be quiet the doors and floors are perfectly mute when at other times they have slight creaks and clicks.</p><p>There are the times when Kaveh is so into it that he’s forgotten something or is ignoring something that he really shouldn’t (like him leaving something on the stove or the windows being open and a sudden rain coming) he’ll suddenly be snapped out of it and alerted to the imminent danger just before it gets to the point of an incident. There was one time when a strong storm knocked a window open and started to blow in puddles of rain into the front room. Kaveh had been dead asleep—worn out entirely from just returning from a long trip and several hours of post-research-trip debrief at the Akademiya. Kaveh wouldn’t be able to say what woke him, other than he was suddenly awake and standing in in that puddle and then panicking as he quickly set about shutting and securing the window, then cleaning up the rainwater. The rainwater that he remembers felt like it took ages to get rid off, despite the seeming shallowness of the puddles.</p><p>Miraculously, nothing inside the house got water damage. But perhaps that wasn’t the miracle. No. It was not a miracle. It was on purpose.</p><p>Then there’s the little moments Al-Haitham listed, which must mean he’s experiencing it too. It’s not just isolated to Kaveh or Al-Haitham, it’s both of them. It’s the entire house.</p><p>“When did you start noticing that?” Kaveh asks. “How long has this been going on for?”</p><p>Was it when he started bringing items over from Al-Haitham’s ancestral home? It’s true that Kaveh noticed this house changing, becoming more cohesive, more welcoming from the little touches of history and comfort. But that doesn’t match the timeline, does it? But what else could have jump-started the process? The magic and life that lives in Al-Haitham’s ancestral home goes back centuries. Surely that would be enough to get the process of growth and sentience moving along faster in a new place.</p><p>“A while,” Al-Haitham shrugs, looking like he can’t decide if he’s annoyed that Kaveh’s just picking up on the improbable now or entertained.</p><p>“And what’s a while?”</p><p>Al-Haitham turns away to finish wiping down the counters. Kaveh opens his mouth to call the man out on ignoring him, but Al-Haitham’s head slowly tips back, eyes traveling over the ceiling. Kaveh’s mouth closes as he recognizes the look of thought, genuine deep thought and concentration settling over Al-Haitham’s body. Kaveh waits.</p><p>“I was not actively keeping any form of record on this, so I cannot say it with any certainty,” Al-Haitham finally says. His eyes are still locked towards the ceiling, narrowed in concentration as he leans his hip against the counter, arms crossing. “But I’ve theorized that it began to shift and change months ago. I didn’t realize what was happening, though, until after the Inter-Darshan competition. It was sometime around the dinner Tighnari hosted to celebrate Collei’s grades. The one that the Traveler and Paimon attended. Senior Faruzan was otherwise occupied. Aside from them it was you Tighnari, Cyno, you, and me.” Al-Haitham nods to himself, lowering his eyes from the ceiling as he returns to more solid and certain understanding instead of theory. “That is around when the house’s behaviors became more overt. Prior to then they were much more subtle.”</p><p>Kaveh frowns. That long?</p><p>“How come I never noticed?” Kaveh asks this mostly to himself, not expecting Al-Haitham to answer, if he even had one.</p><p>But he does. Because Al-Haitham says, “I suppose the fault isn’t exactly with you. How could you have noticed something you can’t see?”</p><p>“What’s <em>that</em> supposed to mean?” It’s literally Kaveh’s <em>job</em> to notice things about houses. Buildings. Structures.</p><p>“Exactly what I just said. You can’t notice something you don’t see.” Al-Haitham gestures around them with a lazy wave of his hand. “You’re normally shut up in your room with your head buried in work or doing your best to not be here at all. When you weren’t doing those things and busying yourself with chores that no one asked you to do, you weren’t exactly taking your time to look around at where you were.”</p><p>Al-Haitham tells Kaveh this with all of his usual self. Blunt honesty without a single care as to how the words land, one way or another, content with the fact that they are true.</p><p>Truth delivered, Al-Haitham pushes away from the counter, leaving Kaveh to the revelation and the silence that follows it.</p><p>-</p><p>When Kaveh returned to his room sometime later, Kaveh was still holding that revelation in his mouth like a bladed thing. He could neither swallow it nor spit it out.</p><p>Kaveh finished up in the kitchen and put the books back. Despite the fact that he didn’t remember where he pulled them from, it felt as though his hands and eyes were being guided as he put each one back into place. Al-Haitham’s organizational system for his books is some bastard abomination of the House of Daena’s official system, his own personal one, and some other matter of physical space requiring concessions from both other systems in order to get things to work. But as Kaveh put the books back, he found himself looking at their neighbors and realizing he could roughly figure out their connecting themes. He could understand them.</p><p>And then Kaveh moved to set the blanket down and it flowed from his shoulders into his hands like warm water, almost folding itself up into a neat square as he placed it on the divan. When he returned to his room, it was not in the state he thought it would be. There were boxes of his notes open and shuffled around and out of order. But the papers were all neat and ready to be put away. The stacks of assignments he’d went through last night sit in a perfect stack at one edge of his desk. The paper he was reviewing takes center stage right next to a blank and waiting page with a pencil waiting for him to write his commentary. The bed was not made, but the sheets aren’t the frightful tangle he remembers kicking them into.</p><p>Kaveh didn’t have time to process any of that. So he rushed through getting ready for the day, fighting down the growing realization and everything it would mean. As he was getting ready more and more little details leaped out at him that he could no longer ignore. The earrings he wanted were front and center of his small jewelry box. He doesn’t that much in terms of jewelry and luxuries, but Kaveh had not even known he’d wanted this specific pair until he opened the box and there they were shining up at him. His clothes are all perfectly pressed without a single wrinkle or loose stitch. </p><p>When Kaveh returns from his last appointment of the day he sits on his made bed and looks around the room. The window was slightly cracked open when he returned and he knows he didn’t do that. But now the room smells of warmth, of rose, of fresh green. A definite improvement over anything else it could smell like. The bed is warm and soft from soaking in sun. </p><p>He sits at the bed and looks around himself. </p><p>The dinner for Collei, the one the Traveler and Paimon attended, Al-Haitham had said. After the Inter-Darshan competition. That’s when it really became obvious and undeniable.</p><p>There is something else that happened around then that Al-Haitham wouldn’t have known about.</p><p>Kaveh brought out his mother’s belongings. He went through them. And he did not put them away again. His mother’s journal has a place of pride on his bedside table. While it’s still hard for him to respond to her letters, it’s somehow easier to look at her journal entries. It’s a comfort to see that the struggles he faces now are so similar to her own. Seeing that window into this part of her life has been a welcome relief from his own. He has favorite pages from it. There’s a photograph of her that her parents had taken of her at a fancy Kamera studio from when she entered the Akademiya. He has that photograph carefully propped up on his dressing table. Kaveh’s eyes seek it out now.</p><p>The house had slowly been building up, changing, growing over time. But it reached a new developmental stage after Kaveh opened his mother’s belongings. </p><p>What does that mean, that Kaveh’s opening of his mother’s journal and sorting through of her personal effects, gave the house enough of a push that it’s begun showing signs of…well. <em>This</em>? What does it mean that Al-Haitham’s house is doing that? Taking note of Kaveh’s actions and responding accordingly? </p><p>Kaveh’s eyes slide away from his mother’s face towards the walls which are no longer blank and no longer just filled with schedules for payments, meetings, classes, projects, and miscellaneous deadlines. </p><p>Al-Haitham has, actually, made a small amount of progress in getting Kaveh’s father’s things to behave. Nothing to get truly excited for—but a few photographs and scraps of paper that mostly contained sketches or one-off ideas became perceivable. Kaveh took them and stuck them up on the wall. They were beautiful and Kaveh was excited and they just felt like they’d fit.</p><p>Over there, towards the window, is what Kaveh believes to be a test photograph. In his mother’s journal, she notes that his father got an early kamera proto-type for personal use and spent several weeks figuring it out, going through loads of templates and film and chemicals for development. He thinks his father kept some of those poorly taken photographs. They were stuck in between pages of notes and books and the like, Al-Haitham had said. His father was firmly not in the camp of people who dog-eared their books apparently.</p><p>The photograph by the window is horrifically blurred. But somehow, by some fortunate lining up of timing, conditions, and a novice’s luck, Kaveh’s father had managed to catch the image of Kaveh’s mother mid-spin as she dances. Her face, her features, are blurred. But her hair and her skirts fan and billow out around her like flowers, like clouds. It’s beautiful.</p><p>There’s another photograph that’s much clearer. It looks like his father took it on one of his travels, from a great height. The lighting conditions were obviously poor, but it’s still a beautiful picture of the sky. Several clouds are captured with startling weight and presence, for all that they’re of poor detail and there’s nothing else in view. There are a lot of strange landscape photographs like that one. Kaveh honestly can’t even come close to guessing what was going on in his father’s head when he chose to take those pictures. He wonders if they’re even close to what his father thought he was going to get. He’s sure they don’t measure up to what his father actually saw. But they are, mostly, lovely to look at.</p><p>The notes are torn out from other books, newspapers, flyers and the like. On some there are just little scribbles of coordinates. Others are little fragments of thoughts or ideas. Kaveh’s father’s handwriting wasn’t especially neat, and he’s had to go back to Al-Haitham to double check if the calligraphy was really that bad or if it’s acting up. There is not much to these scraps in terms of content or meaning. But Kaveh can’t bring himself to throw them away. There is a little bit of amateur poetry written down on the back of a torn corner of incredibly old flyer for some sort of public debate. His father scribbled over parts of the poem several times and it looks like he never finished it. Kaveh can’t help but find it charming anyway. He’s stuck it up with the photographs and his own papers on the wall.</p><p>The room, with these new additions, feels more…<em>Kaveh</em>. As Kaveh takes that thought and realization in along with the rest, he can recognize it as true.</p><p>He’s getting comfortable here. <em>That’s</em> what it is. Kaveh has, slowly, without truly noticing it, become more and more comfortable here. After the competition, after that dinner and going through his mothers things, Kaveh felt different. Lighter although not better. Kaveh has been spending more time in this house—outside of his room. Outside of the chores he’s taken on for himself. And as a result Kaveh has started to spread out of this room.</p><p>It is not just Al-Haitham’s ancestral house that has been adding itself to this one, Kaveh realizes as he stands up and walks out of his room. </p><p>Here is the painting he hung up. Over there is a table runner that he got as a gift so he put it on the table in the hallway because it looked so bare without. </p><p>This is the picture frame Kaveh found at discount and repaired and restored so it looks like new. There’s a picture of Al-Haitham, Cyno, Dehya, Lord Kusanali, and Candace in it, all huddled around the Grand Sage’s chair. There’s a sign above Al-Haitham’s head that says “Congratulations on the Demotion”. Al-Haitham looks unreasonably smug in it. The Traveler took the picture. Nilou made the sign. Kaveh laughed the entire time through it. Matching it is a simpler frame that has a clipping from a newspaper that shows Kaveh on the final stage at the closing ceremony of the Inter-Darshan competition. It appeared next to Al-Haitham’s demotion picture one day and when Kaveh went to take it away, embarrassed, Al-Haitham stopped him and said, “It only seems fitting that the best days of our lives stand side by side.” And that was that.</p><p>As Kaveh walks out of the hallway into the front room Kaveh sees himself in little spots all around. A mixture of himself, of Al-Haitham, of then and now. There’s a large antique frame that used to house a beautiful charcoal drawing one of Al-Haitham’s ancestors made. The canvas had started to crack and rot, and the charcoal had smeared somewhere along the way. But the frame was still good and with Al-Haitham’s permission, Kaveh took out the old canvas and replaced it. Kaveh had originally meant to just give Al-Haitham the frame, but Al-Haitham said Kaveh could use it for one of the blueprints he saved. Hadn’t Kaveh always meant to hang them up anyway?</p><p>“There’s no room in my room for that,” Kaveh said.</p><p>Al-Haitham gestured around them both. “Is the house one single room? Pick a wall. You already started in with that painting. Why hold back now?”</p><p>Kaveh carefully pulled out his large concept sketch for the bridge of Port Ormos. And then, unsure but somehow amazed at the same time, Kaveh adjusted the frame so that it could hold the paper. And he hung it in the front room.</p><p>A few more of the photographs Kaveh’s father took have made it out here, too, standing propped up against the books on the shelves. </p><p>Among the books scattered around the front room are a few of Kaveh’s own. Kaveh recognizes them now. When did they work their way into these piles? And isn’t that the little toy lion Collei made for him ages ago sitting next to the slate? Kaveh moves to stand in the middle of the room, taking it in for what feels like the first time. As he does it seems to brighten, drawing his eyes to all the little details of where changes have been happening without him realizing despite the part he played in causing them to happen.</p><p>Kaveh looks upon the room with confusion and awe and something vast like a sun ambling over the edge of the world to tip over and set his mind on fire. When did this happen? <em>How</em> did this happen?</p><p>Shouldn’t it be strange, looking out into Al-Haitham’s house—made from the building that Kaveh denied—and seeing himself look back? Perhaps if someone peered in through the window or the door, some stranger to them both, they would just see a regular house that’s just on the sparse side of minimal by the smallest of margins. But if Tighnari looked in? Collei? Cyno? Senior Faruzan? The Traveler? If any of them looked in they’d see. They’d see Al-Haitham all over and these little sparks of Kaveh.</p><p>And as strange as that is, as ludicrous as that should be, Kaveh can’t find it in him to deny it. It’s true. It’s all true.</p><p>Kaveh covers his mouth with one hand as he looks around, eyes not knowing where to linger. The entire feeling of this place has been transformed. A few short weeks ago Kaveh would have described Al-Haitham’s house as impersonal with how little there was in terms of non-practical items, as though Al-Haitham only had the place built to store books and for him to have a shelter to read them in without being disrupted. But look at it.</p><p>
<em>Look at it.</em>
</p><p>This isn’t that. This is so much <em>more</em> than that. It’s more than Al-Haitham. It’s more, even than Kaveh. It’s more than either of them because it’s the both of them. It’s not just the actions of one or the other. </p><p>They did this. Kaveh’s heart squeezes as he moves the hand from his mouth to his eyes, a burst of incredulous laughter spilling out of him. </p><p>How in the world could this have happened without them ever even saying a word about it? How did they do this when they’re so—well. <em>Them</em>? Out of everyone in the world, they would be the last two people Kaveh would ever pick to build a house together. </p><p>If someone had asked the Kaveh of two, three years ago…five years ago, ten years ago, fifteen years ago, if he had ever imagined building a life and sharing it with Al-Haitham, Kaveh would have said no. <em>Impossible</em>. Why would you ask that? Not even the Kaveh of <em>Kaveh and Al-Haitham</em> would have dared to dream upon the borders of something close to this. So how is it possible that after everything that came to pass, that they have arrived here? That they’ve come to this?</p><p>The things you lose can never come back as they were. But they never had this before to lose one way or another. They never had anything close to it. So where did it come from? </p><p>This. The comfort. The beauty.</p><p>The acceptance.</p><p><em>It came from you</em>, the quiet voice from some corner of Kaveh’s soul answers. <em>Where else could it have come from?</em></p><p><em>How though,</em> Kaveh asks himself. <em>How?</em></p><p>
<em>How could it come from me, from him, from us, when at times we can barely look at each other? When every interaction has the looming threat of tipping over into something that can take them apart, flaying them down to the bone and then some?</em>
</p><p>Sometimes it’s easy. Lately, Kaveh will admit it’s been getting easier. Over time the two of them have found careful and neutral ground to coexist on. It’s always a struggle, always a fight, to stay there. But sometimes they accidentally trod upon hidden vipers when their guard lowers, and the venom and the fury snaps out as though it had never left.</p><p>But sometimes, when Kaveh looks at Al-Haitham for too long, and his heart is not ready because its been lulled by this peace—this security—into thinking the rough waters have passed, he’ll see…</p><p>Al-Haitham. And everything that name was. Everything that name could have been to him.</p><p>And it hurts. God. God does it hurt. Kaveh’s heart will remember Al-Haitham and everything they were. For a brief moment it will be as though it were Kaveh’s hands holding that pitaya as it splits open perfect and shining and sweet on the tongue with the bright notes of a smile. It splits open in his palms just for him without him even trying. Like a little secret gift.</p><p>Al-Haitham will laugh, one of those small little laughs that makes his nose wrinkle up and expose just a little bit of his gum as his lips pull back into the shape of a heart. Or Al-Haitham will be nodding along to something someone is saying, his eyes will be closed and the light will catch upon his face just so. Al-Haitham’s eyelashes will brush shadows on his cheeks like bird’s wings. Or Al-Haitham will push his hair out of his face, maybe tucking some of it behind the curve of an exposed ear. </p><p>Age has only made Al-Haitham sharper. More devastating. But there are some parts that remain, that are shared between this Al-Haitham that Kaveh has negotiated neutral ground with and the one that he burned all the bridges with years ago.</p><p>It’s the glitter in his eyes. The obnoxious tilt of his chin. The jut of his hip. It’s in the turn of his hands and the cadences of his voice. They’re still there underneath it all, waiting to be remembered and rediscovered all in one.</p><p><em>And that,</em> that quiet voice says,<em> is what haunts you today. The remembering. The grief of what you weren’t. The remorse over what you ended up becoming. And what you lost of each other in the process.</em></p><p>Yes. This is true. Kaveh presses his eyes into his palm. The grief does remain. For all the progress the two of them have made, for all the changes they have individually gone through—it is still here. </p><p>They sense it when they are caught in moments where they hover over an argument, or the memory of a prior disagreement shoulders its way into the current one. And then, mutually, they have to make the clear and careful, conscious, choice to walk back from it and turn away. Sometimes Kaveh will look at Al-Haitham in those beautiful, glistening moments, and then remember that he lost the right to that. </p><p>Kaveh will remember the sound of paper shredding. The sound of voices echoing over each other so viciously that their originating voices couldn’t be understood. Kaveh will remember holding the shredded papers in his hand and trying to put them back together, knowing they would never be the same. He will remember the official notice he received later—<em>Al-Haitham has struck his name from the thesis.</em></p><p>And the moment will sour, rot. Twist and contort, wrenching itself from Kaveh’s grasp as he remembers the reality of how it all played out. Then there’s the anger. The rage. The memory of the hurt reminding him of all the ways that beautiful thing, that beautiful smile, <em>ruined</em> him. And what kind of idiot would Kaveh be to fall for it again?</p><p>Maybe Al-Haitham has moments like that, too. Moments where he looks at Kaveh and remembers what almost-was. But could never be because underneath it all this is who they were and it would always come to this confrontation?</p><p>So <em>how</em> has it come to be, despite all of this that remains between them that constantly threatens to push them over the tipping point back into the ruin, that this has come to be around them? Why is it now, years later—after it was too late? After they inflicted some of the worst hurt they’ve ever done to another person to each other? Why does this happen now?</p><p>What was so different about them from years ago that they couldn’t have this peace with each other?</p><p>Ah. But there’s the answer isn’t it? <em>They were not peaceful</em>. Neither of them are <em>now, </em>either. Kaveh doesn’t think they’ll ever be peaceful. Al-Haitham might seek peace out, but he’s got too much of a mischievous streak and curiosity and ability to back it all up for real peace. And Kaveh’s Kaveh. </p><p>But back then—they were <em>worse</em>. Al-Haitiham and Kaveh have found their balance as individuals and in this house as adults. Time has tempered them, refined them, honed them. Taught them the hard way. But when they were younger they were all youth, energy, uncompromising ideals.</p><p>And they were grief. So much grief. Kaveh and his father, and the mystery of what happened to him and why that he did not yet have any leads or answers to. Kaveh and his mother, both grieving and trying to pull themselves out of it in their own ways. Kaveh did that by throwing himself into his dream, into the work of building himself into the man he is now. Al-Haitham, then, must have had his grief too. Although Kaveh never asked about it.</p><p>This grief of theirs, the need to escape it…it made them so eager to leap. To run. To move. To fight. How easily grief disguises itself, turning itself into anger, or arrogance. Grief can be used to fuel brilliance for a time. Grief is fuel to keep moving. And if you keep moving without looking back, you’ll never have to face what it cost you.</p><p>How much of their anger comes from grief? How much of themselves had they ruined because of that never-ending spring of it?</p><p>And yet—how much of them managed to survive to somehow create this?</p><p>When Al-Haitham returns Kaveh is sitting in the kitchen. Dinner is just about ready and Kaveh has spent the hours thumbing through his mother’s journal and his father’s photographs. Understanding sits in Kaveh’s chest, shoving aside organs to make room for its improbable self. Kaveh keeps getting distracted, looking up and around like he’s fallen asleep and woken up and can’t believe it. Over and over.</p><p>Al-Haitham returns, not even blinking to see Kaveh or dinner. Al-Haitham just nods at him, going over to inspect the food at the stove before washing his hands and preparing to set the table. When did this happen? When did this become routine, too?</p><p>As they eat Al-Haitham sighs and says, “What’s your problem now?”</p><p>
<em>You, me, us. The usual.</em>
</p><p>“There aren’t any,” Kaveh replies, frowning when Al-Haitham laughs under his breath. “What?”</p><p>Al-Haitham shakes his head, fine mouth faintly curling up in a fond smile as he divides the last portion of the raita—more for Kaveh to temper out the heat—for the last bits of curry.</p><p>“For someone with no problems, you look very displeased,” Al-Haitham answers. “How did it go?”</p><p>“How did what go?”</p><p>“Writing up your response to your peer’s student’s paper.” Al-Haitham looks up at him when Kaveh doesn’t answer. The faint curve of his smile reveals the brightness of teeth, the corners of his eyes crinkling. “You forgot.”</p><p>“Shut up and eat your curry.”</p><p>-</p><p>The ancestral house has gotten to a point where it is now asking things from Kaveh—showing it the hidden parts that it couldn’t preserve on its own, the parts that need extra help. Sometimes this is something as simple as a new coat of paint. Other times it involves Kaveh doing several hours of research on period-appropriate repair techniques for roofing and hoping Mehrak and he can do it themselves because the house still refuses to let anyone in.</p><p>It doesn’t let Al-Haitham in. It doesn’t let hired hands even cross the boundary of the property.</p><p>“I can’t do it all myself, I’m only two hands,” Kaveh exclaimed at that much to Al-Haitham’s bemusement and the hired worker’s confusion. Mehrak made a sharp noise of offense as Kaveh waved off the workers, Al-Haitham following behind him as he went to argue with the house about the feasibility of repairs with just one man doing them all. </p><p>“I have a job! I have <em>several</em> jobs!” Kaveh yelled in the direction of the house as Al-Haitham passed him tools and materials one at a time. “Have a care!”</p><p>The house has also asked him for seeds. Thankfully, it did not require Kaveh to tear up the overgrown gardens or do the digging himself. It just had him set the seeds down in the kitchen and a few days later when Kaveh returned the seeds were gone and a portion of the overgrown courtyard had been tamed into stillness.</p><p>Little by little, the house is emerging from the wilderness, from its self-imposed neglect and isolation. But this means nothing if Kaveh and Mehrak are the only witnesses. It means nothing at all unless one specific person gets to see it.</p><p>But every time Kaveh tries to bring it up, he’s distracted by the house flinging something at him. Be that some new problem it wants him to look at, something it wants him to bring Al-Haitham, or actually chasing him out the door is variable.</p><p>Kaveh has told Al-Haitham what he could of it, the progress. Mehrak’s tried taking pictures but something about the house refuses to be captured in such a way, much to her frustration. She spent an entire three days sulking about it. Al-Haitham has listened to all of Kaveh’s stories of the house and its progress and its sheer stubborn strength of will with a slight furrow to his brow. </p><p>“In all honesty,” Al-Haitham had said when Kaveh asked if he was displeased with the progress, fully ready to launch into one of his multiple appeasement speeches he has ready for his most stubborn and persnickety of clients, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“The house you’re describing, the things you’re describing about it,” Al-Haitham said, “I can’t picture it. Your words are, as ever, graphic and detailed to the point where I have to wonder how much of it is theatrical embellishment and how much of it is true. But I cannot imagine it, the things you speak of.”</p><p>“Oh. If you want I could try to draw it for you.”</p><p>“You could draw anything, Kaveh, and I’d believe it,” Al-Haitham said, turning away from him. “Although I am glad to know you’re having marginally more success than I am.”</p><p>Kaveh has been hesitant to ask for updates on Al-Haitham’s ongoing back-and-forth with the documents. He’s watched Al-Haitham working on them sometimes. Al-Haitham’s offered up small updates when he has them. There are the photographs and the small notes that he gave Kaveh before. But of the major documents there’s been very little in terms of update. </p><p>Al-Haitham has successfully gotten some envelopes and a few of the thinner journals to open. Apparently those journals were only half-filled so there isn’t much for them to hide anyway. Kaveh has heard Al-Haitham arguing with them about that.</p><p>(“You’re hiding literally nothing. Are you embarrassed to be half-finished? Is that the problem? I assure you, of all the things to be self-conscious about, that isn’t one of them. That’s hardly your fault, is it? And Kaveh’s not going to be focusing on blank pages.”)</p><p>But whenever Kaveh gets too close or they notice him, they all slam shut again. Kaveh’s asked Al-Haitham if the books have at least deigned to give Al-Haitham a glimpse of their contents. If Al-Haitham could read it he could tell Kaveh what was in there. It’s not ideal and Kaveh might bite his tongue off from the envy and the resentment, but it would be one solution to the problem. And it would be over. Finally. But the books remain unreadable to Al-Haitham, too.</p><p>Al-Haitham has managed to convince a few more loose pages and letters to be legible to Kaveh, but most of them weren’t of any real consequences. Half-sketches, diagrams for Rtawahist calculations and such. The letters were mostly the standard Akademiya-template. Master of So-and-So writing to To-Whom-it-May-Regard to inform them of acceptance or denial of this-or-that-proposal. They may bear his father’s name and have his signature, but really there wasn’t much going on there. </p><p>There was one, though. One letter. </p><p>Kaveh had been sitting in the front room. The windows were open to the back courtyard. The air was nothing but roses and jasmine, and the green of trees and grass that were freshly pruned back. Al-Haitham had put the spin-crystal player on in his study and his window must have been open because Kaveh could hear it too. Something from Inazuma—woodwinds. He was reading through one of the books Al-Haitham’s ancestral house had passed to him. It wasn’t a Kshahrewar text. (Actually, Kaveh’s not sure if it was officially recognized as a text related to any of the Darshans. He was mostly reading the notes. Two of Al-Haitham’s relatives were arguing back and forth, back and forth, in the margins to the point where their writing was encroaching onto the actual text they were debating. It was <em>hilarious</em>. Peak scholarly humor.) Kaveh had some tea at his side and a bit of pastry from the aunt next door that came as a reward for sitting through four hours of a mixture of lecture and gossip. (<em>Entirely worth it.</em>)</p><p>His mind was, mostly, quiet. Which meant for Kaveh the worries of tomorrow were chewing at his left ear, but the mistakes of yesterday were obediently leaving the right ear alone, and thus Kaveh’s thoughts were free to focus entirely on that day, that moment. Flowers. Woodwinds. Drama. Tea. Pastry. Lovely.</p><p>The spin-crystal player switched to a new recording. The aunt next door started yelling at her nephew, who took the verbal beating like a good sport. A dusk bird chittered and flew off, causing the leaves to murmur in protest against the disruption of their normal susurrus.</p><p>Al-Haitham stood over him and said, “It’s ready for you.”</p><p>“What?” Kaveh said, and then, “Did you know your great-great-aunt or something or other has a vicious streak? I think I remember seeing this particular bit published in academic journals in the official records. It’s inspired turn of phrase. Shame it’s about one of the esoteric and mind-numbingly niche topics to ever exist.”</p><p>“Kaveh.” Al-Haitham’s fingertips touched against the top of the book as he pressed it down. “It’s ready.”</p><p>Kaveh looked up. The small wisps of baby-hairs that framed Al-Haitham’s face were stuck to his skin with sweat. His eyes were the approaching horizons over newly subdued waters. Al-Haitham’s mouth was savage in victory. </p><p>“What?” Kaveh repeated even as Al-Haitham sat next to him, taking the book out of his hands and replacing it with an envelope. Kaveh’s hands have never shaken in his entire life. They did not shake then, although it felt like all blood flow had abandoned them. His hands felt frigid.</p><p>Al-Haitham’s hands retreated and Kaveh felt his own pulse pounding in his ears as he turned the envelope over in his hands.<br/>On one side, it read, <em>AZIZ-E DELAM</em>. It was his father’s writing. Kaveh recognized it from the smaller notes and scraps that had deigned to be relinquished into his care previously. </p><p>They say that the memory of sounds, voices, is one of the hardest to preserve. But all it took was Kaveh looking down at the back of that envelope and his father was calling out for his mother. Kaveh blinked and there was the sound of a door opening, a heavy bag of equipment for stargazing and charting being dropped onto he ground.</p><p>“Azizam!” His father’s voice called out, “My head has returned from the stars, but where is my heart to greet it?”</p><p>Kaveh’s ears began to ring. He opened the envelope. He slid out the paper—it had been folded into a flower on a stem. Al-Haitham must have painstakingly refolded it after restoring it or arguing with it (or whatever he was doing with it), or perhaps the paper was lively enough to do that itself.</p><p>The paper resisted as Kaveh tried to unfold it. But only for a moment. As though sighing, after a sharp tug on the leaf of the paper stem, the letter began to unfurl. Age had softened wrinkles into the paper, valleys of lighter color. The page was so soft under Kaveh’s fingertips it was like holding fabric. The page warmed underneath his freezing fingers.</p><p>His eyes roved over black ink, slightly crooked because Rtawahists can’t write in a straight line to save their life and that’s apparently a stereotype that goes back generations. His eyes raised to the top of the page.</p><p><em>Azizam, Faranak,</em> his father wrote.<em> Do you miss me yet?</em> And that was as far as Kaveh could get. The letters blurred, turning into smudges of black on pale cream.</p><p>But it was not the fault of the letter. It was <em>Kaveh’s</em>. Kaveh’s eyes stung and his ribs creaked. He closed his eyes and turned away, throwing the paper away before he accidentally crushed it in his hands. It felt like his entire body was compressing down, tight against bone, against nerve. His brain felt like it had lit up on fire as his father’s voice came back to him, bright and so full of love that Kaveh was choking on it. Distantly, Kaveh’s hands curled into tight fists and his breathing became painfully fast.</p><p>His father’s voice, right in his ear, called for his mother. It echoed in his head. His voice, her name. Their way of speaking to one another. Left ear, his father. Right ear, his mother. In the middle, Kaveh.</p><p>And Kaveh’s stomach turned with longing, all of that lovely pastry and tea pushed up against his throat.</p><p>Al-Haitham’s hands, warm, immediately covered his. Al-Haitham’s long, steady, fingers pried Kaveh’s hands open, and then swiftly slotted themselves into place to prevent Kaveh’s hands from crushing themselves—permitting Kaveh’s hands to crush his own instead.</p><p>“I just finished repairing that,” Al-Haitham’s voice cut in over Kaveh’s father’s. He sounded utterly disinterested, as though this were something that they do all the time. Just another routine of theirs that’s been freshly brought to Kaveh’s attention. Dinner and dishes, groceries, grounding Kaveh during a mental break over the address of a letter from a man long dead to a woman long gone. Kaveh’s head bowed under the incredible weight of past and present and their dichotomous tones taking their simultaneous swings at him like sledge-hammers.</p><p>Kaveh laughed. “Sorry.” Or maybe he cried, “Sorry.”</p><p>Al-Haitham began to detail out how he spent the past several hours negotiating with that letter. And before that, how he’d painstakingly restored its ink, patched and shored up its weakened edges and the folds where it’d gone bare. Al-Haitham swung into a tangent about paper-prices and ink formulas and changes in formulation that have started happening ever since Inazuma reopened.</p><p>“Did you hear the song I received?” Al-Haitham said, “Ah. I think it’s moved on. It’s into the duets now.”</p><p>Kaveh’s ears picked up, past the sound of his own breathing and the echoes in his head and Al-Haitham’s voice, the woodwinds dancing.</p><p>“Yes,” Kaveh croaked. “I hear it.”</p><p>“And do you hear Nour Aunt, too? She’s been going on for almost an hour,” Al-Haitham said, one hand leaving Kaveh’s. “What is she upset about now and how likely is it that she’s going to come over here about it?”</p><p>“Her nephew,” Kaveh answered, pressing the hand Al-Haitham was still holding to his forehead. Their knuckles pressed against the ridge of his brow, relief against the weary ache that had begun to expand like a balloon from within. Soft fabric was arranged over his shoulders. The quilted blanket. Kaveh breathed, sucked in another lungful of air, and tasted summer. The blanket seemed to curl around him, coaxing him down, to quiet. Voices join the woodwinds—not Nour Aunt or her nephew. Not his father’s or his mother’s, which were going quiet as Kaveh listened to the woodwinds. They were not voices with names or faces that Kaveh could identify. But he knew them anyway. Or at least, he had come to know them.</p><p>The echoes of Al-Haitham’s family sang to him, the weight of the warmth of their memory and their voices hooking into Kaveh’s mind and that expanding ache to lull it all to sleep. So why bother to fight it?</p><p>Kaveh slept.</p><p>When Kaveh woke the letter was folded up again, back in its envelope, waiting. Night had fallen. The lights in the house were all on. The spin-crystal was quiet, but Kaveh could hear the sounds of pots simmering in the kitchen. </p><p>Kaveh sat up, drawing the blanket around his shoulders—he wasn’t yet ready to let it go—and followed his nose to where Al-Haitham was preparing dal. </p><p>“I don’t know what happened,” Kaveh said, throat already closing around the words that recreate the memory to be lived again, “I…”</p><p>“You don’t have to tell me anything,” Al-Haitham said when Kaveh could go no further. So Kaveh did not. </p><p>Since then Al-Haitham has spoken of the progress in restoration, but has brought no further documents to Kaveh nor has he spoken of any progress in the actual debate-negotiations part of his side of the exchange of their favors. It’s fine. Kaveh doesn’t ask, and there’s a surprising plethora of other things to speak of.</p><p>There are talks of mundane things. Groceries. Scheduling with each other and for meetings with the remarkably overlapping circle of friends (Kaveh never thought that would happen, but here they are). Signing for arriving packages. Little trailing bits of gossip picked up here and there, about this and that. </p><p>One of the neighbors down the street has given birth to a lovely baby girl. Kaveh asks Al-Haitham if they should send a gift together. Al-Haitham does not point out that normally Kaveh just goes ahead with the social niceties and adds Al-Haitham to the gift anyway. Instead Al-Haitham nods and asks Kaveh what he’s thinking of giving.</p><p>They are both mutually attempting to tidy up the small plot behind the house but have no idea where to start. There’s some potted plants that neither of them can remember being the one to bring it scattered in with various pieces of junk that they each say is entirely the other’s fault. Kaveh thinks that it would be nice to have vegetables and herbs. Al-Haitham thinks that maybe they should read some books on the subject before jumping into it because what experience do either of them have with actively taking care of a plant? The few plants they do have success with are, apparently, just the sort that are too spiteful to die.</p><p>“That’s an interesting way of talking about a plant,” Kaveh mused, leaning through the window that opens into the front room, poking Al-Haitham’s arm with a sprig of mint.</p><p>“Am I inaccurate?” Al-Haitham replied, waving Kaveh’s hand away but not closing the window as he continued to sort through the numerous books Kaveh had finally gotten Al-Haitham to part with in order to make room for all of the other books the ancestral house was now attempting to drown them both in.</p><p>It is somehow easier to talk to Al-Haitham now. Kaveh doesn’t know why. Al-Haitham and Kaveh have mutually brought each other to their worst, their lowest, it’s not like that’s a new secret part of themselves that was recently revealed or shared. But it’s about family, which is something they never talk about, so perhaps that’s it. It’s such a tender wound. Maybe it’s the warmth of this house touching upon the frayed and barely there threads that they’ve managed to spin to keep them together without falling into the same trap they did years ago. Who knows? Kaveh can’t question it or it’ll disappear. </p><p>Some people would call Kaveh a masochist, but he doesn’t actually take pleasure in living in a house with so much tension. If he had to choose between how he was living in this house before (contained, careful, cautious) and now (ineffable) he would pick now, of course. There’s nothing else to say about that.</p><p>They talk about their jobs, which is not exactly new. But Al-Haitham doesn’t pick and comment about Kaveh’s wage, the ratio of time and effort, or make any other unwelcome comments about what Kaveh does and does not do. Much to Kaveh’s surprise, the man even remembers some of Kaveh’s previous projects and clients and asks if some of his current works are related to those. Well. Kaveh shouldn’t be too surprised. When Al-Haitham speaks of the work of the Grand Scribe Kaveh’s mind is able to recall with fuzzy clarity little fragments of previously given information about the role, about Al-Haitham’s coworkers in the Mahamata. And where, before, Kaveh might say something about the politics, the drudgery of the bureaucratic machine, Kaveh holds his tongue. It is not, he has to admit, Al-Haitham’s fault that the world runs on compromises that leave a terrible aftertaste in the mouth.</p><p>Al-Haitham also has other restorations he’s working on. None are as complex as Kaveh’s father’s items, but some are just as interesting. Once, Kaveh sat with him and watched as he restored a set of bamboo slips that had been sent to him all the way from Liyue. Carefully, line by line, Al-Haitham refreshed the ink and brought the slips back to life.</p><p>But today neither of them are working. Well. Kaveh sort of is. Al-Haitham definitely isn’t.</p><p>Kaveh is sitting on the floor of the main room, his drawing board propped up against the coffee table and his thighs as he sketches. Light streams in from the open windows. Al-Haitham has put out the bakhoor. It’s windy today so the smell of it is diffused through the house, just enough to lull them both into contented quiet but not enough to drop them both off to sleep. The light from the window catches on a small glass lotus sitting on one of the shelves, spitting little speckles of rainbows across the room at intervals. It was Kaveh’s mother’s. He found it in the box of her belongings wrapped up in paper and thought it too much of a shame to be left there or in his room.</p><p>It has been a long time since Kaveh sketched just to sketch. He’s pinned one of his father’s landscape photographs to the edge of his board and he’s sketching out little doodles of impossible buildings that might fit into the photograph.</p><p>Al-Haitham is behind him, sprawled out on the divan with the quilted blanket tossed over his stomach, book in hand. It’s not one of his family’s books or any of the numerous books he’s liberated from the House of Daena. It’s a novel fresh off the presses in Inazuma and according to Al-Haitham Kaveh would hate it because the plot is so thin that it can barely move itself along and the protagonists have about as much awareness as a frog in the bottom of a well.</p><p>(“Then why are you reading it?” Kaveh asked, appalled when he took the book from Al-Haitham’s hands and did a quick flip through, verifying that—yes. He did, in fact, not like this at all. It amazes him what manages to get into print and circulation.</p><p>“Excess consumption of fried food is unhealthy, and yet we as a species create entire cultural cornerstones over it,” Al-Haitham replied. </p><p>“It’s literary junk food is what you’re saying.”</p><p>Al-Haitham nodded as he took the book back, settling in to read, “It’s literary junk food.”)</p><p>Now it’s just the skritch-scratch of Kaveh’s pencil and the intermittent sounds of a page turning, or Al-Haitham flipping several at a time to check where his next chapter break is.</p><p>There’s no need to fill this silence, but Kaveh finds himself wanting to anyway.</p><p>“Al-Haitham,” Kaveh asks as he outlines a house in the shape of a cake, “Your work in restoration isn’t technically part of scribe training, is it?” </p><p>“No,” Al-Haitham confirms. “It’s a required skill, but beyond the basics there’s no requirements for scribes to pursue further advancement in the craft. It becomes its own specialization.”</p><p>“You chose it.”</p><p>“Yes.” Al-Haitham turns a page, the sound of it somehow managing to convey the feeling of dry amusement. “You’ll be asking me why.”</p><p>“I always thought you’d go in for full theoretical research,” Kaveh admits. “I mean. You joining up with the Mahamata isn’t exactly a surprise, but you moving into a practical application field involves a lot more…teamwork than I imagined you’d be willing to deal with.”</p><p>“The issue of working with others is only an issue if the people you work with aren’t as capable as you.” Al-Haitham says this carefully. They both know that they are dangerously close towards igniting something that shouldn’t ever see the light of day again. “And as you’ve seen, most of the time, the most frustrating part is the materials themselves.”</p><p>“I would think that they would be the part that attracts you to the craft.” Kaveh doodles a cantankerous looking cat next to the sketch outline of the house. “What even gave you the idea?” </p><p>Most people in Sumeru, prior to the de-activation of the Akasha, only ever owned one or two physical books outside of any required school texts. The handling and restoration and negotiation with books is not exactly one most people would ever think of. Even among scholars the use of physical texts was something of a quirk. Most researchers who used physical books were Haravatat, otherwise it was because they were mandated to by whatever course they were in. There are several researchers and scholars who, even now, complain about using physical books. It takes too long to find what you want, sometimes the information is outdated and you have to find a new edition, when a text is referenced you have to go find that one too instead of just having a handy little Akasha note, so on and so forth. Kaveh’s never particularly minded the manual nature of it, but it’s a point of grief and debate among scholars everywhere.</p><p>“I would think you would get frustrated with it,” Kaveh continues before Al-Haitham can answer. “The lack of clarity. The lack of verification. The whole mess it can become—opinion and revision altering fact into a narrative, turning everything supposedly certain into a question of endless debate. The room for misinterpretation and misrepresentation changing the indisputable into something that must be looked over again and again from ground up. The whole inherent bias that’s woven into it, often without ever being addressed or even realized as extant.”</p><p>At least with the Akasha those documents are reviewed and there’s as log for modifications. Things that entered the Akasha had strict controls to ensure veracity and lack of bias. Any forms of bias or questionable information were heavily tagged and annotated. When it comes to physical books it isn’t that hard to get something out there. All you need is the paper and a writing implement. And for the reader—well. Reading comprehension and common sense aren’t exactly as standard as one would hope.</p><p>“Is that not what makes them fascinating to begin with?” Al-Haitham replies. “Is this not how you keep yourself sharp? Through discernment and thorough testing of your own perceptions? The only answers worth having are the ones you get for yourself. It stays with you if you work for it, make it yours. You know this more than most. Besides. If someone just gives you the straight answer doesn’t it get boring?”</p><p>Kaveh tips his head to the side as he shades in patterns on the sketch-house’s window. “As if I would know when it comes to you.”</p><p>Al-Haitham exhales a laugh. </p><p>“It’s not that I disagree with you, but we both know we’re in the minority on this topic. And it’s so rare that we’re in agreement over a matter of opinion and preference,” Kaveh says.</p><p>“We both know it isn’t a simple matter of preference—comfort and convenience. The question of physical documents, that should not be a question, involves addressing things of a much deeper issue. A deeper issue of comprehension and cognizance. Both topics being unsurprisingly volatile in a nation of scholars. Learning how to read a basic text without the Akasha providing helpful notes that strip it down to its basic summary did not help anyone learn to pick up nuance or how to put together what is not said, or even basic consideration for how to evaluate tone. You can tell someone a simple statement as if it were fact but whether or not they truly understood it or are capable of coming up with the logic that created that statement on their own is questionable,” Al-Haitham says. “Without the Akasha, we’re all realizing Sumeru is sorely lacking in independent ability to research, verify, conclude. The Akasha created too much dependence.”</p><p>“Agreed.”</p><p>“Issues of basic comprehension aside, I would think you would understand the appeal of printed text,” Al-Haitham says. “After all—a physical documents can give anyone a voice to say anything. And the audience can come in with their own interpretations as they please, walking away with what they want and what they need, or something new entirely which may or may not be in line with the original creator’s intent. Free spirited, isn’t it?”</p><p>Kaveh laughs, turning to look back at Al-Haitham. Al-Haitham is already looking back at him, book resting open on his chest, entire body relaxed.</p><p>“The way you describe things amazes me,” Kaveh tells him. “Plants as spiteful. Books as free spirited.”</p><p>“I’m not wrong though, am I?”</p><p>“No. I suppose not. But I do wonder where that particular sort of creativity of yours comes from.”</p><p>“Perhaps it’s genetic,” Al-Haitham shrugs. </p><p>“Along with the love for physical books?”</p><p>Al-Haitham nods. “Most of the books in my family’s house are old enough to have character of their own,” Al-Haitham says. “And even the ones that didn’t, as you can tell, were liberally annotated to the point that they were essentially rewritten. I grew up with books that spoke in their own ways. Those books are a physical record for how people think and change together over time, and how these thoughts and changes impact others and can alter entire world views. You can trace the shifts in thought between one generation to the next in ways that you’ll never see in any formal paper or text. A slice of the thoughts of time preserved in a startlingly fragile medium that somehow manages to endure despite ridicule and physical challenge over time—liable to whims of fate in how it survives. A puzzle of the interlocking components of physical medium, linguistic change, cultural adjustment, and simple surrounding context.”</p><p>“You could just say you like the challenge.”</p><p>“I like the challenge. And you?”</p><p>“Would I be here if I didn’t? If you’re asking where I come by my own stance of appreciation for physical text that’s entirely honestly earned the hard way. My parents had scholars in their family, but it wasn’t a whole lineage like yours. We had books, but not in the number or quality yours did. Most of them were basic textbooks. Nothing exciting there.” Kaveh shakes his head. “My family is much more mundane, I’m afraid. No family treasure like yours.”</p><p>“I would argue otherwise.”</p><p>“That’s because you’re a contrarian.”</p><p>“Was your mother the only Kshahrewar?”</p><p>“I believe so.” Kaveh reaches up and thumbs at his father’s photograph. “I learned it all at her knee before I ever knew what it all meant. The math, the principles of design, the combinations of colors, materials…all the questions to ask and how to ask them, all the things to look out for. I suppose it was like you and your natural handling of books.”</p><p>Kaveh pauses, setting his pencil down as he looks at the page full of impossible creations that are still quite lovely to look at.</p><p>“I think I started all of this because it was what I learned, what I knew. The world was architecture. Don’t say anything <em>literal</em>.” Kaveh picks up the pencil and tosses it in the direction of Al-Haitham’s face. “It’s like you and your family’s books. Anyway. I suppose that’s where it started but overtime it grew into its own thing within me. Part of me in a new way intrinsic to my own self.” Kaveh leans on his palms, eyes closing as he remembers those drawings he would make as a child. He remembers his mother’s drawings and how he would watch her at her drafting table, how she would make the numbers create the most beautiful of things. Amazing things. And as lovely as it was to watch her, as amazed as he was to see her set her jaw and drag miracles of math out of the page…</p><p>“I wanted it for myself,” Kaveh admits quietly. “I wanted to be part of something larger than myself. I wanted some part of me to always exist somewhere in this world, undeniable and unquestionable. Something to say—I was here. I am here. Perhaps the buildings may fall, or perhaps they’ll be changed entirely overtime. But it’s unquestionable that it would last far longer than I ever will. And through this fragment of me that’s been dispersed through wood and stone and clay, some permutation of me would live on long after me, to be borrowed and changed and live on in all the ways that matters. Living when I am no longer able to. Dying and living, growing and adapting. Interacting with the world long after I’ve left it.” </p><p>Kaveh turns to look at Al-Haitham, wry twist to his lips. “Will you laugh? It’s such a grandiose thought, isn’t it? Self-centered, even.”</p><p>“It’s a very you answer,” Al-Haitham says. His eyes are smiling although he keeps a level face and tone. </p><p>“Oh? What makes it a very me answer?”</p><p>To this Al-Haitham just shrugs, picking his book up again. “That it came from you.”</p><p>-</p><p>Al-Haitham’s ancestral home and its immediate surrounding grounds, from the places that Kaveh has been able to see and address to his limited ability, is entirely livable. The darkness, the coolness, that has haunted it has been pushed back and held back. Light reaches deep into the house, and warmth suffuses the floorboards and the window shutters. Dust and neglect have lifted themselves in layers to create the illusion of a waiting place; not abandoned or left behind or locked up, but simply waiting for the return of its occupant after they departed for a brief jaunt to town or around the property. </p><p>That is, <em>if</em> the house would let anyone other than Kaveh in. Kaveh is entirely sure that if Al-Haitham were allowed to return the house would fully open itself. Every room, every field, every door, would slot into place for his pleasure. And any remaining lingering darkness and coldness would be quickly worked through under his hands.</p><p>This is no longer a house on the threshold of death. But it is still a house that needs an occupant. The threat of that darkness returning will remain until it opens in its entirety. Staying locked away and isolated just gives the darkness time to build again.</p><p>“You’re stalling now,” Kaveh says to the house as he rearranges canisters of spices in the kitchen cabinet. It’s been asking for things like that now. Spices. Sugar. Salt. Tea. Coffee. Four. It hasn’t gotten around to asking for meat or items that will spoil quickly, but he thinks it’s going to start in on that soon. Kaveh’s mostly gone along with these requests because dry goods last longer. And Al-Haitham might be paying Kaveh for the things the house asks for, but Kaveh’s not going to be throwing away money on food that’s going to go uneaten and rotten within a few days.</p><p>The house has also been asking Kaveh for new coats of paint, for new wallpaper—new finishing, even. Kaveh went along with that, too, at first. But after the third time he’s been asked to strip the finishing on an entire dining room set meant for sixteen and redo it entirely even his patience starts to run thin.</p><p>“It’s <em>fine</em>,” Kaveh said, putting his foot down on the topic when he house tried to get him to rearrange an entire room with new carpets, curtains, furniture, and wallpaper just so it could see what it might look like. “He doesn’t remember the details. I told you this. You know it. You could look like anything and he would be pleased with it because it’s <em>you</em>. And if he didn’t like it then he’d <em>tell</em> you and then you two could figure it out together. You’re stalling. It’s never going to be perfect because there’s no standard of what your perfect should be. Are you letting him in or not?”</p><p>The answer is <em>not</em>. But now the house wants to know more about the current house Al-Haitham is living in, which brings Kaveh to trying to figure out what he can take from the house in Sumeru City to the house in the countryside without anyone here missing it too badly.</p><p>“Take your teeth cup,” Al-Haitham said when Kaveh brought the topic up to him, with absolutely no hesitation. His eyes immediately went to the cabinet where the clay cup with the rim sculpted to look like it was made of teeth was sitting behind the wooden door.</p><p>Kaveh pinched the bridge of his nose, breathing out through his teeth. “What good will it do to bring your house <em>my</em> things? And I’m using that cup.”</p><p>“It’s an example of what I find distasteful,” Al-Haitham answered. And then, much more helpfully, Al-Haitham said, “Take some of the books from the front room.”</p><p>“Aren’t you using them?”</p><p>“If I need them I’ll make you bring them back. You can bring some of the bedsheets or towels. It’s not like we have an abundance of furniture to be passing between houses.”</p><p>This was a fair point, so Kaveh ended up taking some of the fiction novels Al-Haitham had gone through, the ones with the cracked spines and circled passages and Al-Haitham’s incredibly dry but amusing commentary in the margins, and some of the old linens. The ancestral house accepted both greedily, the books disappearing almost as soon as Kaveh put them down to be neatly sorted into the rest of the house’s daunting catalog. The linens were similarly snatched up, too, but the house seemed a little more unsure on where to put those.</p><p>Kaveh’s brought a few older sets of dish-ware and some older cups, too. These have taken places of pride alongside the older pieces in the cabinets, right up front as though waiting for use. Among a few other things he and Al-Haitham agreed to give to the ancestral house are some older blankets and rugs which they were still using. But they can’t give it new things, and it wouldn’t help to give it things they were going to throw away or turn to scraps. These pieces, just as the older items Kaveh had been bringing to the house in the city, slowly get integrated in along with the antique furniture, the books older than Kaveh, and the generations upon generations worth of accumulated memory. </p><p>For all that the house has begun to ask for things that might imply it would open itself up, it has not actually asked for things needed for Al-Haitham to move back in. Nor will it accept them voluntarily given. Perishables and fresh linens aside, it does not want Al-Haitham’s clothes. It does not want items Al-Haitham uses often.</p><p>Al-Haitham had given Kaveh a half-full bottle of oil, lightly scented of jasmine, and the small tin of joint-soothing balm he uses on his hands. Kaveh set both those items along with a bit of Al-Haitham’s kohl and a new toothbrush down on a table in the front room. When Kaveh returned a few days later they were untouched. And when Kaveh returned a few days after that the house, for extra effect, had put an unnatural layer of dust on all of them.</p><p>“I don’t understand you,” Kaveh said as he took the items back, the dust falling off as soon as he touched them to take them away. The house had no response to that, other than to gently usher him out the door before he tried to put anything down again.</p><p>Kaveh’s getting ready to call it quits here. The house is fully livable. It just…doesn’t want to be lived in, which is the entire antithesis of what a house is and if it keeps up like that all the progress Kaveh managed to make will be undone within a few months, if not years. </p><p>He doesn’t know how to tell Al-Haitham this, though. Kaveh’s been writing to some experts abroad but no one’s ever heard of a case like this one and they’d need to see the house in person. Obviously that isn’t going to happen so all of their suggestions are based purely on theory that doesn’t live up to the facts.</p><p>There is a house that loves its owner, but also refuses to be seen or occupied by said owner.</p><p>Kaveh is reading through the latest correspondence he’s gotten from a colleague of a colleague of a colleague, some sort of incredibly well known consultant in Liyue who’s specialty isn’t exactly houses but is very well versed in seemingly every manner of topic anyway. Kaveh’s trying to make heads and tails of the man’s writing—he must be <em>ancient</em>, he writes like some of the really, really, <em>really</em> old Masters that Kaveh’s met—when Al-Haitham calls out to him. Kaveh is in the front room, standing next to the table where they sort out their messages. Kaveh had seen the letter and ripped into it immediately.</p><p>Kaveh turns away from said letter (Maybe he should have Al-Haitham read it.) to where Al-Haitham rounds the corner. Kaveh’s mind goes quiet, the request on his tongue going out with nary a whisper as Al-Haitham comes into view.</p><p>He’s holding the box of Kaveh’s father’s things. Al-Haitham’s face is solemn. </p><p>“It’s done,” Al-Haitham says to the absolute silence that seems to have descended upon the room. Kaveh sets the letter in his hands down, rubbing his palms on the sides of his thighs as he feels himself start to grow cold. </p><p>“Define done?”</p><p>“I have,” Al-Haitham says, walking towards him with the box, “restored every single document in this box, from photograph to receipt, to the best of my ability. Every single book, letter, and paper that’s been so much as accidentally folded from being packed in here, opens. Everything has agreed to be seen and deciphered and understood. There is nothing left for me to do to them.”</p><p>Kaveh’s eyes don’t move from Al-Haitham’s face once. He can’t look down.</p><p>Al-Haitham presumably reaches into the box to touch something, “I would suggest you start with this one. It was the most recent of all of them. It was updated right until the end.”</p><p>“You read them?”</p><p>“No. I was only allowed to see the dates so I could arrange things chronologically,” Al-Haitham explains. “I do not know the contents of what was written. The rest of it is up to you.”</p><p>“Me?”</p><p>“I convinced them to open. I made it so that their physical forms should be able to withstand any…emotional handling. They seem willing enough to be read, or at least be convinced to be read. You just need to read them.”</p><p>Kaveh forces himself to look. He reaches into the box and takes up the leather-bound and unmarked journal on top.</p><p>“Kaveh,” Al-Haitham sounds unusually hesitant. When Kaveh looks up there’s a furrow between Al-Haitham’s brows, a slight pinch to his mouth. Al-Haitham reaches out and covers the top of the journal with his hand.</p><p>“Do you want me to read it or not?” Kaveh asks, but Al-Haitham’s hand is hot. Hot enough to mean that Kaveh must be freezing. Kaveh swallows, mouth feeling dry. Unease pounds at the backs of his shoulders and kicks his calves.</p><p>“You’re pale,” Al-Haitham says. “Do you want to sit down?” And then, Al-Haitham’s hand hesitates before drawing away. “Do want to be alone?”</p><p>“No,” Kaveh blurts out, too loud, too sharp. “I—there’s no need. It’s just—they’re just books. Papers. It’s nothing so dramatic. I’m just going to look through them quickly to make sure it’s all…good and I’ll write my mother to see how she wants me to send them to her. It’s not that big a deal, don’t look at me like that.”</p><p>“The last time—“</p><p>“I was unprepared,” Kaveh interrupts, pulling his hands out from Al-Haitham’s reach as he holds the book in his palms. “Which is ridiculous because this has been over twenty years coming. If anything I’m overdue.”</p><p>Before either of them can say anything more, Kaveh forces his eyes down to the book in his hands and he opens it. As Al-Haitham said, the book opens—although a little stiffly. The pages are clean, but soft with age. As soon as it opens Kaveh breathes in the faintly ticklish smell of old paper. The ink is crisp and clear. Every single character perfectly out of line in the crooked way that all of the other hand-written documents Kaveh managed to see thus far are. </p><p><em>Rtawahists are so occupied with their eyes pointed to the sky that they can’t possibly see the straight line they’re supposed to write on,</em> Kaveh is about to joke.</p><p>But as Kaveh stares down at the first page he realizes he <em>can’t</em> read it. The characters, on their own, he can understand as he glances down the page. Nothing’s moving. The ink isn’t trying to flow away or being absorbed back into its pages. Nor is it trying to blot itself. The characters aren’t rearranging themselves or doing an acrobatics about the confines of the paper.</p><p>Each character is perfectly still. As Kaveh flips through, he realizes every page is like this. Every single page is just…lines of ink. Kaveh would say that maybe his father wrote in code, except this doesn’t look like a code to him.</p><p>“I can’t read it,” Kaveh says, voice sounding—even to his ears—dangerous. </p><p>Kaveh holds the book out between them, flat in his palm as he turns page by page.</p><p>“The ink doesn’t form words.” Kaveh closes his eyes, breathing out slowly. “Is there any chance that the books gave you a hint about my father possibly writing in code?”</p><p>“No.” And then Al-Haitham says, not softly, but also not-not-sharply, “Your father didn’t write his personal effects in a secret code.”</p><p>“Why wouldn’t he? You do.”</p><p>Al-Haitham, of course, says the worst possible thing to that. </p><p>“I do. But my code is not a secret. It is a shared one.” <em>And you,</em> Al-Haitham doesn’t say, <em>have the key to the code. You helped to create it after all.</em></p><p>Kaveh closes the book and places it back on top of the rest.</p><p>“Kaveh, I told you from the beginning. I can convince the books to be read. I did. They opened. They’re ready. But it does not matter if you aren’t ready for them. It’s up to you, at this point, to convince yourself to actually read what I’ve unlocked.”</p><p>“I don’t know what that means,” Kaveh shakes his head. “How can I not be ready? Twenty years, Al-Haitham.<em> Twenty years without answers.</em> You know how long I’ve been waiting. You, of all people, know how—how this has ruined me. Haunted me. You’ve always known how it’s made me rotten. And you’re telling me I’m not ready?”</p><p>“I’m not telling you anything, Kaveh.”</p><p>“It <em>sounds</em> like you are.”</p><p>Al-Haitham’s lips press together against whatever retort he was about to let fly as he visibly reigns himself in. And he asks, “<em>Are</em> you ready?”</p><p>“I’m saying I am!” Kaveh gestures to the box. “So what is this? How can these—<em>these things</em> judge me as inadequate? What do they know of me? Over half my life spent wondering. It’s my father. It’s my mother. It’s the home I left behind. It’s <em>everything</em>. God, <em>of course</em> I’m ready for it. I’ve been practically dying over it for most of my life.” As Kaveh speaks he starts to pace, catching Al-Haitham’s eyes narrowing before he looks away to focus on anything else. The floor. The stack of letters. The patterns of light and shadow formed by the stained glass windows on the floor. The little glass lotus on the shelf and its rainbows. “What the hell do I have to <em>do</em> to be ready? Didn’t I make it this far already? What other bar is there for me to clear?”</p><p>“And what is it, exactly, that you are ready for?”</p><p>“<em>For it to be over, Al-Haitham!</em>” Kaveh throws his hands up into the air. “What the hell else? What <em>else</em> would I be waiting for this entire time? I want it to be over. I want it over and done with. I want this chapter closed and put away, this door finally locked, and the slate cleared!”</p><p>“No,” Al-Haitham says, sharp. “You aren’t.”</p><p>Kaveh turns to glare at him briefly, “Now who’s not telling me anything? What would you know of it? What does anyone know of it, let alone some pieces of paper and leather that were shut up in the wrong department for several years? I feel scammed here.”</p><p>“You know.”</p><p>“I’m saying—“</p><p>“No. You’re not saying. You’re <em>lying</em>. To me, to yourself, to your father’s effects. You <em>know</em> that you’re not ready.” Al-Haitham moves to block Kaveh’s pacing, and when that doesn’t work, stubbornly follows after Kaveh around the room. “This is not a matter of restoration. This is not a flaw in the work that I’v done. I’ve cleaned them, enforced them, enhanced them so prevent them from future damages and falling into worse habits. I’ve added new securities to protect them from being lost again. I have done my due diligence as I would with any other document that’s come into my care. The matter of the contents is entirely on you. And if you can’t see the contents then it’s clearly you; not me, not the text.” And then Al-Haitham says, hurling the words at Kaveh’s back, “You don’t want to <em>know</em> what was written in these. You just want to do your due diligence to say that you did, then get them out of your sight. You want to have the closure of knowing that they were in your hands and they exist without actually going through them, interacting with them and what they might reveal to you.” </p><p>“<em>Yes</em>!” Kaveh snaps, turning sharply on his heel and nearly colliding into Al-Haitham and the box in the process. “Fine. You’re right. When I say I’m ready what I mean is<em> I’m ready for it to be done with.</em> I’m ready to move out of this phase of my life. And I want to do it as <em>fast</em> as possible. It’s enough for me to know that his belongings are returned to my mother and are in good condition so that they can be kept with her for as long as she wants them close. You’re right, I don’t actually want to <em>read</em> the contents. For me it’s enough that they’re back with <em>her</em> and that <em>she</em> can go through them and get whatever closure and relief she can from them. And for me—I don’t <em>want</em> to know. I don’t want to go through all of it. I just want it to be over. Is that so much?”</p><p>“Yes,” Al-Haitham answers instantly, eyes bright, jaw set. The ox with the red flag waived. “Yes. It’s selfish of you. You want it to be over for <em>you</em>.”</p><p>“That’s what I’m—“</p><p>“No. <em>No</em>. You want it to be over just for <em>you</em>. You don’t want to address it. You want it gone. You want to foist it off onto someone else to deal with. That way <em>you</em> don’t have to talk about it, looks at it, hear it, or even think about it; so <em>you</em> can continue to pretend like you aren’t a casually gutted and bleeding out and still rotting alive over it. So <em>you</em> can pretend like you’re fine as always even when we both know that you aren’t. Just like always you’re going to turn and run away from the problem that you’ve carried with you like you can outrun it if you just keep throwing yourself into other things fast enough. Like all of the other fires you put out for other people is going to make up for the one that’s hollowed you out.”</p><p>Kaveh’s hands squeeze into fists. “Al-Haitham. Watch yourself.”</p><p>Al-Haitham’s chin sharply tips upward, eyes narrowing. Kaveh’s blunt and bitten nails dig into his palms. He feels like he can taste his pulse. Anger and hurt attempt to shout out cooler reason. Kaveh pulls at the edges of his temper with everything he has. His voice is as steady as his hands when he says, “I don’t want to fight with you over my father’s books of all things.”</p><p>“Nor,” Al-Haitham says slowly, voice low with anger and just as careful in control, “do I.”</p><p>Kaveh breathes out and forces his hands out of fists. They are not the boys who tore themselves apart. They are not the men who flung barely civil arguments at each other through public journals and critiques, and carried on when that wasn’t enough on public message boards. They are not the same men who signed the landlord-renter contract agreement a few years ago. They are not even the same men who went into this little exchange several months ago.</p><p>“Then <em>why</em>,” Kaveh asks holding onto his reason and his tone and his urge to turn around and walk away from all of this through the memory of Al-Haitham’s faint smile, the smell of bakhoor, the taste of dal, and the imprint of a silver key entrusted into his care, “are we? Is this some sort of twisted payback for me not making progress on your house? You can’t say I’m not ready.”</p><p>“It is not <em>me</em> who is saying it, declaring it, deciding it,” Al-Haitham says, eyes closing in frustration. “We’re talking in circles—it’s <em>you</em>, Kaveh. It’s you. The results speak for themselves. What else could it be? You think you’re the first who’s been in this specific situation? I can tell, Kaveh. The problem isn’t the books. It isn’t the work I did on them.”</p><p>“<em>I’m</em> the problem.” Kaveh repeats flatly. </p><p>Then the words slip out, despite the memory of Al-Haitham’s hands covering his own as Kaveh’s father’s voice called out to his mother in the back of his head. Despite the memory of the two of them standing side by side eating pitaya in the kitchen. Despite the memory of the two of them standing on opposite sides of the jasmine threshold, Al-Haitham reaching out to give Kaveh planks of wood, jars of paint, and containers of nails one by one.</p><p>“What would <em>you</em> know of me, Al-Haitham? Of the loss? What would <em>you</em> know of the situation,<em> the problem</em>, as you call it? You can’t say I’m not ready. You can’t say that because you know nothing of my loss. My grief. How could you? To grieve you’d have to love something first. And what in your life was there to love when they were already lost to you as foregone conclusions?”</p><p>The words come from the worst place in Kaveh’s heart, full of all that poison and all of that hate and all of that sorrow and guilt and grief mixed all together into the foulest, indigestible, intolerable filth that makes up a heart. They’re not even true. Even as Kaveh speaks them, the words scalding on the tongue, he knows they’re not true. But it comes from the same place that once forced Kaveh to say:<em> I regret ever knowing you. I regret you.</em></p><p>In answer to that question from ages ago—<em>this</em> is what grief does to you.</p><p>How much of their anger comes from grief? How much of themselves had they ruined because of that never-ending spring of it?</p><p>
<em>All of it.</em>
</p><p>Al-Haitham’s face has drained of blood, of color, and seemingly of life. The only thing left alive is the eyes: blazing. Ah. Kaveh knows this face. He’s only seen it once before. For the longest time, Kaveh thought that this would be the last face he would ever see Al-Haitham make. This is the face that haunts Kaveh like an unpleasant aftertaste every time he sees Al-Haitham smile.</p><p>“Master Architect of the Kshahrewar, you came to me for my expertise as Grand Scribe of the Akademiya and Master Restorer of the Haravatat. I’m giving it to you now. Just because you don’t like what you hear doesn’t mean you can insult my ability. Aren’t you supposed to be a professional?” The words would be infuriating, challenging, aggravating. But Al-Haitham’s tone is freezing. Al-Haitham moves forward in sharp, fast movements as he shoves the box into Kaveh’s arms. “Do what you want. I already told you the diagnosis. You know your cure.” He lets go and Kaveh has to hold on or they’ll fall. And then, very quietly, Al-Haitham continues as he’s walking past Kaveh, “I should have known better when it comes to <em>you</em> by now.”</p><p>-</p><p>After that fight they return to how it was before. Before the exchange of key and books. Before the dinner with TIghnnari, Cyno, Collei, the Traveler, and Paimon. Before the house, here in Sumeru City, began to rouse itself to the both of them and try to follow along with the beat of their hearts. Before the Inter-Darshan competition and the sorrowful truths it began to bring to light. Before the whole overthrowing of the Sages and the great reformation of the Akademiya.</p><p>Perhaps this is what it would have been like if Al-Haitham and Kaveh were still forced to be physically present near each other after their dissolution of their thesis. The earth salted and razed. The vegetation stripped bare. The houses emptied. The waters drained. Just decimation and abandonment left behind.</p><p>Kaveh shoves the box of his father’s belongings where his mother’s empty one used to be. He returns to staying mostly in his room if he had to be in the house, and staying away from it as much as possible otherwise. They return to speaking to each other through the slate in brief fragments of sentences. All meals are taken separately.</p><p>The key to Al-Haitham’s ancestral house had been in Kaveh’s pocket when they fought. Al-Haitham has not asked for it back because it would require that they talk to each other. Kaveh would put it somewhere Al-Haitham would see it, but he feels uneasy just leaving the key lying about.</p><p>In any case, there’s one last thing he ought to do before he returns the key. Al-Haitham was right. They sought out each other’s help as professionals, and they should abide by that standard at least even if they can’t even be civil with each other.</p><p>(Although Kaveh would also admit this time this sundering of themselves and the thousands of steps back it’s cost them both is his fault entirely. It does something to him. The grief. The thought. The memory. It—it just sits in him and tangles up. It makes him say and do things that just add onto the gross pile afterwards. It’s a vicious cycle that keeps Kaveh awake and eats at him. Al-Haitham was right. It guts him. Hollows him. But what else is supposed to do but try to get rid of it? However he can? Avoid it or get rid of it. That’s the only thing to do, isn’t there?)</p><p>Kaveh takes that silver key which feels like a leaden weight in his pocket, then his palm, and walks into the house.</p><p>The house brightens to him, eager for its latest update. The light seems to form a path, trying to direct him to where the house wants him today. But Kaveh stays in the entryway, ready to walk back out as soon as he’s finished. Because he is. Finished.</p><p>“I’m not coming back,” Kaveh tells the house. He holds up this key. “After today, I am giving this key back to Al-Haitham, your owner. And then it’s up to you and him and whoever else he attempts to consult about you, what happens. I’ve done everything I can for you. And—“</p><p>Kaveh closes his eyes. </p><p>“And I do not have the <em>right</em> to stand here,” he says. The house, around him, goes silent, confused. Shadows of leaves and branches shiver through the windows in question.</p><p>“We fought,” Kaveh says. “It was my fault. I was at fault. I went too far. I said cruel and untrue things to him. About him. I insulted both his professional attitude and his character.”</p><p>The house, around him, as it did that first time he was here, darkened. Cools. Freezes. It flexes, all of that darkness returning. Kaveh stands waiting judgement. But it does not come. The darkness recedes. The warmth returns. The whispering and shuffling of branch and leaf on the wall returns, still confused. The river of light returns and the house goes back to trying to nudge him forward. </p><p>“No. I’m not—look. I shouldn’t be here as it is. I just came here to tell you—“ Kaveh takes in a breath. </p><p>He looks around. He can spot a few of the books he’s brought back from the city on the shelves here. The rug he’d brought over the last time has sprawled out like a lazy cat in front of a bookshelf on the far side of the room. Each window shines clear, the light filling the room and pushing all the shadows to the very fine edges of the room. As always, only this room and the kitchen are visible to him. But what he can see opens up to him warmly. </p><p>“There’s no point in this,” Kaveh says to the house. The shadow of leaves and branches on the wall go still. Kaveh gestures outwards. “All of this—the cleaning, the repairing, the rearranging, all of it. There’s no point to it and you know it. If Al-Haitham doesn’t see it, it doesn’t matter. You have to let him in for it to mean something. You can’t keep putting it off. Or will you keep denying forever? Do you actually want him to never come back? Because he’s not a child anymore. One day, he too—like all of those other people buried in your lands—, will be gone. And that will be the end of it. You’ll never see him again. He’ll die without ever have come home to you. Are you going to refuse to let him be buried here, too?”</p><p>The house starts to go cold again. To tremble.</p><p>“You’re lucky,” Kaveh presses forward, undaunted. Because he owes Al-Haitham this. He was terrible and it was unwarranted and unfair of him. Al-Haitham’s been terrible to him and they’ve hurt each other in dozens of ways. It’s never justified and it’s never right, but sometimes it might have been provoked. This time it wasn’t that. And—when Kaveh looks at the facts of it, Al-Haitham’s been good to Kaveh more than he’s been terrible. The fact that Kaveh somehow hasn’t been evicted is proof enough of that. That he was even let into that house to start with, too. “You’re lucky. He’s still here. He wants to see you. Some of us—some of us don’t get that. Some of us don’t get any of it. Some of us wait for years, wondering and questioning, with no way of getting our answers. And then when we finally do our answers are all…And we just. We never know. There’s no peace. No end to it. And you get to the point where you just want it over with, and you start to get your closure with he fact you’re <em>never</em> going to get it. Of course, that’s when the answers finally decide to roll on in, throwing open all of the doors you thought you’d closed to bring in all of their chaos and messing everything up again, just when you thought you were finally over it—“</p><p>Kaveh feels his temper rising. The ugly wave of it. The hurt. The grief. The poison and the fire that he’s been throwing into everything else he’s ever done to push himself forward and forward. Because if Kaveh stays still for too long it catches up to him. If Kaveh gets too complacent it rises up and snatches away everything good by reminding him of everything terrible and how it’s part of him.</p><p>And no matter what Kaveh’s tried to do, it stays with him. Even when he thought—even when he finally got those answers in the Inter-Darshan competition, after what Al-Haitham found out and the confession of that stupid diadem, and the investigations done by the Matra afterwards—alright, that’s it. Period; end of sentence; case closed. Onwards.</p><p>Even when he thought that, suddenly those damned books showed up. Those damned photographs. And the letters and the sketches. Suddenly they come crashing in on all of Kaveh’s resolve and send him spiraling back into the wondering. The hoping. The dread. The longing.</p><p>That horrible, horrible <em>longing</em> for something that’s already gone and he’s never getting it back, ever, and even if he did it wouldn’t be the same. It would never be the same. And it was ruined partially by his own hands, and even if it wasn’t—</p><p>His father is dead. And all he has left is his father’s books refuse to be read by Kaveh specifically, so what good are they anyway? What could they possibly do for him?</p><p>Kaveh presses his face into his hands, fingers digging into his hair.</p><p>“I would burn it all,” Kaveh confesses into his palms, into the darkness of his own eyelids. “I would burn it all to ash if it meant I could see my father one more time. I don’t want his damn books. I don’t want his letters to my mother and to strangers. I want my father back. But he’s nowhere. He’s gone. And I’ve spent more than half of my life wanting something I can’t have and I think I’m going to spend the rest of my life with that grief, too. And sometimes it terrifies me because whenever I think I’ve moved beyond it and become more than this it just comes back like it never left. Like this is all I ever was.”</p><p>“You can have him—Al-Haitham,” Kaveh says, forcing himself back on track as he fights against the roughness of his voice and the sting of his eyes and the bitter envy chewing at his heart. “You can see him. You can hold him. And you’re choosing not to. Don’t you understand the chance you’ve been given?”</p><p>Kaveh feels it, the house. Watching him as it always does. But there’s a sort of patient quality to it that brushes up against memories that don’t truly solidify when he reaches for them. The memory of something long gone, he supposes. The house feels like it waits, it sits and waits with him, for something else. Something more.</p><p>But there’s nothing more.</p><p>“You should be together,” Kaveh says, feeling incredibly tired and like he’s just gone through a dozen fights against a barrage of hydro mimics in quick succession. “Whatever it is that still bothers you—who else is going to understand you better than Al-Haitham? Whatever it was that caused you to shut yourself up and retreat, he was there for it too, wasn’t he? He was there for all of it? If you just work through it with him, whatever it is, it would help. Sometimes just being with someone who knows what you’re going through—“</p><p>Kaveh’s hands drop from his face as he raises his head up. That awful feeling of great realization touches on the edge of his mind. Even as he recognizes it and how it’s going to hit him like a wave, it advances.</p><p>“<em>Oh</em>,” Kaveh says simply as he’s hit by the gravity of epiphany.</p><p>What a hypocrite he is. How ridiculously blind he’s been. It’s amazing he didn’t realize it until he was telling it to a house of all things.</p><p>When you share your grief with someone who knows it, it helps. <em>Obviously</em> <em>yes</em>. Yes.</p><p>It’s over for Kaveh’s father. He’s never coming back. There’s no second chance there. What’s gone never comes back to you.</p><p>But there are people who knew his father, who suffered that same irreversible loss.</p><p>Kaveh’s mother remembers and feels that loss, still, although she’s done much more with it than Kaveh’s managed. Or at least, Kaveh hopes she has. He never asked. He never talked about his father with her. He was too afraid to upset her, to draw her attention to what he felt was his own role in his father’s death. He was frightened of speaking of it. At first because to speak of it made it real in ways he couldn’t comprehend, and then later because to speak of it would mean he would have to address it, and then it just became habit.</p><p>He had always known that his guilt and his shame took up large portions of himself. Heavy and oppressive, lingering at the back of his mind for its chance.</p><p>And he’d denied it this entire time. Pushed it away, out of sight and out of mind. If he ignored it long enough it would either go away on its own or…well. He’d just keep ignoring it. But Kaveh never really let himself…look at it. Hold it. Feel it. Kaveh never let his grief go. He never permitted himself to walk through it and feel it and process it. As soon as it started to hurt and become too present, Kaveh would shove it away and distract himself with other things. Other regrets, other motivations, other problems and distractions.</p><p>Kaveh’s thinks of his father’s books, now. They know. Just like houses. They know. They know who they want to read them. They know who shares their grief. Kaveh turns his imagination towards those books. What must it be like for those books who’ve carried the secrets of a man long gone by themselves for years upon years, only for that man’s son to deny them their purpose? </p><p>As Kaveh had said, the purpose of written communication is to communicate. And as Al-Haitham said it was like a negotiation, a conversation. But Kaveh was not interested in a conversation. He was not interested in thinking. He just wanted to be <em>told</em> the basics, the essential facts, so he could say he’d gone through it and have it all be done without him ever looking close.</p><p>He wanted it over. Not resolved. Checked off the list without any true understanding.</p><p>Just like all of the people who mourn the Akasha and its convenience. Gods, Kaveh’s such a hypocrite. And even worse—a <em>coward</em>.</p><p>What has Kaveh done to himself? Or rather—what has Kaveh <em>failed</em> to do for himself?</p><p>Kaveh never had that conversation. He never tried. And here he is telling the house to do that. To heal. To air out its wounds and work through them with the person involved.</p><p>He never gave that to himself. He certainly never even hinted at that being on the table with his own mother. Gods, and every time he and Al-Haitham came close to it he just turned on the vitriol. Kaveh tried to move through it all like a ghost, as though he weren’t part of it at all. And how can anything heal with that kind of superficial care? It was as though Kaveh slapped a new coat of paint on a house, gave it a fresh sweep and a wax, then said it was good as new despite the fact that its foundations were literally sinking into the ground and all of its load bearing walls and beams were rotted through with cracks large enough to fit a finger into.</p><p>“I’ve been absolutely vile,” Kaveh declares, squaring his shoulders. Gods. Kaveh feels raw. Like he just threw up for hours and got shoved through a torrent and maybe had all of his skin peeled off on top of it. But his mind feels sharp. Clear. Horrifically so. All the better to understand the many, many ways he’s gone astoundingly wrong. Some Light of the Kshahrewar he turned out to be.</p><p>Kaveh turns, eyes trained in the distance towards the place that he’s been coming to recognize over the past several months as though it were truly his own to recognize.</p><p>“I’ll get your answer later,” Kaveh says to the house even as he’s moving to leave, to return, to face the night, “there’s a conversation that needs to be had.”</p><p>When Kaveh returns to the house Al-Haitham is not present, but that’s fine. <em>That</em> is a conversation for another day. An overdue one (in many regards), certainly, but it is not the one he meant.</p><p>He walks to his room and, of course, the box is already out and waiting for him on his desk. The photograph of his mother just barely visible around the corner of it. When Kaveh flicks the lights in the room on, they all seem to direct themselves towards the closed box.</p><p>Kaveh’s hands do not shake because he is a Kshahrewar through and through. But his heart quavers in his chest and for a brief moment the guilt, the shame, the grief, rises up and flashes across his eyes. But Kaveh’s hands have never failed him even once so they land true to the target, staying the course. He hears the lid of the box open even if his eyes refuse to focus to see it. He feels that first book in his hands as he takes it up.</p><p>Kaveh closes his eyes and turns towards himself. All of himself in its uneven totality. All of that supposed light had to have darkness waiting around somewhere. And he has let it grown wild with neglect. It is time, Kaveh understands, to clean house. And that means looking at the unpleasant; the cowardly; the bitter; the splenetic and choleric; the pale and the wounded; the resentful and the remorseful.</p><p>“I want,” Kaveh says to himself as he holds his father’s memory in his hands, “to be free of this. It is part of me. It will always be part of me. But I am tired of it <em>being</em> me. I am tired of these circles we go around in. The highs and the lows with the highs seemingly designed for the sole purpose of emphasizing the fall.”</p><p>Kaveh addresses the boy, the teenager, the young man who held fire in his hands and ran with it.</p><p>“I’m tired of apologizing for something that wasn’t mine to bear. And I am tired of this thing coming back to ruin me whenever I think I’ve made steps forward because I, in reality, have not. I am jaded, I am twice-burned, I am gutted and I am aggrieved. And it is terrible to be these things. But I am also <em>Kaveh</em>, Master Architect, son of Faranak. And I am not a coward. Nor am I a liar. My parents did not raise me to be one. There is a mark I want to make upon this world and I cannot make it when I’m trying to erase myself at the same time.”</p><p>Kaveh addresses the man who is still in that fire and has yet to pull himself out of it.</p><p>“I have wronged myself. Cheated myself. Enough. I refuse to go the rest of my life with this dangling over my head like a sword ready to drop. I have survived all of my dreams burning around me and I have survived dragging them out of the ash. I’ll be damned if the thing that does me in is my own self. Since when did I shy away from work? From pain? From strife? Well, Kshahrewar. Time to get to work.”</p><p>Kaveh’s hands, strangely enough, by the end of his silly but entirely necessary speech to himself, feel warm.</p><p>Kaveh opens his eyes and goes still when he realizes that his father’s journal has opened up in his hands. He didn’t actually mean to read it. He just wanted to hold it. Step one in what he thought might be a prolonged project involving incremental exposure, or the like.</p><p>He braces himself to see nothing, but Kaveh’s eyes land upon the page and his father’s voice begins to flow through his mind.</p><p>Kaveh feels his knees start to bend and give, his heart start to pang, eyes watering, but the image before him remains clear, as does the writing. Kaveh’s hands remain steady as he traces his fingertips over the paper. Over his own name. Over his mother’s. His father’s. All together. A photograph taken the day before his father left for the Inter-Darshan competition of his year.</p><p>Steady on, Kaveh’s hands move to flip to the front of the book, the journal. The pages are soft underneath his fingertips, and warm as though they had soaked in the sun. Kaveh finds himself sitting on the floor, leaning forward into the pages as though he could fall right in as he catches glimpses of sketches, more photographs, line upon slightly crooked line of writing, all the way until the first page, which the book stays open to.</p><p>Kaveh begins to read.</p>

<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>“Let me try again with the house,” Kaveh says quietly as Al-Haitham looks at their younger selves from a different life. “One more time.

Books upon books upon books with cracked spines and scribbles all along the margins. “One more chance.”</p><p>Al-Haitham breathes out long and slow. And then he says, quietly, wondrously, “I should know better by now.”</p><p>His fingers are warm when he taps the back of Kaveh’s hand. Kaveh’s wrist turns, fingers opening.

<p>He’s not quite sure what he expected to read when he went through his father’s papers. Studies, research, maybe one or two personal communications like the letter to his mother. He supposed one or two of the journals might be of a personal nature like his mother’s. But almost <em>all</em> of them are personal. They jump around in time and date. Rather than writing in one consistently, his father was jumping between several different journals at once. It looks like he must have had them in different places so he could write down whatever thoughts struck him right then and there. Some of the journals are tiny notebooks just a bit smaller than Kaveh’s palm. Others are the size of full tomes. </p><p>It’s nothing quite as neat or organized as his mother’s journal, which she wrote in like how most other people might write in a journal. One single entry that’s almost like a winding-down exercise for the day or perhaps a meditative exercise where she wrote of her day or whatever thoughts had come with her since her last entry.</p><p>Kaveh’s father is all over the place, quite literally. Sometimes there’s multiple little entries from different dates on one page. Sometimes there’ll be several pages of random notes—calculations, grocery lists, schedules—and then a single front to back page of extremely personal stream-of-thought pondering. His father put in various bits in between the pages, too. Receipts, ripped out pages of other books, sketches, charts, photographs. It’s a dizzying and confounding view into the man’s mind.</p><p><em>And what a mind it was.</em> Kaveh’s father writes about everything from extremely in-depth philosophical questions where he argues against himself with rather astounding skill to the point where Kaveh’s head is spinning and he can’t tell whether he agrees or disagrees and with whom. He also writes about scientific studies he’d reviewed from the Amurta and Spantamad, questioning them and hypothesizing further theories that might come around with further study. His father references every school at different points, showing remarkable depth and breadth of knowledge although within his father’s own pages the man notes himself an amateur compared to his friends and colleagues.</p><p>Kaveh doesn’t finish that first journal that night because it’s so dense, and because he finds himself going through the others to try and find the chronological order of it. There <em>must</em> be one, because Al-Haitham said there was. And there sort of is. Al-Haitham roughly grouped different documents based on time period rather than by exact date. The deeper into the box Kaveh goes, the farther back the date range seems to reach. It covers a surprising range despite the fact that these were supposedly just gathered from his office and from the investigation the Matra were finally able to launch. He would have thought most of his father’s things were with them. As in, Kaveh and his mother. Apparently not.</p><p>Kaveh reads through the night, moving from the floor to his bed. He must fall asleep for a bit because he wakes up. And when he wakes up the books are all still waiting for him.</p><p>And Kaveh, now that he’s started, can’t bear to stop. It took so much for him to finally <em>begin</em>. If he stops now who knows what sort of cowardice he’ll back himself into? Kaveh writes a message to the Akademiya and everyone he has an appointment with for the next week or so, sending his apologies but an emergency has come up. Kaveh needs to take time away. He sends Mehrak off to deliver those messages to a courier as he throws himself back into the reading.</p><p>In Kaveh’s entire professional career he’s only ever called out sick or taken last-minute time away due to extreme emergencies. He thinks the last time he did this it was because he was literally so sick he couldn’t stand.</p><p>It’s time that Kaveh took some actual time to take care of himself. Purposeful time. It’s time that Kaveh stood still and let things catch up.</p><p>It is not easy. As fascinating as his father’s writing is and as much as Kaveh finds himself dragged into the thought process and eager to find out what he’ll read next, it’s painful. Sometimes Kaveh will find himself lowering the pages in his hands, turning his head to the side as his eyes fall closed. He’ll be out of breath because he was holding it—the muscles that control respiration frozen with tension and longing, all of that grief held back by the iron self-control born from denial that Kaveh’s honed over the past several years.</p><p>There will be moments where Kaveh will forget what he’s reading is from his father. He’ll be so engrossed in it that he’ll forget what it is he’s doing here and then suddenly, his mother’s name will leap out from the pages at him. Or his own. And his ears will ring with the sound of his father’s voice, as that voice takes over the reading and Kaveh has to stop. He <em>has</em> to stop and put his face in his hands or stand up and walk away, pace the room. And he has to wait for the waves of hurt to settle enough for him to focus again. If they pull him under he’s going to stop and walk away and he might never work up the will to start again.</p><p>As Kaveh makes his slow progress Kaveh remembers in small bits and pieces. It was like reading his mother’s journals as he learned about the parts of her that he never thought to ask about, except this hurts <em>more</em> somehow. Perhaps it’s because Kaveh is in the writing himself and his father writes about things Kaveh doesn’t remember—things he was part of and yet cannot remember consciously shaping. Perhaps it’s because his father writes of a boy that Kaveh can’t remember being and there’s a strange guilt to that, too.</p><p>Or maybe it’s because of the distance. The forgetting. Maybe it’s about how he forgot his father’s voice, his face. But now here they are, so clear that it’s as though his father is in the room too. Kaveh can even smell his father’s cologne—he’d never been able to find it before. His mother had a bottle of it. But Kaveh could never bring himself to ask her where his father bought it from and when Kaveh would be shopping he would never find that specific smell whenever he would be perusing the shops. </p><p>Maybe it’s because, until now, Kaveh didn’t <em>let</em> himself remember any of it. The good that came before that wretched question of an end. But he’s remembering it now. Forcing himself to remember, really, to turn to the memories that he was so close to burying forever and bringing them back.</p><p>It hurts. Kaveh can’t even tell if it hurts in a <em>good</em> way or if it’s just pain. But he does know that this is necessary. So Kaveh moves through all of those documents, page by page. And he lets himself be carried through the good, the ugly, and all the other things he couldn’t bring himself to ever think on. </p><p>It is a journey that takes Kaveh almost a whole week to get through. And at the end of it, he doesn’t know if he’s even processed it all but he’s sitting at his desk with all of those papers and books and the like back in the box and he’s got that folded flower of a letter in front of him. He hasn’t read it. He thinks that he shouldn’t be the first for this one. Kaveh takes his pen up, a fresh sheet of paper, and writes to his mother. He writes to her of how he’s gone through his father’s things and how difficult it was. He writes about how there’s so much he doesn’t understand, even now, but how he hopes that he’s better for having read them. </p><p>He writes that he’d like to bring these to her in Fontaine, personally. Because he wants to ask her about some of the things contained within. And he would like for her to go through them too, and then afterwards they can talk about it together. Also, if possible, he would like to keep some of his father’s papers. They could choose together.</p><p>-</p><p>Kaveh returns to meeting with clients and holding his classes, catching up on the work he missed as quickly as possible while dodging questions about what happened to call him away. This is a topic that he is just learning to approach without digging his heels into the ground. It is not one he is ready to speak of openly. </p><p>But it <em>is</em> one that he is ready to speak of. No. It is one that he <em>must</em> speak of. The topic of his father’s journals, of Kaveh’s grief, is not one that is isolated to Kaveh alone. Nor is it one even constrained to Kaveh and his mother.</p><p>Kaveh knocks on Al-Haitham’s door. He’d come back too late to catch Al-Haitham at dinner as he was sorting things out with a particularly difficult client, who wasn’t exactly pleased to have been put off for a week. Kaveh ended up just quitting. The client was even less pleased by <em>that</em>. But Kaveh had not technically missed any deadlines when he cancelled their last meeting; all of the work for that project was on ahead of schedule; and quite frankly the client’s attitude was not even made up for with the size of the commission fee. </p><p>When he returned Al-Haitham had already retreated to his room for the evening. But he was not asleep because not even Al-Haitham sleeps this early.</p><p>After Kaveh knocks there’s no answer. Kaveh can’t even hear movement on the other side of the door. But Kaveh waits. He knows Al-Haitham is in there because he can feel Al-Haitham’s Vision on the other side of the door. The washroom is empty and so is the study. The back door was closed and when Kaveh glanced out the window into the back courtyard it was empty. Unless there was a secret room the house came up with when Kaveh wasn’t paying attention, Al-Haitham is in here.</p><p>Finally Kaveh hears the faint rustle of fabric and then the door opens. Al-Haitham’s cool face looks back out at him.</p><p>“Firstly, you were right.”</p><p>“I know.” Al-Haitham’s answer is immediate and delivered flatly, tiredly. Not a trace of smugness or vindication. Not even any lingering anger. Just the exhaustion of someone who’s going through familiar motions. Kaveh supposes that they’ve blown up at each other enough for this to be its own routine. Although the last few times it has been Al-Haitham at Kaveh’s door with his own offerings of peace to open negotiations towards armistice. It’s been a while since it was Kaveh doing the calling of ceasefire.</p><p>Kaveh raises his hand and holds up the silver key. Al-Haitham’s hand moves to take it but Kaveh’s fingers close around the metal, Al-Haitham’s fingertips hitting against Kaveh’s own. Kaveh feels rotten about holding the key as collateral, and he fully intends on giving it back tonight no matter how this unfolds, but first: “I want to talk.”</p><p>Al-Haitham’s brows raise up just at tick even as his hand falls away, arms crossing over his chest. “Oh?”</p><p>Kaveh lowers the closed hand with the key, nodding and tipping his chin to gesture into Al-Haitham’s room. “May I?”</p><p>There is a moment when past, present, and future overlap over Al-Haitham’s face. The past memory of all the other times they’ve fallen apart to attempt to drag themselves back together combined with that awful bloodless face of Al-Haitham’s rage is combined with the present weariness. And over it a future of more anger, more hurt, more resignation. Kaveh can see them doing this over and over again or the rest of their lives. They probably will. For all of the good they accomplish together there’s so much mess that goes into it before they can reach that goodness. They always learn the hard way first; work for it. Their first tries always provide a breadth of errors to learn from. </p><p>This overlapping series of faces, for a solid moment, looks like they’re going to close the door on Kaveh and do the sensible thing of putting a stop to their ongoing wreck right then and there. Kaveh’s been on that side of their arguments too.</p><p>But Al-Haitham’s sharp eyes move from Kaveh’s face to the hand with the key, and in the process, he sees what’s in Kaveh’s other hand. One of Kaveh’s father’s journals. And Al-Haitham is not an idiot. They may have been avoiding each other, but Al-Haitham couldn’t have missed the fact that Kaveh’s cancelled all of his appointments and schedules and stayed home for the past week, shut up in his room completely silent.</p><p>Al-Haitham’s jaw works, lips pressed together, before he lets out a sharp sigh through his nose. His arms fall away and he turns, “Fine.”</p><p>They sit on the edge of Al-Haitham’s bed, an arm’s width apart. It’s not like there’s anywhere else to sit. </p><p>“Well? Talk. Some of us have standard schedules to keep in order to earn our wage.”</p><p>Kaveh holds his hand out between them, fingers opening. The key glitters in his hand, catching the warm lights of Al-Haitham’s room.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Kaveh begins. Al-Haitham reaches out, carefully taking the key from Kaveh’s palm—slowly like he thinks Kaveh might snatch it back. Kaveh watches Al-Haitham examine the key, thumb running over the intricate head and the teeth before enclosing it into his own palm. “For using that key to get you to talk to me, firstly. But also for all of the things I said to you. There’s no excuse I can give you. They won’t mean anything.”</p><p>“No, they wouldn’t.”</p><p>“As to the matter of you being right—yes. In a way, I understood what you were saying, what you actually meant. But at the same time, I <em>could not</em> understand. You were right. I did not <em>want</em> to understand. I—couldn’t. Even now, after reading all of this I still can’t. Not really.” Kaveh holds the journal in his hands, rubbing his thumb along soft edge. “For the longest time I couldn’t. I physically couldn’t. To go through the grief, to feel it touch upon my conscious mind, was to undo myself entirely. It was not…the <em>right</em> thing to do. But it was what I <em>had</em> to do. At least, for a time. It was a matter of survival when I was younger. When it was fresh and everything was changing so rapidly. Then I was in the Akademiya and my mother was in Fontaine, and then it just because a series of excuses and poor habits. It was comfortable in the dark. Stable. Familiar. It was not sustainable stability, of course. I would have to move through instability of resolution at some point. But not all of us are built for it. It’s not so neat, so tidy, so straightforward. For the longest time it took everything I had to stand at that threshold. After everything, could you blame me for wanting to take the path of least resistance for <em>once</em> in my life?”</p><p>“I know. I could. I <em>do</em>.” Al-Haitham says flatly without hesitation. “Because you are not a coward. You have been cowardly, in the past. But at the core of you, that is not what you are.” Al-Haitham’s voice, then, does this strange thing where it does not turn soft or gentle. But the urgency of it, the intent of it, presses forward like a hand against the heart. “When it matters, Kaveh,<em> I know you</em>. And this is what frustrates me about you; what disappoints me.” Kaveh closes his eyes. Al-Haitham’s truths, even when given with a raw and bloody heart surrendered on the side, feel too violent to choke down. “You would spit at the world to deny and shame its deficiencies, its shortcomings, its fallacies and its failures. Given any chance you’d fight the world with your bare fists to uphold the ideals and standards you believe should prevail over all. But when it comes to <em>you</em>—you’d sooner drown.”</p><p><em>I know,</em> Kaveh doesn’t say. Because knowing doesn’t fix anything. Kaveh doesn’t apologize either, because this is not something about himself that he’s going to be able to change. At least, not in the span of a week. It will take, he’s sure, a lifetime. Just like the grief that helped to build it.</p><p>So instead Kaveh answers, “I am learning to swim. But I am not a naturally gifted student, and failing and struggling at something alone makes me cruel, especially when other people point it out to me. It was uncalled for—all of the things I said to you. I’m sorry that I said them. I’m sorry that I lied. And I am sorry if you thought I meant them for even a moment, or if you ever thought they might be true.”</p><p>Out of the corner of Kaveh’s eye, Al-Haitham’s head slowly dips down. “I know.”</p><p>Al-Haitham always says exactly what he means, even if Kaveh does not understand it. But there is even more in what Al-Haitham that does not say. And so, Al-Haitham acknowledges the regret, but does not forgive it. And Kaveh knows that this is deserved. It is Al-Haitham’s to handle as he sees fit.</p><p>Kaveh holds out the journal between them. “They didn’t show you any of their contents. So you never saw what he wrote.”</p><p>“No.” Al-Haitham’s head turns slightly towards him, voice low and cautious. </p><p>“I’ll leave you after this,” Kaveh promises, “but first I want to show you something in here. It’s…important. More important than my apology. Will you let me share it with you?”</p><p>Al-Haitham’s eyes move from the journal to Kaveh and back again before he nods. “Yes.”</p><p>As Kaveh went through his father’s journals, his father used short-hand abbreviations or nicknames to refer to people, several at a time. It makes sense as his father probably never thought anyone else would read the entries. Kaveh figured they were friends, colleagues, acquaintances, people he worked with or for on various projects and the like. Neighbors or family members, too. Certain names or monikers would come up over and over, and Kaveh eventually learned which ones were related and the loose circles that they might have formed.</p><p>But it took Kaveh a few days to realize that some of the people mentioned in the entries were also in photographs. And it took Kaveh almost a fully day of cross-referencing with Mehrak helping him keep things sorted to get a rough idea of who was who.</p><p>There were a lot of references to Kaveh and his mother, of course. His father’s own family, and his in-laws. But he had a close circle of friends that would come up frequently enough. It was one specific picture, however, that caused Kaveh’s brain to have an epiphany of sorts.</p><p>His mother wrote of her own friends, too, and she left behind a few pictures. But it was that one picture from when he first opened her journal that returned to him as key. It was the picture of his father, and the other men with him. At the time, Kaveh was so overwhelmed that he wasn’t paying attention to anyone else. But when Kaveh looked at one of the photographs and a short phrase in one of his father’s entries, and then looked back at his mother’s photograph, the dots connected.</p><p>The man in his mother’s photograph, next to Kaveh’s father, and the one referenced in his father’s journal, was <em>Al-Haitham’s</em> father. And the woman that his mother befriended at the gathering was<em> Al-Haitham’s</em> mother, who would also later be referenced in Kaveh’s father’s entries. And the both of them show up in a few pictures—separate or together, with Kaveh’s parents, and a few of their other friends who were also in his mother’s photograph.</p><p>And once Kaveh saw that connection he had to put everything down and walk out of the house to stand in the back courtyard and just breathe with his head tipped back, throat stretched so far it hurt, eyes staring up and up and up into the sky. He wanted to laugh. He also wanted to curse. In the end he exhaled so long his chest ached, turned around, and walked right back into the house to start marking pages that mentioned Al-Haitham’s family and put pictures aside.</p><p>As Kaveh opens the journal it immediately flips to the specific entry Kaveh wanted. It’s a mess of scribbled down times and addresses, crossed out, circled, and the like one one side. But his father starts writing underneath that part and goes on for about a page and a half. Kaveh points to the part he wants Al-Haitham to read.</p><p>In this page Kaveh’s father writes about how one of his friends is now a father too. It was a particularly trying and difficult birth. He and his wife have gone back to his mother’s house to ask her help in caring for the baby while his wife recovers. They have an ancestral estate in the countryside. Once the his wife is well and his son is healthy enough, he’s going to invite the rest of their friends to visit.</p><p><em>His name is Al-Haitham</em>, Kaveh’s father wrote<em>. A strong name. A bold one. I hope that this child grows into it well. May he not suffer. And may he someday be friends with Kaveh. Kaveh could use more of those. </em></p><p>Kaveh’s father goes on to write about how much of a relief it is that it was Al-Haitham’s mother who named him, because apparently Al-Haitham’s father has no sense for names.</p><p>As Al-Haitham reads, the pages move on their own, skipping between themselves to bring them to the next mention of Al-Haitham’s father, or mother, or himself. Brief phrases, sentences, allusions. And then once the journal is done with those, it flips itself all the way to the very back where Kaveh had carefully placed all of the photographs he’d found in the box of documents that involved Al-Haitham’s family in some way.</p><p>Al-Haitham reads all of this in silence, evenly, calmly. As though he were reading something that didn’t involve him at all. Kaveh, distantly, understands it. Just a little. After all, Al-Haitham’s parents passed away when he was very young. Al-Haitham doesn’t remember them. </p><p>As Al-Haitham carefully looks through the photographs he has the expression of someone going through the motions. Kaveh expected this much. But then Al-Haitham’s hands stutter when he hits one of the two pictures Kaveh knew Al-Haitham needed to see more than anyone in the world.</p><p>Kaveh doesn’t lean over to look. But he knows the photograph Al-Haitham has stopped on. Al-Haitham slowly lowers the journal onto the bed between them along with the other photographs. Holding this one carefully.</p><p>It’s a picture of Kaveh’s mother and Al-Haitham’s mother. They are standing in front of the jasmine gate. Al-Haitham’s grandmother stands in between them, smiling as the two women each put an arm around her shoulders. Kaveh’s not sure what the occasion was, if any. It wasn’t mentioned in any of the entries he saw. Maybe a note about it exists in another journal of his father’s, somewhere else. Or maybe he never noted it.</p><p>Al-Haitham holds that picture in silence for a long time. Kaveh waits, quietly flipping through his father’s journal—not looking for anything particular, but just wanting to see the writing as it is.</p><p>Al-Haitham slowly moves to put that photograph aside from the last one, pausing, looking at it again, then repeating the cycle four or five more times. Then he finally sets it aside to be surprised with the last photograph.</p><p>It’s Al-Haitham as a baby, small and round. He’s on that quilted blanket. And so is Kaveh, a toddler, right next to him. The both of them are huddled on their stomachs, fast asleep. Someone’s hand is in the frame, holding Al-Haitham’s small baby fist. There’s a teething toy and the corner of a picture book visible, too. But it’s Kaveh and Al-Haitham.</p><p>Kaveh wonders, now, if that house recognized him. Was that part of the reason why Kaveh was allowed in when all others weren’t? Maybe the reason why the papers opened up to Al-Haitham was because they recognized him, too. Kaveh certainly doesn’t remember ever going before, but then again—there are a lot of things Kaveh doesn’t remember. He knows Al-Haitham certainly won’t remember this. But how incredibly fitting that others remembered for them. How great a gift.</p><p>“Let me try again with the house,” Kaveh says quietly as Al-Haitham looks at their younger selves from a different life. “One more time. Please.” Kaveh closes his eyes. Dal. Rose and jasmine, bakhoor. A blanket highlighted with speckles of rainbows from a glass lotus. Books upon books upon books with cracked spines and scribbles all along the margins. “One more chance.”</p><p>Al-Haitham breathes out long and slow. And then he says, quietly, wondrously, “I should know better by now.”</p><p>His fingers are warm when he taps the back of Kaveh’s hand. Kaveh’s wrist turns, fingers opening. The key, metal warmed, is gently placed into Kaveh’s palm as Al-Haitham finishes answering, “But it’s you.”</p><p>-</p><p>When Kaveh returns to the ancestral house to make one last push and get its answer, he’s shocked to see how much its backslid in such a short amount of time. Yes, he’d not exactly left it on the best of notes—but with the remarkable progress it’s made in the past few months he thought it would hold itself together at least a little better. From the moment Kaveh crosses the jasmine threshold, he’s plunged into something worse than silence.</p><p>It’s an echo. An echo that’s absorbed the entire property. Kaveh goes still, one foot in and one foot out.</p><p>The front courtyard is grey, drained of color and movement. The shadows have returned with all of their grief, and have sunk deep into root and stone, filling them with dread. As though whatever has haunted this house has returned in full force to not just haunt, but actively ruin. </p><p><em>This</em>, Kaveh realizes, <em>this is it</em>. This is the moment that caused the house to break and turn Al-Haitham out. This is the root of the thorn that has pierced its heart. This is the grief.</p><p>All of that grief, once pushed back, now taking center stage as the property relives it over and over again, sinking into its despair with the comfort of a routine reopening of the wound. </p><p>As Kaveh walks up to the house his steps are soundless. Kaveh can’t even hear his own breathing. That’s how strong the echo is. The only thing here is grief, the grief of that echo. The shadows are deep, the colors are faded, and the temperature isn’t cold exactly but the air feels drained and dead. </p><p>This isn’t the same as the first time he was here, when the death and the grief were so furious, so painful that it became violence.</p><p>This is just sorrow. This is just hurt. Does the house even realize he’s here?</p><p>The key turns in the lock. Soundless. The door opens. Mute. And Kaveh enters the house which stands in silent, resigned, sorrowful desaturated near-monochrome.</p><p>Light is thin through the house, reluctant. Kaveh looks around the front room and tries to see where the actual movement of the echo begins or ends. Where is it happening? Where is the center of it?</p><p>And then, Kaveh hears the soft tread of feet getting closer. Kaveh turns in time to see the clearest form of memory he’s ever seen in this house walk towards him.</p><p>It is Al-Haitham. Short, thin, the most color in the entire house at this moment in time but not by much. Al-Haitham’s expression is blank, mouth a straight line, and eyes focused straight ahead. He is just barely up to Kaveh’s chest and he is narrow. Like a bird. Al-Haitham’s bare feet walk one in front of the other, turning past Kaveh towards the kitchen. His clothes are wrinkled. They’re a strange mix of somehow being too small and too large at once. His hair is limp, although neatly combed.</p><p>Kaveh follows him into the kitchen and watches as Al-Haitham goes about pulling out dishes, heating food, preparing tea, and warming bread. Then he sits down at the table with all of this food and stares at it. Al-Haitham pushes some of it around the plate. Eats. Stops. Pushes it around some more. Eats. Stops. Then he gets up and puts it all away. He tidies up the kitchen. Stands there for a full minute of just staring at nothing. And then he walks out again.</p><p>Then, before Kaveh can follow, Al-Haitham comes back. His clothes are different. He walks through Kaveh and starts gathering food from the kitchen. He makes tea. He sets the table. He sits down. Al-Haitham pushes food around. He eats. Pushes food around. Nibbles. Gets up and starts putting things away. </p><p>Kaveh can hear the click of cutlery, the rush of water through the pipes, the crackle of flames. Kaveh can hear the light scrape of the chair as Al-Haitham pulls it out and pushes it back in. He can hear the sound of water coming to a boil and he can hear the sound of Al-Haitham’s footsteps. He can hear the sound of the spoon against the pot and the crunch of Al-Haitham’s teeth against an apple or a pear. </p><p>But he cannot hear Al-Haitham. Al-Haitham makes no sound as he moves through the echo. Not a word spoken. Not even a sigh.</p><p>The echo repeats. Over and over and over again. Except it is not exactly the same echo. It’s still Al-Haitham. Doing the exact same thing with variation. His clothes change. The food he eats changes. The amount he cooks and eats decreases. Al-Haitham gets thinner. He never makes a sound.</p><p>The house starts to leave fruit out for him. It splits right down the middle as Al-Haitham approaches. As the echo repeats, Al-Haitham doesn’t even bother to cook anything. He opens a few cupboards. Closes them. He prepares some tea. He warms a bit of bread. Maybe a few spoonfuls of curry. He sits with whatever fruit the house has desperately put before him. He chokes down a few bites. And stops.</p><p>He’s so thin.</p><p>And then one day, Al-Haitham comes to a complete stop in the middle of the kitchen. He has not yet begun to prepare the tea, or pick at the bread, or stare at the fruit. He just stands there. Completely still, eyes staring at nothing. And then he turns around and walks right back out. </p><p>Kaveh follows as he feels the echo’s center moving away from the kitchen. Al-Haitham grabs a couple of books off of the shelf, pushes his feet into the shoes by the door, and walks out.</p><p>The house, distantly, in memory and now, starts to weep.</p><p>And then the echo begins from the very beginning. Kaveh turns and sees Al-Haitham walk into the kitchen. Over and over and over and over again. The walk out of it following the path he’d just taken into it. And then one repetition has Al-Haitham walking out and instead of going back into the depths of the house he walks out the front door.</p><p>Even as Al-Haitham is walking out the door, Al-Haitham is already behind him, repeating that first day after the death, the first in the mourning period, as he walks into the kitchen as he begins three months of total entirely self-created silence.</p><p>This, Kaveh realizes, is the day that the house locked itself to Al-Haitham. This is the day Al-Haitham left to clear his head and was not allowed to return. The echo was Al-Haitham after his grandmother’s death—and the grief. The silence. The deterioration.</p><p>Kaveh looks around even as the echo replays itself, moving faster and faster as it loops those three months over and over and over again, despairing the entire time. This is it. This was the key. The house loves Al-Haitham. That’s fact. That’s the seemingly incongruous fact that Kaveh’s been trying to reconcile with the result of exile this entire time.</p><p>Why would a house that loves its occupant refuse that occupant entry?</p><p>Because the entry would kill him. Because to return and cross that jasmine threshold would be walking into death, and the house had enough of itself to know it couldn’t let that happen to the last good thing it ever had.</p><p>Didn’t Kaveh say it before? Too much tragedy makes a house strange, <em>wrong</em>. If it absorbs too much darkness without some brightness to balance out, it gets swallowed up in its history.</p><p>Kaveh thinks back through the years, the facts.</p><p>Al-Haitham is the last of his living kin with a direct tie to the house, the last one who grew up in its walls and cared for it. Before him came his parents, who died young and left Al-Haitham to the house and Al-Haitham’s grandmother. Al-Haitham’s grandmother who left Al-Haitham, too.</p><p><em>And what in your life</em>, Kaveh spa<em>t, was there to love when they were already lost to you as foregone conclusions?</em></p><p>Everyone Al-Haitham and this house had to love and be loved by died before their time. Before there was <em>enough</em> time. The house has a whole graveyard’s worth of them. Some old, some young. And with several of those deaths in a short amount of time.</p><p>Kaveh imagines it. The house welcoming in a young boy, a boy it’d known as it knew all the others since their birth. And watching him grow. All the while, every room slowly emptying and going still. No one there to tend to them. Just an old woman and a young child. And then—just the child. And then, the child slowly fading away too. After that, what? Then there would be nothing at all. Nothing at all left.</p><p>And the grief, the wanting, oh—it makes for poor living. No boy could grow up here like that. Not with all that grief. The silence. The sorrow. Kaveh watches as the echoes of Al-Haitham get thinner, perfectly mute as they go through the motions of eating but not being able to complete the effort.</p><p>His mother wrote back to him recently with a heavy admission that have Kaveh walking around in a foggy daze the rest of the day, useless to anyone and most of all himself.</p><p><em>Kaveh</em>, his mother wrote.<em> You have no idea how much you helped me. I do not mean when you gave me the push to leave Sumeru and go to Fontaine. I mean before that. If I did not have you, Kaveh, I do not know if I could have survived it. The surviving. The being left behind. I saw your father everywhere and in everything. His echo touched everything and sometimes I felt like it was too much. But I would hear you, I would see you. And I would remember that I had to get up again. Because it was not just me who was left behind. It was us. Because I had you, Kaveh, I survived it.</em></p><p>Now, Kaveh’s great imagination turns its powers towards thrusting him into the worst possible situation. Kaveh imagines being fourteen years old. And for the past unknown amount of months he’s’ been watching his mother die, feeding her—caring for her to ease her way as much as possible. And it’s just him and his dying mother and it’s this great big house that he also has to take care of and it’s himself. And then it’s just Kaveh and a large house meant for a full family not a single boy. </p><p>How terrible. How crushing. How absolutely draining.</p><p>The house was going to lose Al-Haitham to that grief, that silence. And it knew it as fact, inevitability. It loved him and it knew. It knew that there was no saving either of them like that. The house would be soaked up in all of that grief and tip over that edge that houses aren’t meant to cross, and Al-Haitham would quietly go with it. Wouldn’t it be better if at least one of them made it out with a chance at recovery?</p><p>“Oh, you do <em>love</em> him,” Kaveh whispers as his own memories take over.</p><p>His mother holds his hands so tightly, and she looks at him like he might evaporate into the air. And it takes everything Kaveh has to keep his voice steady. But his hands don’t shake because he is her son and he takes her face into his hands and kisses her goodbye on each cheek. “Go,” Kaveh tells his mother, the letter with a job offer from Fontaine sitting between them from where he’d fished it out of the trash. “<em>Go</em>.”</p><p>This, Kaveh understands. Kaveh understands it so <em>perfectly</em>.</p><p>He remembers her waving to him on the ship to Fontaine, she never stopped waving. He doesn’t think she stopped waving and looking at him until her ship was long gone. Because Kaveh never stopped looking back out at the ship as it left, either.</p><p>“We never get over the grief, do we?” Kaveh says as the house weeps through the echo of the moment it knew it couldn’t keep Al-Haitham no matter how much it would hurt. “We did such a fantastic job of pretending. But it’s always been with us. The entire time. And it just grows and takes everything with it, becoming other things along the way.” Kaveh’s thinks of the ice, that clay and shadowed figure, the wailing, the shadows, the creaking and groaning. “We made our homes in it, stories out of it. Entire lives.” He thinks of the other echoes, the kinder ones, that layered on top of the shadows to push them aside for a moment. “We placed other things on top, but that base layer was always there and waiting.”</p><p>The house, around him, sobs. Shadows of rain slide down over the walls even though the windows are clear. The echoes of Al-Haitham are layered over themselves and moving so fast that it’s like there’s hundreds of him, all moving at once following after each other one after another. Getting thinner and thinner. Dimmer and dimmer.</p><p><em>Al-Haitham,</em> Kaveh thinks.<em> Oh, Al-Haitham.</em></p><p>Here is the house’s grief. And here is Kaveh with his own. But what of Al-Haitham’s? His grief? Did he get over it? Did he do as Kaveh failed to do and confronted it, worked his way through it and come to peace with it? In all this talk of grief and grieving, for all that Kaveh can recognize that there must be something that Al-Haitham lost in all of this—it’s not like Al-Haitham has ever spoken of it. Referred to it. He’s always spoken to it as if it was past, or perhaps as though it happened to someone else. All of Al-Haitham’s losses were discussed so factually, so impersonally. Kaveh had assumed that meant the man had made peace with it.</p><p>But how could he? Al-Haitham never had the chance to. How can you observe and work with something you can’t see? All of the things that would have helped him with his grief are here. In this house. As Kaveh told the house—the one person who would understand him, who could share his grief and work through it with him shut him out entirely.</p><p>The house’s grief was too much to put on the shoulders of a young boy. It would have killed Al-Haitham to stay here. And the house would have crumbled under Al-Haitham’s. They would have never survived one another. They would be locked in a mutual cycle of longing and hurting.</p><p>“You can’t go on like this,” Kaveh says as the house clings to Al-Haitham’s wasting. “You did—you did the right thing, then. It was cruel and it was harsh. But it was what you needed to do to survive. It was what Al-Haitham needed to have a chance of surviving. But you can’t hold onto this. Al-Haitham is not that young boy anymore. It won’t kill him. He’s strong. He’s stronger than you can imagine. But—“</p><p>Kaveh moves forward into the house, reaching out and touching nothing as the wasting Al-Haitham’s just keep passing through.</p><p>“But he needs you. He needed you then, and he needs you now. And you need him. You need to share the grief. You need to give him a chance to have the grief move through him. You don’t need to be afraid of him.”</p><p>Kaveh reaches into his pocket and pulls out a photograph.</p><p>It’s a photograph of himself and Al-Haitham that Collei took of them. They were standing side by side, their backs to the kamera. Al-Haitham’s arms were crossed and his head tipped to the side as he watched Senior Faruzan teaching Nilou one of the dances she remembered from her time. The two of them are slightly out of focus blobs of color visible in the gap between Al-Haitham and Kaveh’s bodies. Kaveh leaned against him, his elbow on Al-Haitham’s shoulder, the other hand captured mid-gesture. Kaveh doesn’t remember what they were talking about. But it wasn’t an argument, that much is sure. Al-Haitham stands tall, back straight, shoulders broad. Sure as sunrise. Their faces are turned towards each other just enough that Collei caught a corner of Al-Haitham’s upturned smile.</p><p>“It may be hypocritical of me to be lecturing you on this, when I’ve spent so much time doing the same or something similar as you. But I’ve recently come to some bitter realizations on the topic. As long as you leave the grief to fester it will always be a danger. Perhaps, as he was a child, it was the right move to push him out of immediate harm’s way. But look at him. He is not a boy any longer. And he has gone his entire life disconnected from what is rightfully his: pain and grief and all.”</p><p>Kaveh walks back into the kitchen as the echoes continue to flow in and out in a continuous stream of grief. He places it right on the table where the echoes of untouched fruit sit.</p><p>All around him the house begins to weep. From far it sounds like it begins to rain even though Kaveh knows the sky is clear blue and bright for leagues all around. Water moves through the pipes in the sound of guttural groans, and the house’s beams start to creak and shiver. The darkness reaches out through the moving echoes. When Kaveh looks up that distorted mimicry of a face is looking down upon the photograph, the holes and sockets of its features pouring out its sorrow.</p><p>Kaveh reaches out and places his hand on the table as close to it as he can stand to reach. The air close to it is razor sharp with cold. It feels like reaching through broken glass, for all that his skin is unmarked.</p><p>“It will not be the same as it was then. Share your grief with each other while you can, before it’s too late. I will come back with Al-Haitham in three days. The choice as it was then is yours now. You chose Al-Haitham once. I hope you can choose him again.</p><p>As Kaveh walks away the house dissolves into its echoes, its shadows, is wailing. Its enormous and cavernous wanting. </p><p>-</p><p>Exactly three days later, Al-Haitham and Kaveh stand before the gate covered in jasmine side by side. But this time it is Al-Haitham holding the key. It is Al-Haitham who raises his hand and presses it to the well worn wood of the front gate.</p><p>Kaveh knows what he hopes the house chose. But he has no way of knowing if the house chose it until this moment. </p><p>Al-Haitham presses his hand against the wood and pushes. For a moment nothing happens, Kaveh, next to Al-Haitham turns to see and catches the briefest moment of resignation and disappointment cross Al-Haitham’s face, already smoothing out as it’s let go. Just another thing Al-Haitham’s used to.</p><p>But then the gate opens. It swings open, leaving Al-Haitham’s hand entirely as both of the heavy wooden gates swing open fully to reveal that which it has hidden from the man for years.</p><p>Al-Haitham blinks, turning to Kaveh, as though he needs the confirmation that it actually moved.</p><p>Kaveh puts his hand on Al-Haitham’s shoulder and gives him a gentle push forward, “Well? What are you waiting for? An engraved invitation? Go home, Al-Haitham.”</p><p>And because Al-Haitham can’t back down from a challenge the man turns forward and steps across the threshold.</p><p>The moment he does Kaveh watches as, even from the other side, the entire property comes to life. Kaveh follows after Al-Haitham, but doesn’t go further than he does. When he looks, Al-Haitham’s face has broken into such open and raw wonder, longing, that Kaveh has to turn away from it. It shines out from Al-Haitham’s face, making him look so young. As though he’s gone back in time. Al-Haitham’s face turns up towards the house that rises up before them and he goes very still. Like just looking at the exterior is enough to fill his prodigious mind to the point of stillness.</p><p>But there’s more to a house than its walls.</p><p>Kaveh reaches out and takes Al-Haitham by the hand, giving a firm pull to draw Al-Haitham out of his awe. Al-Haitham blinks, shaking himself as he lowers his eyes to look around. As Al-Haitham moves forward, hand tightly locked with Kaveh’s, the courtyard revives. Al-Haitham’s head keeps turning, eyes wide, entirely silent as he takes it all in. Dazed. Dazzled. Distracted by everything on the other side of the jasmine fence that had blocked his view this entire time.</p><p>As Al-Haitham walks, as his eyes move, it seems that everything he touches or glances upon comes alive just for him. The grass straightens up, each blade textbook perfect and neat. The very trees seem to straighten out of their stooped and defeated curves. The pond clears until the white stones at the bottom gleam like opals. The jasmine begins to bloom, one star of pale pink-white at a time. A bird, in the distance, starts to trill.</p><p>Then, somehow, without either of them realizing it, they are standing shoulder to shoulder in front of the front door. The silver key glitters in Al-Haitham’s hand. Kaveh waits for him to open the door—because the house let them get this far, its definitely going to open. But Al-Haitham doesn’t move and the door doesn’t open. Kaveh glances down and Al-Haitham is looking at the key, the lock. His brow is furrowed, his mouth a line. He looks deep in thought. Kaveh opens his mouth to say something before his eyes catch on movement.</p><p>Al-Haitham’s hands are shaking.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Kaveh watches the fine tremor that moves through Al-Haitham’s hand as he holds the key and he watches the incongruous stillness of Al-Haitham’s face. A facade. Just like Kaveh’s. <em>Ah. Here it is,</em> Kaveh realizes.<em> It was here all along, waiting. And now it has caught up.</em></p><p>Al-Haitham’s hands are shaking just enough that he can’t put the key into the lock.</p><p>So Kaveh steps in next to Al-Haitham, and covers the man’s hands with his own. Kaveh’s hands are steady. No matter how rattled and shaken Kaveh, himself, is, they have never failed to hold true to whatever course he set.</p><p>“Come on now,” Kaveh says, leaning his chin over Al-Haitham’s shoulder, “what have you to be afraid of, Haravatat? What junior of mine has anything to be afraid of from a door? Didn’t you face down eremite zealots intent on human sacrifice, and traitors to the state and God Herself?” Kaveh’s voice is not as steady as his hands, nor is the slight exhale of a laugh the words knock out of Al-Haitham’s mouth.</p><p>Gently, firmly, Kaveh guides their hands to place the key into the lock. And it only takes the slightest turn of their hands before the house takes care of the rest. The house turns the key in the lock, the door clicks, and without them even touching it, it swings open.</p><p>It swings open and it is as though all of the light around them makes a bee-line straight into the house, illuminating the floorboards until they shine, coaxing them in.</p><p>Al-Haitham stands there at that second threshold, so quiet and so still. Kaveh can feel how stiffly he’s holding himself. The last time Al-Haitham saw this door, it was closing behind him as he walked out of this house for the last time. Not knowing it would be the last time.</p><p>Their hands are still entwined. So Kaveh uses that to nudge Al-Haitham forward, into stepping into the entryway. Al-Haitham moves mechanically, reaching down to take off his boots. His hand is a death grip on Kaveh’s as he leans on Kaveh to balance.</p><p>When they take the first step into the house properly the floor is warm underneath their feet. Sun-soaked. Everything is clean and clear. In the distance they can hear a fountain bubbling. There is the faint smell of jasmine from outside, and from somewhere in the house, another smell of incense, slowly permeating hallway-by-hallway. </p><p>Al-Haitham stands in the middle of that entry room in his somber black, looking around like a lost ghost. But an eager one. Al-Haitham just looks around, looking and looking, as though he can’t believe it. Like he’s walking through a dream.</p><p>Kaveh moves to let him go, to wait outside and give Al-Haitham the privacy of the moment to recover what was once lost, but before Kaveh can get far Al-Haitham’s hand moves with the speed of the bird he’s named after. His grip is just as crushing as he clings to Kaveh’s wrist. Al-Haitham’s blazing eyes turn onto Kaveh with a silent demand and an amount of alarm that Kaveh didn’t think unflappable Al-Haitham was even capable of experiencing.</p><p>Kaveh reaches down, prying Al-Haitham’s fingers from his wrist so he can slot their hands together in a much more comfortable manner. As soon as he’s done that Al-Haitham’s off like a shot, pulling Kaveh along with him. The house unfolds before them both, all light, all warmth. Kaveh wishes that he brought Mehrak for this, she could finally complete her floor plans of this place. </p><p>Al-Haitham starts off walking, and then his strides quicken and lengthen until he’s running, cape flaring out behind himself as he pulls Kaveh along. Down hallways and up a flight of stairs. Kaveh wonders how much of this is some residual muscle memory that had been lying dormant in Al-Haitham’s mind and how much of it is the house racing to catch up with him.</p><p>They fly down hallways of light, until Al-Haitham skids to a stop in front of a door, reaching out, fingertips barely brushing the handle before the door swings open with a smooth, graceful, silent motion.</p><p>Over Al-Haitham’s shoulder, Kaveh catches the glimpse of a figure sitting up in bed, and he hears, “<em>Ghaiba, Haitham?</em>” And then the echo is gone.</p><p>Al-Haitham’s shoulders shake as he breathes out, catching his breath after the sprint. His hand falls away from Kaveh’s as he walks into the room as though drawn in by a string. He walks until he is standing over the bed, hands reaching out to press against the blankets, back bowing and shoulders breaking. Al-Haitham slowly sinks to the floor, forehead and arms pressed to the bed.</p><p>“I am sorry to have kept you waiting. I am home now, jadda. I am home.” Al-Haitham’s voice is even and clear, but his hands curl into fists as he pulls the blanket towards himself, face burrowing into the fabric. The long, proud lines of Al-Haitham’s body curl up, shrinking down. </p><p>Kaveh doesn’t know if he should stay or go, what Al-Haitham would want him to do. And Al-Haitham is not in a state to speak it. So Kaveh walks into the room, quietly kneeling down next to Al-Haitham on the floor. Kaveh leans forward and rests his cheek on the edge of the bed near Al-Haitham’s shoulder. Kaveh closes his eyes. Even this close Kaveh can’t tell if Al-Haitham is crying. But the grief in him is palpable in the room. Enormous. Kaveh’s amazed Al-Haitham managed to contain so much so unobtrusively.</p><p>It says so much that the first thing Al-Haitham thinks of when he finally returned to his home that it wasn’t to look around and explore (like one might think he would do, seeing as he says he doesn’t remember it), or look at his own room, but to run to his grandmother’s side.</p><p>Al-Haitham doesn’t say a single word after that. Nor does Kaveh. They stay there like that together, in the heavy silence, for a long time.</p><p>-</p><p>Kaveh doesn’t try to mark or estimate how long they stay there kneeling. And then all at once Kaveh is aware of eyes staring at him. Kaveh opens his own and sees that Al-Haitham has turned his face and moved his arms so that he is mirroring Kaveh’s position on the floor. His eyes are clear. Bright. Diamonds fresh out of the mountain, all that fire.</p><p>Al-Haitham slowly moves to hold his hand between them, wordless. Kaveh’s steady hand meets his and together they rise.</p><p>At a much slower pace than before they walk out of the room, Al-Haitham gently closing the door behind himself. As though he could not bear to disrupt the memory that lives inside. Kaveh doesn’t look back. Al-Haitham hesitates, eyes lingering on something within the room just as the door closes. And then he turns and pulls them down the hallway.</p><p>Now that the most immediate need has been addressed, Al-Haitham just has them wander. Or at least, that’s what Kaveh thinks Al-Haitham is doing. Maybe the house is also guiding them, showing them what it wanted Al-Haitham to see, to have, but couldn’t pass on through Kaveh’s hands. Al-Haitham’s eyes rove over shelves of books and trinkets, across walls of portraits. His hands touch against windowsills, looking out into fields of pitaya or the new sprouts of flowers that the house has just begun to grow again. They walk through storage rooms, bedrooms, sitting rooms. They even find an observatory. They find the aviary too, the birds long gone, but a faint echo of them chittering away at the edge of their hearing. They find the room with the storage jars for the ornamental fish. And despite the lack of water and fish, light catches on something to create the rippling patterns upon the walls and ceiling.</p><p>They walked through the hallway where, as a child, Al-Haitham lay out on that quilted blanket and read books. And through the window they saw the pitaya fields. They found copies of the photographs Kaveh’s father took, in picture frames in a bedroom with clothes for a man and a woman and a toddler tucked into its drawers and cabinets. They even found Al-Haitham’s childhood bedroom. There were stars painted onto the ceiling; several children’s books; a pillow that was clumsily sewn into the shape of a fish with an awkward looking smile and beady eyes; and a picture of Al-Haitham’s grandmother. Al-Haitham slipped the picture out of its frame, tucking it into his pocket.</p><p>The entire time, Al-Haitham’s hand remains in Kaveh’s, the two of them never straying far from each other. Kaveh keeps the silence with Al-Haitham the entire time.</p><p>They come to a stop in the central courtyard. The kitchen is behind them and the wings of the house hold them close. When they were inside the house it felt like morning stretched out infinitely. They were walking through time in a way that defied time itself. But now, outside, time has not quite restarted but shifted them into a new scene. Afternoon and dusk have joined hands.</p><p>Now they are sitting on a raised wooden platform, probably used to dry fruits and vegetables, or maybe just sit and enjoy the outdoors. </p><p>“If I had never approached you about my father’s books,” Kaveh says breaking the silence that had overtaken them since the front door opened, “what would you have done about the house?”</p><p>Al-Haitham’s face is tired. Kaveh can’t imagine what Al-Haitham might possibly be thinking right now. Al-Haitham closes his eyes, face turning towards the sky as he leans back onto his palm.</p><p>“Nothing.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Nothing, Kaveh. Nothing. I told you. Before you, I had already tried. I had accepted the situation as it was. I had done what I could and my efforts were fruitless. So I turned towards handling the situation as it was. I paid my taxes on it. I made sure the paperwork was kept up. I checked on the boundary line every few months to make sure there were no obvious signs of disruption. And I looked at it from afar.”</p><p>“That’s it? You would have been content with that?”</p><p>“I had hoped,” Al-Haitham admits. “I’m not entirely as pragmatic as you would think I am. As unreasonable as it is, despite all the prior evidence that suggested that the hope would never bear fruition—I am a man as any other. I, too, wanted. Dreamed.”</p><p>Al-Haitham’s voice hits upon that strange timbre where it is not quite soft, but it certainly isn’t sharp. It’s something in between. Bruised, maybe.</p><p>“It was enough to have it in that way. To know, loosely, that we were still connected even if it was just on paper, through our history. Even if it would deny me and avoid me, then at least I could just be there in that capacity. It would have to be enough because there was no way past the wall, past the boundary that had been established. And I wasn’t going to force myself where I was not wanted.”</p><p>Kaveh watches Al-Haitham’s face as he speaks, another realization walking out of the shadows as dusk emerges. There’s a resigned fondness to Al-Haitham’s mouth. It makes him look soft. It makes him look exactly his age and thus out of place in this house that’s like a snapshot out of every century past and yet also every house to ever exist in the history of life in Sumeru.</p><p>“But I would sometimes look and wonder,” Al-Haitham continues with that bruised softness. “Perhaps. Maybe. Who knows? Perhaps one day the door will open to me. And it would not be at all like I imagined. But it would be what it is and I would accept it in whatever form that was. I didn’t exactly have real expectations. Just hopes. Whatever came of them, I would make it enough.”</p><p>“How unlike you,” Kaveh says, throat growing tight as understanding rushes through his veins, “to be so passive.”</p><p>“And what could I do when I was so clearly unwelcome?”</p><p>“Unwelcome, but not unwanted.”</p><p>Al-Haitham opens his eyes, head turning, lolling, to face Kaveh. The fading light of dusk catches on the copper rings in Al-Haitham’s eyes. Al-Haitham’s mouth is fully curved up, sardonic as he asks with his usual sharpness that always cuts right down to the bone, “And how was I to know the difference?”</p><p>Kaveh is entirely sure that they are not talking about the house anymore. Or at least, Kaveh isn’t. Kaveh turns a little, so that more of himself is facing Al-Haitham, leaning his own weight onto his palms.</p><p>“You could have asked.”</p><p>“Could I?”</p><p>What an improbable series of dawns and dusks that has come over Kaveh in such short order. </p><p>As Kaveh prepares to answer Al-Haitham with “Yes, why wouldn’t you? Who in the world could possibly stop <em>you</em> from doing something you put your mind to?” He realizes—</p><p>They’ve never really talked before. Have they? He and Al-Haitham? They’ve never really had a conversation. As people. As Kaveh and Al-Haitham, at least, not until very recently.</p><p>As students they debated with each other. Every word out of their mouths towards the other was a gauntlet thrown down, a challenge to rise up to. They were nothing but debates, discussions, inquisitions and inquiries. And all of this was outward. They never questioned each other about themselves. It was always about some other topic, some other question that wasn’t about either of them except their own talents and potential to prove the impossible or crack the uncrackable.</p><p>For all that it seemed like they knew each other like the back of each other’s hands, that was all they knew. They knew nothing of the palm, the inside. They did not talk about themselves. They told each other nothing of who they were and so they just observed each other. They made their own conclusions based on the parts of each other that they saw but did not question. And that was how it fell apart—that thin version of Kaveh and Al-Haitham that was made only by observation. There was so much of it that was true, real, accurate. But the essential parts that would have held it up—</p><p>Under pressure, the assumption proved itself for what it was. Illusion.</p><p>Then when they were older, they only knew each other on paper. At a distance. All of their exchanges were about other people’s work and research and aimed at proving the other wrong. They learned about each other, yes. You always learn something about a person when you argue with them. But this was also just observation and assumption, conclusions drawn from letters on a page. And quite frankly, sometimes Kaveh purposefully stood on the other side of Al-Haitham just because he could. </p><p>And when they moved in together, after all those years of physical separation where paper served as their proxy, did they talk to each other? No. They <em>told</em> each other things. Facts. </p><p>Here is the garbage date for recyclables. This is the date the water is going to be off for the district. There’s some bitter gourd going bad in the pantry. The bread has gone stale. There’s a package for you in the front room. Your laundry is finished. I’m going out for a few days. We are out of coffee.</p><p>Just like how the Akasha would tell people things. </p><p>They would only say things that didn’t require them to think, to connect. And they would not question it and they would move on, using those simple building blocks that didn’t require them to comment or think to find a neutral ground.</p><p>They did not communicate. They talked <em>at</em> each other and they talked <em>around</em> each other.</p><p>Even for most of this process of restoration that they mutually agreed on, they were not talking. They were telling. And telling and hearing is not the same as talking and listening. </p><p>It was only recently, very recently, that they began to talk again. Like that afternoon when Kaveh was drawing impossible houses and Al-Haitham was reading his silly but terrible junk food literature. Or all those other times when Kaveh would ask Al-Haitham about the process of his work, and Al-Haitham would ask Kaveh about his current clients. Those moments. <em>Those</em> were conversations.</p><p><em>This</em> is a conversation. And it is one long, long, long overdue.</p><p>“No,” Kaveh admits, “Before you couldn’t. But now—now you can.”</p><p>“Could I?” Al-Haitham repeats.</p><p>“Did I stutter? Look.” Kaveh sits up. “Haven’t we been talking? Truly, finally, getting to know each other these past months? The us of now, rather than the images of us we’ve carried from before? Before we learned each other through observation, through test and trail and challenge. But before we never talked like this. We never talked of ourselves. Everything we knew of each other was guesswork that we assumed based on extrapolation and inference. But we never verified any of it. We’re so different, for all that we share so many things in common with each other. We’re opposites to the point of almost coming around full circle. Sometimes when we talk you say things and I don’t understand them despite the fact that we’re speaking the same language. Sometimes when we talk we both walk away with completely different take-aways that has nothing to do with our opinions but entirely our perceptions—and we think, as we walk away, that we both heard and said the exact same things but we really didn’t.”</p><p>Behind them, the lights of the house start to flicker on, one by one, adding their own variations of light to the dusk. Al-Haitham’s brow is furrowed as he takes in what Kaveh is saying.</p><p>“But now,” Kaveh says, sitting up and leaning forward, “now we’ve actually been talking. You say something and I admit I don’t understand it and you attempt to clarify it. And vice versa. We don’t always get it right and we’re both prone to bad habits when it comes to each other—our histories make it too easy for us to slip into them. But we’re also mature enough to sometimes attempt to put aside our pride and our certainty and check that we’re on the level with each other. Like normal people do. The problem is that we don’t do that enough. We lose each other to ourselves and the easy assumptions we’ve been making that are sometimes cataclysmically wrong, and shoot ourselves in the foot, ruining our own progress.”</p><p>Predictably, Al-Haitham proves Kaveh’s point by immediately saying, “We’re not normal people. Or at least, you aren't. Light of the Kshahrewar.” Although he looks incredibly bemused as he says it. The lights from the house behind them, around them, begin to reach them.</p><p>“You know <em>exactly</em> what I mean and now you’re pretending like you don’t just to have me on,” Kaveh scowls. Or tries to. He knows the corners of his mouth betray him. </p><p>“With me,” Kaveh says to return them to that earlier question, “<em>you are wanted</em>. I often do not understand you, and just as often I do not agree with you. Sometimes you are the last person I want to see or hear, but more often than that you are one of the first I think of anyway.” Kaveh swallows, willing himself not to look away. “I don’t regret you. I regret, sometimes, the things we do to each other. When we are together and in harmony we can do impossible things. Wondrous things. When things go well between us we are as matching hands. Of course, in proportional converse, when we fall out of that lock-step and go wrong, we go cataclysmically off the rails. Which hurts all the more because of the memory of the unity. It’s because we’re both so—well. <em>Us</em>. But I have never once truly regretted you.”</p><p>Al-Haitham slowly sits up, turning to face Kaveh fully, drawing his legs and underneath himself on the wooden platform. His eyes catch all the lights of the house for his own purpose.</p><p>“Then at least, on this one thing, it is safe to say that we are both in alignment and agreement,” he says. There is the beginning of a smile starting at his eyes. But it’s lined with that familiar tiredness. Kaveh’s heart pangs as past attempts to cloud the present. “Shall we talk then, Kaveh, as normal people do? Is that what we are to do in order to finally find each other again and be done with this tiresome back and forth that causes us to lose our ground and have to start over again?”</p><p>“Are you opening negotiations?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Then yes. Let’s try this business of actually talking to each other out and see if we can make that a habit that sticks. We’ve done stranger things in our lives. We’ve done stranger things in the last year, even.”</p><p>“And what should we speak on?”</p><p>Kaveh turns towards the house, eyes moving along the lit up windows. There is a music player in one of those rooms, it’s started up now. It’s an old thing, the sound grainy and warbling. The air is jasmine. Fireflies begin to glimmer as they float in. Crickets chirr. A frog starts up a monologue.</p><p>“You’ve got your house back,” Kaveh says. “What will you do with two houses?”</p><p>“I’ve <em>always</em> had two houses.” Kaveh, without looking, reaches out and shoves Al-Haitham’s shoulder. Al-Haitham shoves back. “I don’t see why anything has to change about that. Aren’t country houses and city houses meant to be paired, anyway?”</p><p>Kaveh sputters, eyes widening as he turns towards Al-Haitham, Kshahrewar mind perfunctorily kicking Kaveh away from the controls of the mouth to take over. “Are you quite serious? They look nothing alike! And the difference in materials and age is going to be <em>horrendous</em> to work around. You’d have to put real work into it, you know! Pairing two houses that are so disparate in nature and origin that takes an age—and the <em>paperwork</em>, I thought you hated paperwork? I’m not even talking about what you’ll have to do to get the houses themselves to recognize it as a true pairing. For all you know they might not even like each other or be interested in being matched. Archons, and if it does somehow manage to start to stick then your house in the city—“</p><p>“Our house in the city,” Al-Haitham interjects.</p><p>Kaveh’s mouth clicks shut. Al-Haitham rolls his eyes, reaching forward and poking Kaveh between the eyebrows. “There’s no point in calling it anything other than what it is. It’s <em>our</em> house. It was made because of us. We’re the only ones who’ve ever lived in it. And it only started to behave the way it does because we both live there. It wouldn’t be doing the things it does if it was just me or just you. And you know it, Kshahrewar.”</p><p>“<em>Our</em> house in the city,” Kaveh manages to get out without stammering, even though he feels himself going quite red in the face and shoulders, “is really going to start in with the growing pains of a house that’s starting to fully rouse to wakefulness. It’s quite different with an established house like this one here. It’s mature. It’ll be like having a toddler.” Kaveh bursts out laughing. “Al-Haitham, in the span of a few months we’ve gone from being roommates to people raising the equivalent of a toddler together with a whole lot of ineffable nonsense in between. We have literally, in just the last minute, determined that one of the main issues we have is a breakdown in communications. And now we’re discussing the feasibility of a binding houses. I can’t tell if we’re going too fast or are somehow entirely on track for, well. Us.”</p><p>“So it <em>can</em> be done,” Al-Haitham concludes, nodding to himself in satisfaction.</p><p>"It would be different, Al-Haitham," Kaveh warns him. "It's not something that can be done so lightly."</p><p>"Nor was I implying it was."</p><p>"It's a choice," Kaveh says. "It's not going to be like how it is now. The way things have been, the going back and forth and such. In a way we've already started the process when I was convincing this house to open itself to you, with the exchanging of items between the two properties and the meshing of their styles and their atmospheres. But the intent does matter. If we go into this with intent..."</p><p>"What you mean is, we would have to speak it," Al-Haitham translates, "we cannot hide behind obscurity, behind assumption. It must be explicit. In the ways we've just said we must start to be. Intentional without the shield of obfuscation and interpretation."</p><p>“Yes. Everything about us seems to come back to that. It will be work. It's not just an invesment of mora, but it's an investment in time and energies. It cannot be incicental,” Kaveh warns him. “We’d have to split our time to make sure both houses get time with us. And it’s not something that can be abandoned halfway. We have to want it. Choose it. Actively pursue it. We have to work for it and commit to it no matter how ugly it gets.”</p><p>“Good. Maybe that will deter people from trying to find me after hours,” Al-Haitham says. “Besides, since when did either of us shy from work? Or from the unpleasant? Especially when it comes to each other.” Al-Haitham’s clear eyes smile, and so does his mouth. “So to be clear, we are in agreement? We are going to do this?”</p><p>“The houses will have to talk to each other for a while. Get over their own language barriers and start to—well. Converse. But yes. It can be done with time, with patience, with care. Just as anything else can be accomplished. Al-Haitham. If we do this—we’ll never be rid of each other. You know that, right? This house will always be your house, but our house in Sumeru City…there will be no more walking out on each other after that. No matter how awful we get.”</p><p>Al-Haitham is already shaking his head before Kaveh can finish speaking.</p><p>“Of course we’re going to walk out on each other,” Al-Haitham says, Kaveh frowns, the sting jolting against the atmosphere that had settled upon them. But Al-Haitham continues calmly, factually, as matter-of-factly as if he were talking about their grocery list or bills due. “This is not, inherently, a bad thing—the leaving. Sometimes leaving each other is what we need for our own health and our own development. It is not a matter of our ability to walk <em>out</em> on each other, but rather our ability to walk <em>back</em> <em>into</em> each other’s lives.” Al-Haitham returns Kaveh’s words to him. “<em>You are wanted in my life,</em> <em>Kaveh</em>. And mostly welcomed, too. Thus, what becomes important is not whether or not we choose to walk away from each other—because we will. You’re frowning but you know we will. Perhaps it will be amenable or perhaps it is not. Although I have my hopes that any parting of ways between us is the former, that’s not the point.”</p><p>“Then <em>what is,</em> because I’m going to tell you—from my side you’re just ruining the mood. It was quite pleasant until you started in on the pessimism.”</p><p>Al-Haitham sighs, rolling his eyes.</p><p>“The point is the <em>return</em>, Kaveh. As you said, it's the choice. The intent. Choosing to return and knowing that there is a place to return to. That for all the silence that may come between us, there is nothing to stop us from talking as we do now. It is the knowing that even if we walk out, the door will remain and it will open so long as we keep the key.”</p><p>Between them, in Al-Haitham’s palm, the silver key glitters up at them both.</p><p>Kaveh looks to the key, and then to Al-Haitham, and everything both mean.</p><p>I regret you; I should know better when it comes to you; something torn apart that can never be put back to how it was; fury that builds and builds and washes over like a wave; the same twist of pain reflected in a face that is at once familiar and a stranger; the savagery; years upon years upon years of silence broken by words thrown across each other through paper proxies that barely managed to make them civil; the razed and still smoldering earth of so much being ripped out by the root; the one building that he put so much of himself into but never allowed the touch of his own name; the feeling of being cut down to the very bone and flayed open and judged as wanting.</p><p>And also—</p><p>Dal; the uneven split of raita; a shoulder pressed against his own as two sets of hands flip between different pages in the same book and point at different sections, voices talking over each other and with each other as the same sentence twists and turns between their mouths and minds; rainbow speckles from a glass lotus cast upon rows of books and propped up photographs; two picture frames with ridiculous highlights of their lives; a hand in his own as he tries to push through a wave of emotion so strong it robs him of sight and breath; that smile; the sound of a spin-crystal player; a building that returned everything given despite the fact he had already refused it; a hand offered in the darkest hour; it’s you.</p><p>“I will never be able to repay what you have given me.”</p><p>“The only thing I have ever asked you to pay is rent.”</p><p>“There is a part of me that we both find distasteful, and it will always burn whether I actively feed it or actively fight it. It is something I am going to have to live with and manage for the rest of my life. I know that it will, eventually, escape my control just long enough for it to gain more fuel before I can contain it once more.”</p><p>“At least you’re self-aware. And am I not also made of unpalatable sharpness? Am I not also too much bluntness with too little care? It is only something that I have recently learned to turn aside. I have only recently begun to learn when and how to temper this edge I as not fully aware of. But it is not something that I will ever be able to set aside entirely. It is not something I am always capable of recognizing before the injury is dealt.”</p><p>“Although I can now see some of the merits to your self-centric egoism, I cannot fully bring myself to concede to your philosophies and methods to being right. They aren’t.”</p><p>“You often say I like a challenge. You aren’t wrong. In any case, if you ever <em>did</em> fully concede to me you would not be you any longer. I, too, cannot fully deny your ideals. For all that they have cost you, they are still part of you. And for all of the misery they’ve brought you, I’m not so biased as to completely disregard the good. I maintain that your ideals are not sustainable nor are they feasible, but I can no longer honestly say that they are entirely flawed and fruitless.”</p><p>“I am absolutely going to be bringing the teeth cup here. I might even go back to see if I can get a second one so I don’t have to move it back and forth and risk it getting damaged or misplaced.”</p><p>“I hope the first thing the houses learn is to misplace that cup and that you reflect upon yourself whenever you call me out for having poor aesthetic sense.”</p><p>“Even still…?”</p><p>“Did you think I did not know these things about you? I knew these things the first time I gave you a key. Clearly it didn’t stop me. As you said Kaveh, it’s work. It’s uncertain work that both of us are going to be going through for as long as we live. The work of change and growth is thankless and unending. But this is the path that I choose. I’ll take the chance. If I am wrong about it, then so be it. I carry my consequences. To put it shortly: it’s hope.”</p><p>“Then I will carry them with you. If this is the choice you’ve made then how could I do anything less?” Kaveh places his hand over Al-Haitham’s, the key warm between their palms. “If there is work to be done then I will do it. If there is a consequence to bear, I will bear it. But if there is a chance to be found at something better than this, then I will surely seize upon it. And if there is hope for us yet, I’ll choose it. Yes, Al-Haitham. Let us take these houses and all that they entail and see if, with all of our history and our potential, we can make a home.”</p>
