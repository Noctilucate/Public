<p>Al-Haitham is restless. Energy without appropriate outlet crawls over and through his skin like some infestation that he cannot ease, cannot purge, cannot silence. He is uneasy and agitated with his inability to soothe himself, command himself. It is not like him to be so out of control. It is not like him to be unsettled by his own self. He is not himself at all, except he must be because what <em>else</em> could he be aside from himself?</p><p>He has spent the better part of what was otherwise a perfectly decent day observing this rise in hapless energy within himself build upon itself, unable to do anything to circumvent it, and feeling all the more irritable for it. This bout of energy could not have come while he was in the middle of his official work hours? It had to wait for <em>now</em>? If it had waited about half a day he would be able to do something about this in his office and get <em>paid</em> for it.</p><p>Al-Haitham has been pacing the hallways of the house like some particularly agitated animal in a cage. He feels like one, too. The cage being his own body, his own mind. If anyone saw him right now they would be shocked -- concerned, perhaps. This is very much unlike himself. </p><p>If Kaveh were here he’d snap at Al-Haitham to sit down and be still, he’s pacing a groove into the floor, and making Kaveh feel restless by proxy besides that, so what’s wrong?</p><p>But Kaveh is not here, and Al-Haitham is aware enough of his own shortened temper and unsettled mood to be grateful for it. A fight is not what he needs right now, although it would be a diversion from this uselessness. </p><p>It has always been, that between the two of them, Al-Haitham is the one with the more spare time to use as he will. Al-Haitham’s work has always been contained onto itself. Al-Haitham has adhered to his posted office hours with the strict devotion most would reserve for religion. The past few months are the exception to this that he hopes to never repeat, ever.</p><p>Despite returning to his official posting as Scribe of the Akademiya and happily leaving behind the office of Acting Grand Sage (but not the salary), the changes of the last few months have had their lingering effects on him that he has yet to shake. Al-Haitham is no longer used to idleness, for all that he has missed for it and worked to regain it. It feels wrong to have nothing to do. With all of his time spent on reconstruction, the preceding revolution, and before that, the research that led him onto the unlikely path that ran against the current of the Akademiya’s previous ruling body, Al-Haitham has had no time for any personal pursuits. And now he is not used to the idleness. Before all of this, Al-Haitham could easily spend an afternoon such as this one napping or latching onto book after book or simply watching clouds pass. </p><p>Kaveh has always envied him this ability to stop and be still and content with his own mind as company, at the same time he has appreciated it and drawn his own comfort from Al-Haitham’s steadiness. Where is that steadiness now, though?</p><p><em>Now</em>, after all of this business of work and responsibility and culpability, Al-Haitham’s body and mind are used to things that yield a result of some form. And the idea of doing any of those other, <em>more leisurely</em>, things has him feeling like the time is wasted. Even more so than just pacing like this. It feels like he is being timed, observed, measured and calculated, and every moment spent not doing something is a mark against him. This a poor habit that he’s picked up from his expanded social circle — one that he wishes to break. He has surrounded himself with too many people who take responsibility and duty too seriously. Kaveh was bad enough, but now he’s swept up into the flow of Lord Kusanali, Dehya, and Cyno’s businesses, and more peripherally, Tighnari and Candace, and even further out from that, Layla and Nilou. Not a single one among the lot knows what it means to relax and take the day as it is. </p><p>He supposes he can forgive Layla for it, he isn’t so far removed from his own time as an undergraduate that he’s forgotten what it was like. But the rest of them have no excuses.</p><p>Al-Haitham did not work this hard for the past few months just to do <em>more</em> <em>work</em> in his off hours and not get paid for it. He fought for this free time to spend as his own to do as he pleases.</p><p>The part of him that has been made particularly snappish and petty with his growing discomfort hopes that he has affected <em>them</em> in a similar way with his usual much more temperate and laid-back nature.</p><p>(His last day off was spent with Dehya, picking out books for the orphanage that she has quietly begun sponsoring. He remembers pointing out to her that he’s not necessarily the best candidate for this sort of thing. But of their circle, Dehya said she trusted no one else with this. Of all of the people she knew, he was the one who knew the most about books. </p><p>And — “I’ve seen you with Paimon and some of the village kids. You’re a good teacher with them. You know what you’re doing. You’re an unexpectedly soft touch, aren’t you?”</p><p>Dehya would perhaps be the first and <em>only</em> person to say such a thing. At least, she would be the only one to say so directly to his face with such an easy expression.</p><p>He remembers that after making their selection of books they were walking through one of Sumeru City’s numerous gardens and pavilions to place a bulk order for writing supplies. He slowed down to observe some crystal flies that had wandered into one of the pergolas, gently floating close to each other and somehow not driven off by the noise of the city. Dehya waited for him at the other end of the row of pergolas and once he caught up with her she gave him a strangely sharp look, the sort she used when she was observing something unexpected and that she thought she probably should have already anticipated. He’s seen her give this look to the occasional sparring partner, but more recently, towards Layla and the Traveler.</p><p>“I did not think you the type of man to stop and smell the literal flowers,” she said as they resumed walking. Al-Haitham shrugged. Why not? They were there after all. Besides — “If one is to study something, one must first understand what they are studying.”</p><p>Dehya nodded, mouth pulling up into a grin as she lightly nudged his covered shoulder with her elbow — careful and observant of his reaction, and when he did not give her one, she bumped her shoulder more firmly against his. After a moment he bumped her back and her smile grew to show teeth as her eyes curved to reflect her laughter.)</p><p>And <em>where</em> has this nature gone?</p><p>Al-Haitham cannot bring himself to do anything. He cannot focus on any of the books he’s been trying to set aside time for. Every attempt has his eyes sliding right off the page, the rest of his body thrumming like a string too tight, wanting for action, for purpose. He could cook, he could bake — but what? And for who? Al-Haitham can only eat so much. And it would be a waste of ingredients to have so many leftovers that will remain untouched, more so now that Kaveh is rarely here and often occupied elsewhere.</p><p>He could exercise. He could clean. He could organize his shelves again. But every time he moves to try any of these things his body reacts with a visceral rejection of the act, unsatisfied and growing even more displeased with every wrong answer. And with every rejection his patience and his temper wears ever thinner. It’s all animal is the problem, a problem with the baser instinct going wrong that he cannot untangle and resolve with logic.</p><p>He remembers moments like this when he was much younger — these bouts of energy with nowhere to go that made him feel like an intruder into his own body, like an unwanted leash around a wild animal, a tack to an untamed and furious horse, the muzzle on a feral dog. But it’s been a very long time since he was that child and the sudden return of this uncontrollable wildness has him off his guard. For the life of him he can’t seem to recall how he resolved this then. Perhaps he just rode it out like he’s trying to do now. But as a grown man there is more danger within him and the loss of his control than there was as a child.</p><p>He could leave. He could walk out of the house and do something — take up a commission at the Adventurer’s Guild, or simply go beyond Sumeru’s walls to seek out something that manages to soothe the discord of mind and body. But the body and mind reject these options with even more vitriolic revulsion. </p><p>Kaveh has often called him a contrary thing, a man of paradoxes. This is usually said with some measure of frustration or exasperation, or both, and only rarely with a softer veneer of fondness. Al-Haitham will admit this to being true only some of the time, he’s self-aware enough to understand his own peculiarities. Unfortunately, one of those times is right now.</p><p>He cannot stay here, in this house. The walls feel like they’re too dark, too imposing, too much — almost, but<em> not quite</em> claustrophobic. If it could commit to one or the other he would be grateful. While part of him wants to leave, there is another part of him that cannot leave it. Not right now. Perhaps if he left earlier, before his unraveling control got this poor he would have been capable of it. Currently, at the thought of walking among the crowds of Sumeru City, of the noise, the smells, the inadvertent touch, a shudder moves through him so violently that he feels himself gag and momentarily choke on it. Even here, in the isolation and shelter of the house, the sound of his own breathing is oppressive to him. If he could stand the constant touch and weight of his earphones and their cord over his neck and shoulder, he would have put them on by now. And the thought of wide openness of Sumeru’s hills and the upward length of the giant trees that pierce the sky almost has him on his knees with spots across his vision. </p><p>He has changed into the loosest, most comfortable clothing he owns, unfit for being seen in public even for him, he who normally doesn’t care about appearances or perceptions. And it is not enough. The weight and touch of fabric against his skin makes him want to scratch and claw. It’s like his nerves and his bones are alive with the need to escape the softer flesh. He has become a hive for his own bones, a shell, a cocoon. </p><p>His day had started with this, this grating against nerves and patience by everything: lights, sounds, touch, smells.  </p><p>And in the middle of struggling to tame this, to tame himself, he felt the first wave of restlessness hovering at the edge of his shores and could only exist as some hapless piece of driftwood among that perfect storm that seized him from head to foot.</p><p>He’s choking on it. He’s choking on all of it and he doesn’t know what to do about it. And this, <em>this not-knowing</em>, is the part that bothers him the most. If it weren’t for this not-knowing, Al-Haitham is firmly convinced he would not be as badly off as he currently feels and must look to any potential spying eyes. He is of the belief that anything could be made bearable if it was <em>known</em>. If something is known it could be broken apart, broken down, deconstructed and reformulated into a more tolerable and palatable composition.</p><p>Al-Haitham abruptly turns in the middle of pacing through the front room for the kitchen, and through the kitchen, out into the small strip of land formed by the wings of the house.</p><p>This house was not originally intended to be a house, a residence. It was originally a research center. Al-Haitham had it converted into a house after the fact. But it is close to a residential area of Sumeru; close enough that the occupants of that street have adopted Al-Haitham and Kaveh as their own. </p><p>There is a small strip of paved stone that forms a small courtyard between the wings of the house and the portion of the Divine Tree that the building is settled against. This back area of the house cannot be seen from within the house itself. All of their windows are opaque stained glass. The windows need to be opened to look out into it, but there isn’t anything to look at so they only ever really open the windows when they need the ventilation, and even then, they roll down the netting to prevent bugs and the particularly bold lizard from taking the chance to enter the house.</p><p>One has to purposefully go through the kitchen and out the door there in order to look at this narrow and irregular space. They rarely go out here. They keep their trash here for collection and disposal, for the most part, and sometimes Kaveh will smoke out here if he’s in a particularly poor mood. The space is longer than it is deep. It’s paved with the same stone that forms the platforms and walk-ways of the city, although it’s very dusty and there are weeds sprouting out from between cracks in the stone. Against the wall right next to the door, underneath the closed kitchen window is a pathetic set of shelves that Kaveh built out of spare wood to place a few plants that he had tried to grow.</p><p>Al-Haitham had originally warned Kaveh off of the venture. Neither of them were home enough to care for it. Or at least, Kaveh wasn’t. So why bother? But Kaveh insisted. Al-Haitham told Kaveh that he would not interfere if Kaveh forgot. The plants would simply wither from neglect. Kaveh simply declared that it wouldn’t come to that — he didn’t need the help. Al-Haitham shrugged and let it pass. </p><p>As Al-Haitham grabs a pair of shoes from next to the door to pace in the false-openness of the empty courtyard he takes a glance at the row of plants now. To Kaveh’s credit, he <em>had</em> been taking good care of them. They’d been doing well enough until recently, he supposes, seeing as how they’re only partway dead and not completely withered away. There are a total of three plants and all three of them look pathetic. For all that they live in the land of dendro and in the shelter of the Divine Tree, even these common plants can’t survive on their own without the intervention of another’s hand.</p><p>Al-Haitham paces, mood only slightly shifted with the change in scenery but the restless anxiety within him is still eating away at his nerves. His eye is drawn to the three plants as the only other thing in the courtyard aside from the garbage bins. Eventually he finds his pacing bringing him closer and closer to the wooden shelf, until his feet have stopped right there, his back to the sun, giving the plants some temporary respite.</p><p>He reaches out and takes the dried-brown edge of a mint leaf between his fingers, giving the plant a small trickle of dendro energy. The plant immediately starts to straighten up, looking only slightly less miserable than it did before. It’s a short-term solution to a long-term problem of neglect. It is not malicious neglect in nature. It’s simply that Kaveh is a man. A single man who is bound by the constraints of time, energy, and physics.</p><p>Kaveh is rarely home as it is, and his time and presence has come into even more demand since the Inter-Darshan competition. Although Kaveh is still not charging his full worth, squandering his time and attentions for basically free. If Kaveh just used his actual mastery and reputation properly, Al-Haitham is sure that Kaveh wouldn’t be nearly as inundated as he is now. For all of Kaveh takes pride in his accomplishments and readily acknowledges his own skill, Kaveh continues to market himself like some no-name graduate. Not that Kaveh would listen if Al-Haitham told him this.</p><p>Al-Haitham rubs the leaf between his fingertips, feeling the strange resistance and friction made by leaf and skin. It is not entirely disagreeable in comparison to the rest of everything. He wonders what’s wrong with them, the plants, exactly. For all that he is a dendro-Vision holder he has no real experience or knowledge of plants aside from the extreme basics.</p><p>He does not know how to care for these plants. Do they need more or less water? More or less sun? Are they salvageable? How hardy are these plants and what is the point at which they are lost causes?</p><p>There are books that he’s read about botany, but none of them give him any practical information for this specific situation at hand. All of the information he knows is either too generalized or entirely too specific. And almost every text he’s read has been in regards to plant uses and cultural significance, not their tending and raising. Even if he did have the knowledge of what to do, Al-Haitham does not have any tools to take action. He has no spade, no pruning shears, no extra soil, no extra pots. His ability to do anything in this situation is extremely limited and he is practically blind in this specific field. It is an unusual situation for him to be in. But his mind takes up the challenge with some interest. Here is a problem that Al-Haitham can sink his teeth into. Here is something he can pull at until it unravels.</p><p>He loses time standing there with the sun beating down on his back, his neck. His mind goes quiet, momentarily silenced by the feeling of something living under his hands, the thought of a problem that needs solving. He is not quite satisfied, but he’s on the track towards something more solid than where he was before.</p><p>His skin feels raw when he thinks of touching the dry soil, of feeling the texture of sun-warmed clay beneath his palms. But his mind only turns the idea away partially, not outright discarding it with the finality it has turned away every other course of possible remedy to his current state.</p><p>Al-Haitham sets his jaw. His mind hasn’t rejected the thought, this specific thought of action. While it isn’t ideal, this is the best he’s gotten after an entire day of slowly going mad.</p><p>Lest his mind changes again, Al-Haitham turns around and walks back into the shade of the house. He changes into something slightly more presentable and wraps thought of action and movement around him like a shield, and walks out the front door to talk to Nour Aunt. Of all of their neighbors, he speaks with her the most because she’s the house closest to theirs and because the woman has no fear, respect, or care for any attempt at drawing a boundary. Al-Haitham truly wishes that he could have just brought her to the Akademiya and set her loose upon everyone. It would have saved them them all a lot of work, he’s sure. Cyno might have even deputized her into the Matra’s ranks — Cyno’s comparison to the Great Vayuvyastra would have been in danger.</p><p>Nour Aunt’s house is covered in jasmine and wisteria. It creeps up the walls and the eaves, curling around the shingles of the house, just barely beaten back from the windows by Nour Aunt’s pruning shears. The smell combined with the heat and humidity of the afternoon makes his stomach roil, but he sets his jaw and turns all of his focus onto his current course.</p><p>He’s been into her house and into her back yard a few times. Her green thumb is only exceeded by her remarkable skill with a needle, both of which are somehow unaffected by her absolutely terrible eyesight. Nour Aunt will help. She likes to talk and will leap at any opportunity to tell anyone how to do something properly.</p><p>He raps his knuckles firmly on her front door twice. The feeling of his knuckles striking wood feels like a jolt to raw nerve all the way up to his skull. He sets his teeth against it. She’s home, he can see the faint wisps of smoke from the back where her kitchen is.</p><p>The woman opens the door a few moments later, squinting up at him. </p><p>“Al-Haitham.”</p><p>“Nour Aunt. Afternoon.” He inwardly grimaces at the sound of his own voice, the sound of it strange and wrong to his ears. That should be enough with pleasantries, especially considering the fact that whenever they talk it’s because she’s waved him over to either lecture him or somehow swindle him into carrying home platters of food. “I have questions for you.”</p><p>Nour Aunt squints up at him. The novelty of him willingly seeking her out must be curious enough indeed because she clicks her tongue at him, turning around and gesturing him into the house. Al-Haitham follows after her and takes a seat at her table. </p><p>“You smell of sun,” she says, forgoing tea and coffee to place water with an entire wedge of lemon at the bottom of the already sweating glass that she had been keeping cool and ready for use in her ice-box. “What have you been at now?”</p><p>Al-Haitham drinks the water, surprised at how thirsty he didn’t realize was, and feels the pressure in his head ease the smallest amount, enough that his own voice is not as grating as it was mere moments ago as he dives into explaining the situation of the plants to her. Nour Aunt squints off into the distance, nodding along. He cannot tell if she is more displeased than usual or not, if anything he describes is unusual or alarming. Nour Aunt’s expression is almost perpetually locked into a squinting glare because of her poor vision, mouth pinched down at the corners as she concentrates on bringing the world into clarity. It makes it hard to discern where she stands on any given topic until she begins speaking. </p><p>Again, he thinks that it’s a shame that they couldn’t deputize her at the Akademiya. So much time that could have been saved. So many meetings he could have crossed off of his schedule. So many people who would have shut up to never be heard from again.</p><p>As he speaks, she leaves to her own back yard, keeping the door open. He follows her to the doorway, answering her questions as she goes around gathering up tools that she puts into a basket. The effort to continue speaking and to continue listening wears at him, shortening his answers. Thankfully she does not ask much from him, perhaps she doesn’t expect anything more from him. Instead, she shoves the basket of tools into his arms.</p><p>“I need to look at what I’m working with. You paint a good picture, but I have to wonder if you know what exactly you’re speaking of,” she tells him, then leads him right out her front door and back to his own house. He trails after her, feeling somewhat like foolish for it, but recognizing that she’s the senior authority here and it would be easier to just go along with it. After all, he is the one who called after her for the help. And if he doesn’t have to speak, all the better.</p><p>Upon entering the courtyard she wrinkles her nose, shaking her head as she sighs before she starts scolding him over letting it get this bad. Al-Haitham holds his tongue about how these are Kaveh’s, because he doubts it would matter to her one way or another. He’s sure that she’d somehow find more to criticize him over, somehow. Kaveh’s certainly told him of the many times that Nour Aunt has taken him to task over Al-Haitham’s perceived wrongs, as though they share them by proximity to each other, as though they were some sort of unit.<em> Kaveh and Al-Haitham, Al-Haitham and Kaveh</em>, rather than two separate persons. It should bother him more, but when it comes to Nour Aunt he finds its just easier to let her be. </p><p>Under her guidance, Al-Haitham uses the borrowed tools to trim the plants. </p><p>Pieces of dead and dying vegetation fall down to their feet with every snip of the shears. Sap from the stems dries clear over his skin in streaks, releasing a scent that’s sharp enough to cut through most everything else. As the smell cuts through the tide of sensation that’s been dragging him under all day Al-Haitham feels himself finally gain a handhold on his own self. Clarity and focus.</p><p>Nour tells him of which parts to prune — where and at what angle to cut, why and how it will save the plant. She tells him how to know which parts are worth saving, which parts must be saved. </p><p>“You are lucky that mint is so hardy,” she informs him as Al-Haitham cuts and picks out browned and withering leaves and stems. Even after a thorough pruning, there’s a lot of the plant left, and these parts seem almost spiteful in their insistence on remaining green.</p><p>The aloe fares slightly better in terms of pruning, but this is credited to its nature as a desert plant. As it is, several of its segments are pale yellow and thinned, he has to cut and rip away several withered, crackling husks of dead and drained segments from the core. Thin, straggling roots like hair emerge from its center, hidden underneath its sharp, triangular sections.</p><p>The last plant is green onion, which had been left to grow rampant, tall enough it had begun to droop and bend, and then turn brown at the ends. He cuts these down to almost nothing.</p><p>Next comes the re-potting. Nour instructs him on how to twist and pull and ease the plants out of their pots. She stands at his side, pointing to him parts of roots that need to be trimmed. She does not move to help him with her own hands, which he appreciates. She only points or holds the pot or the spade for him. </p><p>She has him crumble the compact, dry soil to release the roots for cutting and untangling and arranging. He lays the plants out on the worn, wooden shelf. With their exposed roots hanging like so they look strange. He can almost reconcile them with the diagrams he’s sometimes seen in botanical texts. Seeing the plants exposed from root to leaf seems strange. This new view of them has his mind settling even further into his body as he takes them in, trying to apply what Nour begins to tell him to the roots before him.</p><p>She tells him the types of root damage, how to recognize it, what caused it — how it could have been prevented and how to treat it in the future. Al-Haitham’s mind latches onto the words, examining their logic and turning them over for flaw and question before ultimately accepting them into himself. He does not interrupt to ask questions. He isn’t of the mind for it right now. And truthfully, Nour Aunt is good at explaining things and his experience in the field is so limited that he doesn’t really have any questions to ask.</p><p>Next Nour has him prepare the new soil; a different compositions for each plant to suit their needs. Under her experienced guidance Al-Haitham mixes sand and gravel and dirt and fertilizer with his hands. </p><p>“<em>Get in there</em>, crumble the dirt and separate the clumps,” she says when his hands hesitate, body trying to retreat from the overwhelming sensation it knows is about to follow. But now that he has a handhold on himself, Al-Haitham brings his body to heel and commands his hands to move and act as he wills.</p><p>The first touch of skin to soil has his fingers curling, but he pushes onward. He remains silent under her instruction, jaw locked against the feeling of discomfort that claws up the back of his throat at the feeling of grit against his nails, his fingers, his arms — all of his skin hypersensitive and distinctly displeased by it. It feels like the sensation is moving, crawling, lingering. Like the touch of insects or cobwebs but a hundred times more disconcerting. It feels like the feeling echoes on itself, even when he tries to brush it away with his palms, doubling and quadrupling on itself. But Al-Haitham’s mind, finally, rallies itself to overpower the body through will alone, corralling all of the body’s wild displeasure into obedience towards a greater goal.</p><p>Al-Haitham focuses on breathing steadily, ignoring the smell of soil and fertilizer, trying to instead focus on the traces of living things. Through his Vision he can feel the plants. He’s read papers written by other Vision users and their resonance with their element. Some of them write about feeling an almost empathetic bond with their elements — especially the dendro users. Al-Hathaim has never noticed this one way or another. Then again, he’s rarely used his Vision to interact with flora. Or for anything outside of combat, really. As Al-Haitham prunes away the dead and sick parts of the plants he can feel the energy within the plants shifting towards the healthier portions, circulating within the smaller body, working at healing and fueling what is left behind. </p><p>The discomfort of his body does not ease, but the repetitive motion of combining the soil and sand and the rest of it into a more even mixture further strengthens his mind’s control over his body and his ability to choose not to react to the discomfort. He is feeling closer to himself, little by little, now that his restlessness has been directed towards a purpose. It is enough. It is better than he’s felt almost all day. But he remains silent, for now content to let Nour talk and his hands act. Nour’s voice flows over and through him, steady in volume and timbre — not quite soothing, but not agitating. Best of all she expects no response other than compliance from his hands.</p><p>She guides him through replanting each of the three plants, pressing new soil down around their roots with his fingers and palms until they each stand upright and centered in their new pots. In the new pots with room to grow and with the dead and withered parts cut away they look much healthier, more likely to survive with continued care.</p><p>Once done Nour nods, collecting the borrowed tools into her basket once more. Al-Haitham sees her back out the door before returning to clean away the cut away roots and the rest of the cut away pieces of vegetation. He finds the broom of bound sticks and starts to sweep the courtyard. He wonders when the last time one of them did any sweeping here. The bristles of the broom hiss over stone. The noise is an irritant, but better than the sound of his own breathing so he accepts this and lets his mind sink into the repetitive scrape of stiff wood as it rasps over stone, clearing away dust and the dried pieces of dirt and the spilled soil from the re-potting.</p><p>He works his way from one side to the other, gathering the dirt and the stray leaves little by little before throwing it away. It seems nonsensical of him to throw dirt away from an open space like this. But when he turns around to look at the stone it looks better. Before he knows what he’s doing he’s getting down onto his knees to start pulling up at the weeds that had sprouted between the stones. He winds them around his bare fingers, pulling them up without mercy. He cheats by using his dendro energy to make sure he’s getting them all the way to the root. He pulls out blades of grass and sturdier weeds as the sun scrawls across the sky and the heat — filtered and softened by the shadow of the Divine Tree — layers over him like another’s breath. His body slowly, steadily, quiets under the heat and the toil. </p><p>Al-Haitham feels sweat bead and cling to his skin, soaking through the fabric of his clothes. He feels the press of stone underneath his knees and his palms as he crawls through the courtyard, clearing it one tile’s worth of space at a time. His back and neck begin to ache but this is the closest he’s gotten to his normal self the entire day so he persists, lest he lose this tenuous handhold on his body once more.</p><p>He goes through he courtyard again with the broom to gather all the ripped up weeds and blades of grass, adding them to the pile of dirt that has stayed mostly intact due to the lack of wind. He gathers all of it up and throws it into the waiting garbage bin, tossing in the green pieces of vegetation into the separate bin to be taken away to the Amurta when the collectors make their rounds later in the week.</p><p>In distant memories of a different house, Al-Haitham remembers his grandmother doing this for their courtyard. It was bigger, though not by much, or perhaps that is his child’s memory at work. From the perspective of a child everything is larger. The courtyard of that house was square, taller than it was wide because his grandmother’s house was two stories. Laundry was hung between posts and Al-Hatham remembers a wooden raised platform where he sometimes lay down to soak in the sun when it was not occupied with drying vegetables and fish. Or, sometimes, flowers.</p><p>Al-Haitham goes inside and finds a bucket in the hallway closet and some spare rags. There’s a coconut husk they use to wax and scrub the floors. It should suit his purposes fine. Al-Haitham fills the bucket from the kitchen sink and goes back to the freshly swept stone and pours the water out, dropping the rag and the coconut husk over it. Then slowly, methodically, Al-Haitham cleans the stone from one corner to the other. He doesn’t bother to count the buckets or the rags he goes through. His legs and arms ache in the way they usually only do after a truly strenuous fight or sparring session with Dehya by the time he’s finished. He feels filthy. Sweat and dirt and water and bits of green that he didn’t catch when he was sweeping are stuck to him and his clothes. He wants to push his hair back but his hands are covered in streaks of black and brown. It’s stuck underneath his nails, it’s in the creases of his palms.</p><p>Al-Haitham’s entire body shivers, that same wild feeling from before bucking against the control of his mind, but an afternoon spent at this unusual and unfamiliar labor has given him enough control to push the reaction down to being manageable with his two clenched fists.</p><p>With just a brief glance, Al-Haitham can tell that the courtyard is already much improved. The tension within him and the buzzing need to act that has been bothering his bones reluctantly begins to ease its grip. There is the release of the assault on one side, would that the other part of his problem ease with it. Although he knows he will not be so fortunate.</p><p>Later, after Al-Haitham has scrubbed off all the dirt and dried sweat, picking out the dirt from underneath his nails and rubbing his arms near raw, he looks out upon the rectangular strip of stone once more. Now that it is freshly cleaned, it somehow looks emptier — slightly less barren and pathetic, but only just. Even so, he finds himself looking upon it with some measure of content in the same way he would for a freshly restored text, or some cypher that he’s just recently cracked, or a connection between different texts.</p><p>He is not quite fully settled back into himself, but he is much better than he was before. With the visible evidence of action yielding a definite result in front of him, the earlier restlessness has been appeased. Now all that is left is the strange diametric pull of forces within his own body that leaves him half-trapped within it and half in exile of it.</p><p>For a moment, as he turns to make himself comfortable in the front room to try and savor whatever is left of the day, Al-Haitham feels the thread of his control slipping, returning him to that strange state of experiencing everything at maximum capacity while operating at less than minimum. But he finds that it is much easier to push the overwhelming feeling that wants to pull him under and away from himself back. He can swallow it down, compact it, and hold it tight to wither without the attention it seems to crave. He is able to, now, put his earphones on and slide their noise cancelling all the way up to maximum. The pressure of the padded metal on his ears is an acceptable discomfort rather than a cost he cannot bear. </p><p>He holds a book in his hands, and is working his way up to actually opening it to read it. He can’t even focus his eyes on the title or author, but he thinks that this might be one the books on Inazuman literature pre-Cataclysm that he had managed to track down. Pity. He had been looking forward to reading it. For now he runs his fingers, his palms, over the spine and the cover, familiarizing himself with the weight and touch of it, waiting for the feeling of it to settle into his hands and make peace with the lingering restlessness in his joints and his nerves.</p><p>By the time Kaveh has returned the sun has long set and Al-Haitham has managed to further reign in the strangeness that had overpowered his mind in favor of his body today; replacing it with his own certainty of himself. There is enough room within his mind to turn attention away from his body’s poor reaction to existing as a body, and he is now mentally preparing himself for work tomorrow. Another stimulating day of rejecting applications, sending the administrators for the new Sage’s back to their higher ups, and picking through the best that the Akademiya has to offer in terms of studies and theories and scholarly disputes. He can almost trick himself into looking forward to it.</p><p>Kaveh comes in, bringing with him his storm of sounds and movement. Mehrak comes in behind him, levitating several leather tubes of what must be plans or projects, or Kaveh’s student’s homework. Kaveh’s mouth moves, perhaps Mehrak is also recording or maybe Kaveh is musing to himself.</p><p>With the noise cancelling on, Al-Haitham cannot hear either of them, but he can somewhat imagine the volume and the cadences of Kaveh’s voice, the sound of his shoes as he steps out of them and pushes them to the side of the door, the sound of his feet against the floorboards and the rustle of paper and the faint sounds of his metal accessories. He can even fill in Mehrak’s sounds of acknowledgement and the sound the machine’s engines and fans make as it follows Kaveh into the house. As Kaveh moves through the front room, Al-Haitham watches him, attention successfully split between the array of colors and suggestions of sound that Kaveh makes and the steady weight of the book in his hands. Al-Haitham considers turning his sound cancelling off, but instinct warns him not to. Not yet.</p><p>There’s a certain exhausted slump to Kaveh’s shoulders. His hair has escaped its pins and the braid, and his feather is slightly askew. As soon as Kaveh lays eyes on him and notices Al-Haitham’s noticing, Kaveh directs his words at him. If his arms were not full of teaching materials, Al-Haitham is sure that Kaveh would be gesturing with them. Al-Haitham feels his control waver, wincing and drawing his shoulders back at the implication of so much sound directed towards his person. It was a good decision to leave the sound cancelling on, although he risks Kaveh being annoyed about Al-Haitham ignoring him.</p><p>Sure enough, Kaveh pauses mid-sentence, eyes narrowing as he looks at Al-Haitham, brows and corners of his mouth drawing downward, shoulders stiffening as they draw back. Al-Haitham braces for a flurry of motion. Perhaps Kaveh will drop his things right there to start signing and gesturing at him. Or he’ll use his Vision or Mehrak to flash the words that Al-Haitham is currently unable to hear.</p><p>But Kaveh, suddenly, sighs, shaking his head, all of the fight draining out of him. Instead, Kaveh moves past him, out of his line of sight. Al-Haitham turns his head to follow and watches as Kaveh sets his things down on the small table at the back of the front room and then walk off in the direction of his own bedroom. If he is still speaking, Al-Haitham cannot tell. But Mehrak bobs along with Kaveh after depositing its own load, briefly turning around just as the pair reach the corner to flash a brief smile at Al-Haitham.</p><p>Al-Haitham is grateful for the reprieve, but curious as to what caused it. Perhaps Kaveh is more tired than Al-Haitham thought he would be. He would have thought that Kaveh was used to his new schedule by now. Or perhaps he’s added on yet another project, another philanthropic deed, to his veritable mountain of self-created responsibilities and charges. If so, Al-Haitham wonders where Kaveh will find the time. He’s already working seven days a week.</p><p>When Kaveh returns to the front room, Al-Haitham has gotten enough of himself together to pay attention to the book in his hands. He was correct, it’s a collection of the Aoi no Okie’s works, each one paired with a critical analysis of what they might have meant in reference to the other Kasen and Inazuma’s political clime at the time. Al-Haitham will have to read through this again later when he is fully returned to his full faculties so he can jot down notes and thoughts for further reading and research.</p><p>Kaveh has with him a tray with some covered dishes on it and a teapot. His hair is dark with water from the bath, and there are damp patches on the shoulders and front of his shirt. Al-Haitham watches out of the corner of his eye as Kaveh makes room for them on the table before sitting next to Al-Haitham on the other side of the divan.</p><p>Al-Haitham waits for Kaveh to do something. But Kaveh just slumps back, stretching his legs and arms in front of himself as he starts to stretch his wrists, his palms, his fingers. His mouth doesn’t move and he doesn’t try to cross the space between them, so Al-Haitham returns to his reading, pushing away his awareness of another body, of another person, and the rest of the world which had been so insistent on making itself painfully known to him for the majority of his day. </p><p>When Al-Haitham pulls himself out at the next good stopping point to rest his eyes, Kaveh is still there. There’s a towel around his neck, and his damp hair has been carefully braided back and arranged over the towel to prevent more water from soaking into this clothes. He’s also reading through and marking up what looks like his student’s latest written assignment. Al-Haitham takes the moment to watch him without being watched in turn.</p><p>For all that he knows that Kaveh is exhausted and drawn into a dozen or more different directions at once, it has been a long time since Kaveh has looked so satisfied with himself. Perhaps it is because it has been a long time since Kaveh has found meaning in his work. Kaveh always leaves too much of himself in everything he puts his hands on, and he has attempted to be selective when he can afford it to ensure that his hands only touch the things that make his mind blaze and his heart stir. Unfortunately, Kaveh has not been able to afford that for some time, and thus, all of Sumeru is touched with golden hands.</p><p>Al-Haitham watches as Kaveh’s lips move, mumbling to himself, idly and slowly spinning his pen as he devotes his attention to the papers of the future that is trying to catch at his heels even as he blazes the way forward for them. He often wonders if Kaveh is aware of this little affectation of his. Sometimes Kaveh is startled by the movement of his own hands as he illustrates a point with sharp flicks of wrist, sweeping rotations of the arm, and fluttering passes of fingertip. Kaveh is absolutely never aware of the way his back and shoulders draw up, drawing the eye and lengthening the already long, lean lines of his body — stretching out bone and shadow and skin and gold to draw the lion out of the man.</p><p>Kaveh is unaware of a lot of things in the same way that he is aware, painfully so, of too many things. Kaveh stands in shadow and light, carved out by the shapes the boundaries have made of him, waxing and waning, with a net zero gain to either side. Al-Haitham is not the only one who could be said to be a contrary thing, a man of paradoxes.</p><p>Al-Haitham considers telling Kaveh about the plants and what a miserable state they were in. Kaveh had forgotten them, his ever growing list of priorities pushing those three plants down further and further until they were out of sight and out of mind. He considers telling him about the courtyard — the dirt, the dust, the weeds, the barren emptiness of it. He should tell Kaveh. They are his plants after all — Kaveh’s choice, Kaveh’s strange attempt at something. And Kaveh doesn’t ever hesitate to complain to Al-Haitham about whatever flaw he’s found in the house that he thinks Al-Haitham should take some blame for not rectifying before Kaveh could notice it.</p><p>Whenever Kaveh does anything around the house — cook, clean, taking out garbage or sorting recyclables, bringing in some new bauble or replacing something — he always makes sure Al-Haitham knows about it. Al-Haitham’s told him time and time again<em>, I did not ask you to do these things. And are these not things that you ought to be doing anyway? Why tell me about it afterwards?</em></p><p>But if he did tell Kaveh about the plants, Al-Haitham knows that Kaveh would feel disproportionately guilty over the neglect that isn’t truly his fault, and isn’t much of a problem or disaster to feel much of anything over. Their lives are not ruined by a single mint plant, a cluster of aloe, and some green onions withering away. And they never look at or spend time in that area of the property. Honestly, Al-Haitham could probably pay to have an extension of the house built over it — they wouldn’t miss that strange patch of stone and sky at all.</p><p>If Al-Haitham tells Kaveh about the plants, Kaveh would feel guilty. And he would force himself to squeeze time and energy into an already at maximum-capacity schedule to care of them with resources and energy he does not have. Kaveh would be angry and guilty about it, and perhaps — as he is with most things involving Al-Haitham — resentful of it. </p><p>What would bringing this up accomplish? More complaints? A more irritable Kaveh who is more likely to make poor decisions? An argument? An argument that will most certainly return them to their complete and total disagreement over the way they each live their lives, leading to the both of them retreating to hide behind closed doors and to barricade themselves into their displeasure with books and work, and perhaps even drink? </p><p>As with any student of the Haravatat and person possessing a shred of common sense and thought processing capabilities, Al-Haitham knows the importance of when to speak and when not to, as well as the redundancy of trying something over and over again despite repeated failures.</p><p>Besides, Al-Haitham may find the rest of it — the poor rates, the terribly demanding time table, the constant appeasement and negotiation of tastes and opinions — distasteful, but Kaveh’s satisfaction is a rare enough thing that Al-Haitham can bite back his comments on the rest for this.</p><p>Thus, Al-Haitham’s mouth remains closed, and he lets the words fade back into the river of thoughts that constantly runs through the back of his mind, the river that goes nowhere and does nothing and exists only when he cares to turn his focus inward and actively look for it. </p><p>Instead he contents himself with looking outward, at Kaveh, observing him in this rare moment where he is, for all intents and purposes, fine.</p><p>Kaveh, refreshed with a bath and perhaps dinner, looks much better. There are still dark circles under his eyes, but there’s a warmth to his face that can only come from chasing purpose. Kaveh’s satisfaction lights him up from within, softly.</p><p>For all that Kaveh finds the moniker “Light of the Kshahrewar” mortifying, if Kaveh could see himself as the rest of them (those who occupy the world and are capable of perception) see him, he would have to admit that the name holds some veracity. </p><p>When Kaveh’s passions consume him, he is as a lighthouse, a torch, shining into the night, into the storm, into the vast beyond without expectation of response. He shines to light the way with the intensity to cut through the darkness of doubt. When Kaveh’s passions are ignited, he could illuminate the night on his own and lead the rest of them into the unknown future with sheer force of will. </p><p>And when those passions inevitably run out of fuel and burn down, even his embers draw others in and near. The breathing embers of his passions draw others close, for the warmth, for the awe of watching the fire breathe itself back to life and build up slowly.</p><p>And when Kaveh strikes the balance between the persisting ember and the living torch, when he is at last satisfied and content with himself in the world for just that one snapshot of time (however brief), it suffuses through him like light through a glass prism — gentled and clear and almost something that can be held in the hands. He has earned the monicker several times over, and continues to prove himself the living embodiment of it every day. </p><p>Although, Al-Haitham could understand how such a thing would be a burden. But this is not something Kaveh can help anymore than Al-Haitham can curb his own bluntness. It is within the very definitions of themselves. What <em>is</em> something they can do is decide how to utilize their definitions, the boundaries of themselves, to their advantage — and this is something Kaveh has not yet understood as applicable in the positive towards himself. Kaveh only sees the negative. </p><p>After muttering to himself some more and going through a few more pages of the assignment of some poor student who is about to be disabused of the idea that they’d be having an easy time in Kaveh’s class, not realizing that Kaveh — as he does with himself — expects the absolute best from anyone who would try to follow along with him and would therefore only lay down challenges at the feet of those who would come before him, Kaveh’s eyes flick upwards in thought, the tip of his pen pressing against his lip. Kaveh’s lips part to bite, and Al-Haitham, recognizing the pen as one of his own (He knew it wasn’t missing, he doesn’t <em>lose</em> pens.), snaps his book shut. He cannot hear the sound, but he can feel it in his palms and see the result when Kaveh jumps.</p><p>The man stares at him, lips parted, eyes wide. Al-Haitham points at the pen and curls his fingers at Kaveh to hand it over before he chews this one into a mess and gets ink over everything. But instead of slapping the pen into Al-Haitham’s palm like he normally would, Kaveh quickly sets the papers and pen aside before turning to fully face Al-Haitham, drawing his long legs up.</p><p>Hands clear, face suspiciously focused, Kaveh gestures to Al-Haitham’s earphones. Al-Haitham slowly lowers the sound cancelling until it is at half power.</p><p>“Better?” Kaveh asks. Al-Haitham’s eyes narrow. Yes, but Kaveh was already gone by the time Al-Haitham was able to drag himself out of his room this morning, and by the time Kaveh returned Al-Haitham had managed to wrestle his body back into compliance. </p><p>Al-Haitham hums, faint discomfort in his throat and gut at the feeling, but otherwise fine. And when Kaveh continues to wait  — here is one of those situations in which he is too aware, too good — Al-Haitham nods.</p><p>Kaveh studies him like Al-Haitham might be lying. With his hands he signals Al-Haitham to wait, and then Kaveh turns, carefully moving to get the wooden tray to place between them. And then Kaveh gets the silver platter, quickly arranging the dishes and cups, removing the cloth covers from the dishes and carefully maneuvering the warm stones that had been keeping certain dishes hot. </p><p>“I bet you haven’t eaten yet,” Kaveh says, pouring steaming water into a cup that has a slice of lemon and ginger and the faint glisten of honey at the bottom. “Easy. I know you hate it, but drink some broth. I hope you’ve been at least drinking some water today.”</p><p>Al-Haitham reaches forward and takes the bowl of almost clear broth. He <em>had</em> eaten earlier — he’d forced himself to choke down some bread and keep it down. He hadn’t felt hungry, but he had felt annoyed and discomfited by the feeling of the dry floured bread against his fingers, his lips, and even more frustrated by the almost mealy texture of the over-ripe apple that had followed.</p><p>The broth is almost tasteless, only containing the faintest touch of salt, chicken, and ginger. The tea is only slightly stronger than that. But it goes down and stays down, and his body doesn’t argue about it. The warmth is good. Al-Haitham feels himself relax.</p><p>As Al-Haitham sips at the tea and broth, feeling the warmth of the liquid and the sharpness of the ginger both soothing and cutting through the remains of the lingering unpleasantness, Kaveh quietly talks about the classes of the day. He had two — one leading a more advanced hands on tutorial class on perspective drawing and composition, and another an optional course unit on working with types of problematic terrain. The last dish is glass, Al-Haitham can see the touch of frost on it. It must have been in the ice box. There are plums, oval, green-purple, and barely the length of Kaveh’s palm.</p><p>Kaveh has a small knife in hand, and he is carefully cutting into each plum, just the thinnest, smallest sliver, as he speaks. He slips each sliver of plum off of the blade into his mouth before sorting the plums into two groups. Some plums Kaveh puts aside to a little dish to his left. Others he puts on another dish to the right. He keeps his voice even, just barely audible over the dampening of Al-Haitham’s earphones.</p><p>When Al-Haitham is done with the broth and the tea, Kaveh pushes the dish on his right forward.</p><p>“There, your reward for behaving,” Kaveh says, mouth and eyes softening.</p><p>The plums are crisp, just firm enough against his teeth. They are a little bitter, close to the skin, and sour at the stone. But they are pleasantly sweet and cool through the middle. Al-Haitham lets the bite sit on his tongue,</p><p>“How did you know?” Al-Haitham feels himself say after the bite of plum has been accepted down the throat without any bodily protest.</p><p>“I came back earlier to leave the plums out for you in the morning. There wasn’t anything else you’d stomach here and I remembered the uncle down the street had an overabundance of plums. Lucky you, they were just the sort that you like no matter what sort of mood the rest of you is in,” Kaveh begins, which doesn’t answer Al-Haitham’s question. “Well. They <em>were</em> all the right sort of ripe <em>then</em>. These ones got too soft because you left them out. I did leave a note telling you to put them away.”</p><p>“How did you know?” Al-Haitham repeats. How did Kaveh know that Al-Haitham would need the plums? How did Kaveh know that Al-Haitham’s body would choose today of all days to revolt, when it had taken Al-Haitham entirely by unpleasant surprise?</p><p>Kaveh smiles, looking like a constantly shifting composition of fond, tired, and exasperated, but unfortunately, consistently handsome and Kaveh-like all the same. “How could I not? Guess.”</p><p>Kaveh sets his hand on the table, arm resting between the dishes, the cup, the knife, the plums, the stones. Al-Haitham’s eyes follow the motion. Kaveh’s hand lays, palm down, just over halfway between them. Perhaps if Al-Haitham were more himself, Kaveh would have reached out further. Perhaps if Al-Haitham were more himself then <em>he</em> would be the one to reach over and close the distance, sliding his fingers underneath Kaveh’s, or covering them. </p><p>But today has been filled with reminder after reminder of how he is <em>not</em> himself, so Al-Haitham acknowledges Kaveh’s accommodation in the only way he can currently give. He slides a half eaten plum into his mouth, stone and all, and offers his book to Kaveh by balancing it on the edge of the wooden tray, closer to Kaveh’s side.</p><p>Kaveh takes it up, turning it over in one hand before he opens it, balancing it onto his thigh, picking out whatever part that catches eye first to begin reading out loud.</p><p>Al-Haitham closes his eyes and feels the weight of stone and flesh in his mouth — the lingering coldness mixing with the heat of his tongue, his cheek, the edge of the stone against the ridge of his teeth lulling his mind into calm emptiness — and just holding it there. His hands curl empty in his lap, but at rest — finally. Kaveh’s voice is near and far at the same time, speaking in the translated patterns of a language that is at home in neither of their mouths.</p><p>A thought rises in him, as Kaveh reads, as the stone presses against the roof of his mouth and the center of his tongue, balancing on that fine edge of too much texture and just enough weight. He wants to keep the stone. Not here, in his mouth, but in general he wants to keep the stone of the plum.</p><p>What for though? To plant? Just earlier today he was out of his depths over mint and onion and aloe, enough so he had to go asking for help. What would he do with a tree? Perhaps he is not as recovered as he thought if he is coming up with such unusually fanciful and whimsical ideas.</p><p>But they are children of the nation of wisdom, presided over by the God of Dreams. What could it hurt, to indulge in such things? Even for a moment?</p><p>Kaveh reads. Al-Haitham imagines, in his mouth, taking root, a tree. He imagines his body as soil. His mouth a bed. He imagines a seed, a stone, as it germinates and cracks out of its protective shell, blind and insensate in the way that everything new must be.</p><p>Al-Haitham holds the image in his mind, not knowing where it goes next, but finds himself unable to imagine how it would progress, although he knows the theoretical stages of a plant’s growth. He tries to imagine the sprouting, the growing, the reaching — the development of a trunk, of stronger, anchoring roots, of branches and leaves. But he can only see the darkness of the ground, the blindness of a shell. He can only imagine the fragile tendrils of exploratory roots withering, unable to find their purchase, and the tentative shoot unable to find the light — all of it withering away as the stalks of onion, the segments of aloe, the leaves of mint.</p><p>The stone’s presence becomes heavy and uncomfortable in his mouth. He lets it go.</p><p>Al-Haitham slides the stone, stripped of most of the flesh, off of the bed of his tongue, past the gates of his teeth, and the curtains of his lips, into the palm of his waiting hand. </p><p>Hand full, body empty, Al-Haitham opens his eyes and slowly turns the noise cancelling of his earphones back up.</p>

<p>There is a saying that nature loves a void. Here is one.</p><p>Al-Haitham’s mind turns back to the empty space hidden by the walls of the house, obscured by the opaque glass of the windows, erased from existence in his and Kaveh’s minds when not observed. And as Al-Haitham is an ever-devoted scholar to proving theories into laws with firsthand experience (when possible), what kind of scholar would he be if he let this question, this curiosity, be?</p><p>There are many reasons he could cite for the strange draw that has him pushing open the windows of his study, the kitchen, the front room; that has him walking around the paved stone rectangle in senseless repetitions; that has him thinking of stopping off at one of the Amurta sections of the House of Daena during his breaks or when he leaves work; that has him slowing as he passes by Nour Aunt’s house; that has him looking out through the crowds of the market to let his eyes linger on a merchant’s array of saplings with their roots wrapped in burlap, flowers and smaller flora in pots, rows upon rows of seeds waiting to be picked and chosen.</p><p>Al-Haitham’s mind turns to the strange satisfaction that had eased the edges of his tension and helped to draw his focus from its strange and ungainly spiral. What was it about the act that calmed him when the individual factors of it were things that should have made him feel worse?</p><p>He is not someone who is normally adverse to dirt, to grime, to sweat, to labor. He tolerates the unpleasant as fair exchange for getting what needs to be done completed. Discomfort is the price paid for greater rewards. More time in preparation means less time in action, which means a shorter path towards the desired outcome. At least, in most aspects of life that he has encountered.</p><p>Al-Haitham wakes up early when he must leave the house to work because if he wakes up early he can get ready without rushing or feeling the need to hurry. He spends a set portion of time once a week to make dough for bread that can easily be prepared by either himself or Kaveh rather than having to go out every day to buy bread, which means less time outside and less mora spent and more time doing other things and using that saved mora on something he cannot make himself, ideally something more intellectually stimulating. He takes the time to write out clear instructions on rejected forms for first time offenders so that he can later point out that they have no excuses for the same mistakes later if — when — they resubmit the same form, still incorrect. He listens to the full arguments of those who come before him, letting them get it all out of their system although he already knows all of his counter-arguments and could shut them down then and there because if they get it all out now they won’t try to interrupt him or try to come back later. He reads through several pages worth of nonsensical and unhelpful introductions in order to find a single paragraph of thought worth ruminating over that can be a potential key to further understanding. </p><p>He has put up with worse than some dirt, some dust. He deals with sand getting into everything whenever he goes out beyond the Wall in order to study or investigate something that has caught his attention. In more recent times, he puts up with the sand and the dry air and the blazing sun to keep up with Dehya and Candace. Both of whom constantly tease him about his distaste for the grit of sand and for how his skin reddens so easily if he doesn’t remember to reapply skin protectant.</p><p>Al-Haitham’s gotten ink stains on his hands and had the same hands go dry with the handling of reams upon reams of paper, leaving his skin feeling strangely tight and powdery. He’s felt the texture of thread fraying underneath his fingertips as he’s worked to diligently restore the spines of books. He has had splinters caught between the skin as he handles wooden slips.</p><p>In the early days of learning how to handle the sword, his calluses from writing had ripped and adjusted in order to accommodate the new ones forming and reshaping his hands with new mastery.</p><p>Nothing has ever been gained by staying clean.</p><p>He does not like the feeling of dirt, of grit on his skin, underneath his nails. Sweat and unnecessary exertion are things he tries to avoid when possible. For once, he thinks that he would be in the majority on this perspective.</p><p>But when Al-Haitham was in the middle of all of that discomfort taken to the almost extreme, heightened by some sensitivity of the body exacerbated by an anxious mind, there was something peaceful about the soil. </p><p>The smells and sounds and sensations of the rest of the world, at the time, were things he was fighting against. The texture of his clean, well worn, and normally comfortable clothing made him want to scratch. The volume of his own breath and voice made him cringe. Everything he put against his mouth made his jaw clench and throat close.</p><p>And yet, when Al-Haitham put his hands into the soil and gravel and sand; when Al-Haitham crumbled the packed dirt around the dry and gnarled roots; when Al-Haitham wrapped stalks of weeds around his fingers and pulled; when he scrubbed dirt from the stone, Al-Haitham’s mind and body found an acceptable level of tolerance there. And afterwards, the satisfaction of a greater payoff that he cannot quite put his finger on. </p><p>Was it that the courtyard that he never looked at was clean? Was it that he had there was a tangible, perceivable, immediate result that he could look upon and show for the time and effort?</p><p>He has thought of it and the possible reasons, the possible answers. He has turned the memory of that afternoon in all of its irascibility over and over, poking at it from different angles to see if he could gain better insight through different perspectives. But unless he finds himself in the same situation again, he does not think that he will be able to properly test the different factors that could have been at play. And he would rather not go through that specific form of restlessness again, if he could help it at all.</p><p>But there is no reason why he could not attempt to recreate the same feeling, or one similar — even without the stressors his body and mind were going through. It is a rather harmless and simple experiment to conduct. </p><p>There are studies that show that the presence of live plants in a space alleviates the mood. Greater numbers of them also provide a change in air quality — depending on the plant, of course. Certain plants are commonly grown for practicality. Some have scents that drive away pests. Others, when grown in conjunction, create their own symbiotic environment. Trees and climbing vines can provide shade or insulation. Flowering plants attract bees and other pollinators which can boost the ecosystem of the environment they grow in. Life calls to life, and with a rise of bees and a proliferation of flowers, would come the fruit, the insects that feed on the pollinators, the birds, the lizards, so on and so forth.</p><p>Then there are plants which have their own utility without further involvement — the aloe, the mint, the green onion that Kaveh had already started being prime examples of such. From that simpler standpoint it would be similar to why Al-Haitham takes time out of the week to prepare dough for bread here at the house rather than buying rounds daily or every two days.</p><p>Green is a soothing color as well. This was one of Kaveh’s arguments for starting that, which could only very loosely and generously, be called a garden. Al-Haitham knew this already. There was a reason why he chose so many features of the house’s interior to be done in shades of green. When they were discussing this and Al-Haitham pointed this out, Kaveh scoffed, shaking his head. And he retorted that the reason why the house’s interior had so many green things in it was because green is the default color for most textiles in Sumeru, and Al-Haitham is too lazy to search something different out to coordinate it with the rest of the furniture. Al-Haitham could privately admit that Kaveh was not entirely wrong — green is a simple and pleasing enough color, easy to get things in, and simple too coordinate. But if Al-Haitham did not like the color he wouldn’t have surrounded himself in it, no matter how easy it was to get his hands on.</p><p>It does not escape him that these are the very same arguments that Kaveh used on him once, the very same ones that he, himself, refuted. And now they are the very same ones that he uses to spur himself into action.</p><p>Although, really, when it comes down to it, Al-Haitham does not need any reason other than the fact that he is curious and he wants to do this.</p><p>(This was really all the reason Kaveh needed, too.)</p><p>And this curiosity now leads him to standing in the door of the kitchen to the rectangle of cleared stone, looking out at the wall and opaque glass that conceal his study. In his hand he holds several paper packets of seeds. The mint came from one such seed packet. The aloe was a cutting given to Kaveh by Nour Aunt. The onion was from their groceries. But Kaveh planted the mint first — Al-Haitham isn’t sure why. But Kaveh planted the mint first because he only had the three pots, and tucked the rest of the packets away for another time. Another time failed to come around, and the seeds were left in the dark, the paper packets all pushed up to one side of an empty tea canister in the back of a cupboard. </p><p>Now, another time has come but in Al-Haitham’s hands. He looks down at Kaveh’s neat writing across each paper packet. Kaveh had not bought these at a store. Kaveh had come home from visiting at one of the neighbor’s houses with the seeds in hand and the three pots. That same afternoon, Kaveh carefully cleaned the root ends of the green onion and planted them in the first pots. The next day Nour Aunt had given him the aloe. And a few days later, Kaveh planted the mint seeds.</p><p>Once<em> (many</em> times really) Kaveh, in the heat of the moment during an argument, had accused Al-Haitham of being utterly unsympathetic and utilitarian and calculating to a punishing extreme, on purpose to antagonize. Kaveh has also accused him of wasting his abilities, an odd accusation considering that Al-Haitham could more easily prove Kaveh guilty of that particular flaw. </p><p>“You seem to imply that there is a tangible loss from inaction,” Al-Haitham has argued with him whenever Kaveh has mourned the supposed waste that comes from Al-Haitham’s perceived passivity. “But you are relying upon imagined and presumed influx to create an artificial gain, which is, by every measure, poor accounting. Just because the potential for something exists does not mean it <em>must</em> be acted upon. Existence does not necessitate action. Capability does not automatically promise application. It <em>can</em> be argued that staying my hand is not a form of neutrality, however for it to be considered an <em>active</em> subtraction is taking it a step too far. Or do you fault the tree for standing instead of being felled for lumber?”</p><p>And whenever Al-Haitham has said as much to Kaveh, Kaveh has rolled his eyes or curled his lip or sneered — “You wouldn’t understand. Of course <em>you</em> can’t see it.”</p><p>Al-Haitham is not particularly bothered by any of the things that Kaveh has said of him. What Kaveh sees as extreme utilitarianism and egoism, Al-Haitham sees as setting and establishing a clear boundary, and what Al-Haitham sees in Kaveh as excessive self-sacrifice to the point of self-destruction, Kaveh sees as a requisite to keep society moving along. Kaveh can argue with Al-Haitham over how Al-Haitham wastes his talents by holing himself up in the archives, and Al-Haitham can argue back that Kaveh’s own efforts as one single man trying to patch inherent structural flaws in their society through one act of perceived kindness at a time is just as wasted.</p><p>They have each told the other of the benefits from borrowing a page out of each other’s books. Is that the case here? Is this a situation in which it would behoove him to place himself in Kaveh’s shoes to try and understand it?</p><p>Al-Haitham finds himself curious. Is this, this act of growing and tending, something he — who many, not just Kaveh, would describe as cold, uncaring, and harsh — is capable of? It is not something he has tried before. Al-Haitham knows that he is not a particularly nurturing or comforting person. He never has been and he never will be. At best, if he is being incredibly generous towards himself, he would say that he has tempered somewhat over time, learning when it is appropriate to withhold his opinion or stay his hand. Al-Haitham has learned when and where to bow his head and make concessions, to concede to another’s lead in order for his own path to continue along the one of least resistance. He has learned, through years of trial and error, how to make himself palatable to others when it suits his purposes. But it is not his natural state of being. He is not like Kaveh, who routinely weighs other’s comforts and opinions directly with his own before considering his actions and wants.</p><p>These things that he has learned do not translate towards the physical act of care, of tending.</p><p>Al-Haitham closes his fingers around the paper packets, feeling the minute shift of seeds inside of them. As his hands turn them over his mind turns over questions of potential. He thinks of the feeling of the plum stone in his mouth and that strange desire to keep it, to hold it, to imagine it flourishing and the disappointment and irritation that came when he could not. He thinks of his own self and this neglected facet of his character, his life, that may or may not have the potential to succeed. He thinks of the seeds, and the hypothetical shame it would be that they never reach their own potential for success — forever stuck in the dark of their shells. Is this how Kaveh would think of it? And would Kaveh, too, feel guilt for these forgotten things?</p><p>Although he is curious about this persistent and nagging train of thought and inquiry that has begun to rise from the river of his mind, overtaking the banks of more conscious and purposeful thoughts, he still finds himself reluctant to move forward in what should be a simple test. The answers will rise easily enough if he just plants a few seeds and waits for time to do the rest. It is not the act, the effort, that holds him back.</p><p>Kaveh’s neat print — the ink slightly feathered from the quality of the paper and the heavy hand of the pen and possibly texture of the surface he wrote on — is perfectly straight across the top of each fold of the packets without slant and with perfect spacing between each letter. The ink is black and bold against the worn paper.</p><p>Kaveh can be strangely proprietary over his things. He is not usually a man who is overzealous about the ownership and dividing of property, over things. For someone who has so little to his name, one would think that it would encourage him to be, but Kaveh remains selfless and free with what he has, sometimes to his own detriment. Kaveh gives himself away too easily, even as he regrets the consequences of his actions as he watches them approach. The only exception to this magnanimity is Al-Haitham. Al-Haitham is, as always, the exception to Kaveh’s rules — his meticulous control and civility.</p><p>Al-Haitham does not begrudge Kaveh this; after all, Kaveh is Al-Haitham’s exception, more often than he is not. There is something about the two of them when they are in proximity to each other (sometimes physical, sometimes metaphorical) that causes them to act out in ways that are not their usual character. One could argue that if a person acts a certain way in a certain situation, that is part of their character. Something does not come from nothing. And yet Al-Haitham, during those fights, sometimes feels himself as though he were an observer and cannot recognize himself. Their familiar selves twist and transform, catalyzed by some ineffable component that passes between them. It is sometimes a good thing. It is usually not.</p><p>When it comes to Kaveh, Al-Haitham finds himself starting fights that he can’t escape, like snares that only ever tighten and make the wound worse. Al-Haitham does not usually do it on purpose. Lately he has gotten better at avoiding the pitfalls. And it is not necessarily the fighting that bothers him — it’s the pain. Al-Haitham has withstood greater slander and insults from half of the Akademiya. Most of it has been delivered straight to his face. But none of it has ever reached him in quite the same manner as the words that Kaveh has come up with in their fraught moments.</p><p>Al-Haitham has taken up the tin with the packets of seeds, holding it in his hands, several times over the past few weeks. He has gone out to check on the re-potted plants to see if they had taken to their new soil, and every time he has looked his mind has turned towards these seeds and the question of potential they contain. This is not a question that he thinks will go away if he continues to ignore it.</p><p>If Kaveh is upset with Al-Haitham for planting the seeds that he has left to be forgotten, Al-Haitham will make it up to him with something else. There is a question that Al-Haitham needs to answer. Kaveh would understand. If there is one thing they both agree on, it is the pursuit of answers and the resolution of mysteries.</p><p>-</p><p>In hindsight it seems strange for him to realize it only now, but Al-Haitham had not considered that there could be something meditative about the act of planting. There is a process, a series of steps, and repetitive motion that doesn’t require much in terms of higher level thoughts and concentration, yes. But he had not thought that the route actions could be peaceful.</p><p>If this were not so, he doesn’t think there would be so many people across Teyvat who do this as a hobby. But he did not put it together until he began to do it, himself. </p><p>Today his hands are <em>his</em> hands, obedient and perfectly in tune with what he needs and what he wants. His skin is simply skin, and his nerves are exactly as sensitive as they should be — no more and no less. Dirt is just dirt and it’s nothing to him to feel it against his skin, cool and moist and strong in the nose.</p><p>There truly is something soothing in the act, the labor. Al-Haitham mixes soil according to the notes he’d jotted down from a few introductory Amurta texts from the House of Daena. He feels sand and soil and fertilizer slip through his hands, his fingers, over and over again. It is like when he sifts the dry ingredients when he bakes. There is something meditative and calming about that, too. </p><p>Although baking does require a little more of his active focus to make sure the ratios for that are maintained properly, and some consideration towards conditions of humidity and temperature and texture of flour and salt and all the rest as it combines. Baking is an exact science until it isn’t.</p><p>Nevertheless, Al-Haitham feels his body relax into the familiar motions of mixing with the hands, feeling for clumps to break up and for pockets that have not been properly evened out. There is even something familiar in the way he must tamp down the soil, making sure it is evenly dispersed and compact enough to not completely sink into itself when whetted. </p><p>He buries the seeds as per the instructions he had read, careful to make sure that they are not too deep, but not exposed. He waters them and arranges them on the remaining shelves underneath Kaveh’s onion, aloe, and mint. He neatly labels each pot and leaves the question in the hands of nature’s consideration to reply to.</p><p>Over the next few days he checks the seeds when he goes to water Kaveh’s plants. He can see no visible progress, but the Divine Tree wasn’t grown in a day, so he isn’t too worried about it. Kaveh’s plants, at least, seem to be doing better now that they have a daily minder again.</p><p>He has not yet told Kaveh of his experiment, because he has not told Kaveh about tidying the courtyard or how he re-potted and pruned Kaveh’s plants. If he did he is sure there would either be many questions or many comments and Al-Haitham does not care to handle either of them at this juncture of the process. Perhaps once he has the results he will tell Kaveh. Or, Kaveh can go out there on his own and put two and two together. Al-Haitham, under normal circumstances, would be surprised that Kaveh has not noticed already.</p><p>But Kaveh’s role of guest lecturer has taken up more of Kaveh’s time than either of them would have expected — neither of them having held roles in actual teaching in years, if being student aides count — and his routine has become one almost similar to Al-Haitham’s in its new level of consistency. Kaveh rises, he eats, he’s leaves to work for several hours, then drags himself back when the moon has long risen to eat, works for several more hours, then sleeps. The only good thing about this rigorous cycle is that Kaveh is being paid a fair and consistent rate for his time, for once. It does not make up for the fact that Kaveh looks increasingly drained, but it’s at least something.</p><p>Most evenings Kaveh is quiet, thoughts focused on any of the dozens of other things he must be doing, whether it is for the Akademiya or any of his private ventures. Al-Haitham does not mind this. At least when Kaveh is quiet they are not bickering, which only ever makes things worse for Kaveh. </p><p>Sometimes Kaveh talks about the classes he’s leading, the practical demonstrations he’s trying to plan out, or other smaller things. Al-Haitham listens and offers nothing of his own daily toil in return. There is nothing particularly exciting or any variable changes from day to day in his job duties as Scribe, which is exactly how he prefers it. The interesting things should be personal, not professional, which allows for a greater degree of freedom in how to address them and discretion in with whom these interesting things could be shared with. </p><p>On the occasion that Kaveh does put in the effort to speak, Al-Haitham puts in the effort to listen, commenting only on the things that Kaveh says that seem to be targeted towards gaining some sort of response from him. And on these same occasions that Kaveh musters up the energy to talk, he also always ends with a question. Kaveh always makes sure to ask, at least once, “And what have you been up to recently, outside of your much beloved monotony as Scribe?”</p><p>That afternoon when Al-Haitham checked on the plants he had finally seen the begins of the first green shoots pushing through the soil. It had been unexpectedly pleasing. When Kaveh, over washing and drying dishes together, asks Al-Haitham that routine question Al-Haitham, answers, “I am doing work in the courtyard.”</p><p>Kaveh blinks, head tipping to the side. Some of the exhaustion seems to be chased from his shoulders and hands as he straightens up a little, energized with his own curiosity. But his eyes narrow in suspicion and his mouth turns down at the corners. This is not the response Al-Haitham thought he might get, but he supposes that with his own track record for independent research ventures he can somewhat understand Kaveh’s apprehension. The last time Al-Haitham decided to pursue a topic independently it led to him getting swept up into a grand conspiracy to install a new god over Sumeru. But such an immediate negative reaction is odd. Especially when Kaveh leans forward, towards him, sharp eyes narrowing further as his gaze sweeps over Al-Haitham like he’s looking for something.</p><p>“What sort of work? You’re taking work home? Why? I thought people were leaving you alone, now. Have you told Lord Kusanali?”</p><p>Ah.</p><p>“I am <em>experimenting</em> in the courtyard. It is an <em>independent</em> investigation,” Al-Haitham corrects and clarifies. Kaveh’s mouth and eyes immediately turn from worried and suspicious to relaxed and amused. He shakes his head, body relaxing as he straightens up again to focus on the washing, long hair whispering over his shoulders in light waves.</p><p>“About time,” Kaveh laughs, tossing some of those waves of light over his shoulder, which returns Al-Haitham to confusion. Kaveh pauses the washing to poke his wet and soap-covered finger to Al-Haitham’s cheek. “You’ve been too quiet recently, you know. Even for you. <em>Especially</em> for you. Everyone’s noticed. The other day Cyno was even telling me how worried he was.”</p><p>Al-Haitham’s confusion only grows, but Kaveh just smiles like this is something entirely routine for them; people worrying about Al-Haitham; Al-Haitham being <em>someone</em> to worry <em>about</em> instead of <em>something</em> to worry <em>over</em>; others observing something about him that would cause them to have enough concerns to speak of it to others who would agree and share such concerns and interests in Al-Haitham as a personal topic. He is not sure what he feels about this.</p><p>“You are not yourself unless you are turning something over in that head of yours,” Kaveh says to Al-Haitham’s unspoken question. “There’s a difference between laid-back and directionless. You are usually one but never the other. You won’t be telling me the experiment until it takes off or it’s over.”</p><p>“No,” Al-Haitham confirms. “But you have eyes. And legs.”</p><p>The courtyard is just beyond the door to their left. Kaveh could even push the window in front of them open, lean forward, and look at the row of plants if he pleased.</p><p>“I can observe for days and still come to a different set of conclusions than you. As we so love to argue and agree upon in turns when it pleases us to — and even when it doesn’t —, the matter of perception is wildly variable and depends upon where one stands.” Kaveh’s hand lowers to rest between them on the edge of the sink, palm up. Kaveh is dripping water and soap over the edge onto the floor. Al-Haitham is fully himself today, so he reaches over to cross that small distance and touches his fingertips to Kaveh’s worn and familiar palm. Kaveh’s fingers half-close around Al-Haitham’s, but do not close fully. “Do you think you’ll discuss your findings with me when it’s over?”</p><p>Seeing as how Kaveh was partially the inspiration for this venture, Al-Haitham probably should. And Kaveh would certainly have insights that Al-Haitham does not, which would be very helpful in understanding why this particular interest has decided to latch onto his conscious mind like so.</p><p>“Yes.” Al-Hatham taps his fingertips to Kaveh’s wet palm. “Tell me of your students in Ormos. Were you able to procure enough copies of the manual of basic drafting diagramming and notation to pass around?”</p><p>-</p><p>Over the next few days, Al-Haitham observes more of the pale green, pale white, shoots attempt to break through soil. He is tempted to try and assist, but they are fragile things in a precarious state and he is unsure if it would help or hinder. The temptation to speed the process up with his Vision is also present, but that would definitely skew the results and would not answer Al-Haitham’s question of potential. After all, anyone with a dendro Vision can grow anything. Al-Hatham wants to know if he, <em>himself</em>, is capable of it.</p><p>The problem with this experiment is that, at this stage, it is mostly a matter of time. Waiting. Al-Haitham can only go and look at them and literally watch them grow, which is not very stimulating or interesting. He occupies himself with slowly making his way through the books he’d acquired. Several of which have actually been given to him by others, which has certainly expanded his repertoire beyond his normal topics of choice. It’s different, but not bad. Al-Haitham has also taken to reading up on more recent Rtawahist publications — mostly so he can better understand and ask questions of the papers Layla quietly asks him to read over for her. The material is not particularly interesting to him, but Layla is good company and she and Kaveh get along very well. </p><p>Kaveh seems to see something familiar in her, and has grown something of a soft spot for her. This soft spot is most likely the reason why he put her in touch with Al-Haitham for assistance in reviewing her papers. Kaveh did not outright tell Al-Haitham to help her, nor did he directly tell Layla to ask. But he has put them in close proximity enough times, and mentioned Layla’s papers and Al-Haitham’s academic excellence and his previous reputation as a much-in-demand paper-reviewer for their fellow undergraduates, that the both of them could start talking. Al-Haitham, in this specific situation, can see and agree with Kaveh’s softness for the young woman. The two carry several similarities, for all that their chosen fields are incredibly different. This is one of the reasons why he has agreed to assist her when he has availability. The other is that she is, as aforementioned, <em>actually</em> <em>good</em> <em>company</em>. She’s quiet, and when she is not quiet, she gets to the point if he tells her to, and she does not seem to mind his blunt manner overly much. At least, not more than she minds anything else.</p><p>Between this, as well as his assistance to Tighnari and Collei in reviewing the young girl’s independent studies to make sure they’re aligned with the Akademya’s independent study guidelines, and making his way through the books that have found their way to him through one channel or another, Al-Haitham has plenty enough to do as he waits for the seeds to sprout.</p><p>He goes out for dinner with Cyno and Dehya, who has brought Nilou and Candace, and stays quiet as the four of them talk around him, content with him simply being there. He gets tea and pastries with Nilou and Dehya, and is formally introduced to Senior Faruzan who has recently hired Dehya for assistance in gathering research beyond the Wall of Samiel. Tighnari begins hosting classes in Pardis Dhyai and Gandharva VIlle, sending progress reports on both to the Akademiya for formal review and filing. Al-Haitham reads these reports over as they come to him and files them away for future reference and analysis as the classes progress. Kaveh takes a section of his students from the Akademiya for a three day long practical lecture in the field to observe methods for shoring up land that has already been built on, and how to assess types of foundational damage for whether it’s feasible to repair under existing circumstances and when it’s better to just tear the whole thing down and start anew. Kaveh comes back with several complaints that he shares with Al-Haitham, Layla, Senior Faruzan, Tighnari, Nilou, and Cyno over a lunch that goes on for several hours. Lord Kusanali calls him in to assist her in sorting out Akasha data that shows signs of previous Sage tampering that went around Al-Haitham’s office and purview. </p><p>Time creeps forward as the seeds do, and Al-Haitham watches as some of the sprouts break free of their seeds, as some stall and seem to curl up — giving up — and some get tangled up and confused on which way is up and which way is down. With the passivity of this activity and lack of anything else to truly occupy his thoughts, a new form of anxiety and unease takes root. Al-Haitha is not proficient in this field and is starting anew as a novice. There is something vastly different between tending to a plant that has already grown and settled in its maturity, and tending one up from seed.</p><p>When he is alone and otherwise unoccupied, his mind strays towards this thought, this question, of nurture and nature, capability and capacity, potential acted upon and potential falling short, and of course — potential that does not exist. It is not like him to be so acutely focused on the potential for failure. Al-Haitham thinks of himself as practical, but not pessimistic. This strange anxiety, almost fear, of barren soil and failure is odd for him. But he cannot quite shake it. It’s vastly different from the approach he takes when he studies and tests his usual scholarly endeavors — he’s never feared the failure of a research venture before. Failure is just another type of result after all. But here, in this specific context, he finds himself worrying. Are the seeds growing too fast? Too slow? Is this normal progress? Has he already, so early in this venture, fallen short and received his answer?</p><p>The first few seeds that had sprouted and begun to grow stall, and then wither. Al-Haitham examines them and tries not to feel disappointment. He can try again — there are still plenty of seeds left in the packets Kaveh had stowed away. And the initial failure can be attributed to any number of factors. Perhaps Al-Haitham had planted the seeds too close to each other, or too close to the surface, or too far beneath it. Perhaps they were not getting adequate light or water — or overly much of it. The soil composition could have been effected by the minerals n the water. The fertilizer might have been too much. Or perhaps the seeds were simply bad — too long in the dark of that little tea canister in the cupboard. </p><p>Al-Haitham tries again and waits for the roll of the dice to determine their fates. More time passes. Kaveh brings back arms full of coffee bean samples and pulls out all of the cups in their house to test them. Cyno endeavors to put an interest for Genius Invokation’s novel adaptation into Al-Haitham’s head during the build-up of the latest tournament to sweep through Teyvat. Al-Haitham attempts to get an interest but predicts every single turn in the plot before it happens and finds himself skimming instead of actually reading. It’s an overall decent story, just predictable to someone who’s spent a majority of their life reading and analyzing texts near constantly. The illustrations are pleasing, though. They match the art style for the cards. Senior Faruzan puts forward a formal request his assistance in a a translation project for Deshret-Era machine codes, as he is uniquely qualified with both a Haravatat and Kshahrewar background with a decent enough foundation in the Vahumana. Nilou and Al-Haitham consider source material for new productions at the Zubar theater that would be in-line with Lord Kusanali’s new directives for spreading the arts and exploring more creative freedoms, referencing some of Liyue’s newest operas and Inazuma’s latest writing trends.</p><p>The seeds die — some never sprouting, others getting up to almost the size of his thumb before withering. Al-Haitham tries one final time with the last of Kaveh’s seeds, but does not hold his breath on different results. </p><p>Surely enough, a few weeks later Al-Haitham must conclude that this is not something for him. It was a learning experience at least, and now Al-Haitham knows for sure that this is not something he is capable of. There are still several other factors he has not tested in different combinations, but Al-Haitham’s touch has remained a consistent one throughout all of these rounds of experimentation. Therefore it would not be unreasonable for him to consider that it’s simply something deficient in himself that has caused the plants to die over and over again. </p><p>This conclusion settles in him uneasily, some part of himself resisting this answer despite all evidence in front of him that would suggest it as the most viable one.</p><p>After all, more often than not, the simplest answer is the correct one.</p><p>As Al-Haitham starts putting away the pots, plucking out the withered bits of seeds and sorting through the soil to see if some of them germinated at all or if they just stayed inert, he mentally goes through his conclusion. It was an amateur mistake for him to get into an experiment that hopes and aims for a specific outcome, although he should think that in this specific context it is not entirely something he can be faulted for. Does anyone ever wish for personal failure?</p><p><em>Is it</em> a personal failure that he cannot grow things, though? And here again, Al-Haitham returns to the question of potential that he and Kaveh often argue over. Al-Haitham has never grown things before. There was a question of potential within him that was not explored. But is proof of a negative a loss when he has never actively put anything forward into the world before? Is the net gain of this not perfectly neutral? Nothing has been added, nothing has been removed, from the state of the world.</p><p>Perhaps Al-Haitham’s ability lies in…other forms of care. Perhaps he is not meant to start an endeavor, to encourage new growth. This is entirely possible. After all, Kaveh’s plants seem to have made a full recovery and are back to the state they were before Kaveh’s schedule became a tangled mess that makes Al-Haitham’s head hurt to look at. Al-Haitham is very good at taking things over from others, when others come to their own stumbling blocks. It’s part of why he was always so in demand for assistance in reviewing papers and projects before submissions, even if he, himself, was not looked upon very favorably. Al-Haitham is good at filling in gaps and connecting fractured pieces; completing sentences that other people have begun but could not quite finish. But he is not, himself, a very good impetus.</p><p>Now that he thinks on it, everything he’s ever done has been pieced together from other’s work. This is not, he understands, a <em>bad</em> thing. This is how most people are. If anything at least this is something Al-Haitham can share with the common majority. Not everyone is a mover and shaker of the world; there are only so many times that a new discovery can be made.</p><p>So why, then, does this bother him so much? Why does the question persist despite the natural conclusion he has drawn?</p><p>Al-Haitham frowns down at his hands, sorting through soil to examine the seeds that simply didn’t sprout, and the faint, hair-thin strands of roots that somehow did not progress enough to break the rest of the shoot out of its shell.</p><p>Perhaps this is another mystery of the world that cannot, should not, be answered. Al-Haitham moves to throw out the seeds and the soil and stops when he sees a small finch huddled up on the edge of the windowsill in front of him. The finch puffs its feathers when he looks up, but does not move. </p><p>Al-Haitham, crouched down, watches the finch watching him. He rests his arms, aware of the dirt that clings to his hands and wrists, on his thighs and nods at the bird.</p><p>“Lord Kusanali. If there is an emergency I would remind you that I am no longer Acting Grand Sage and that the appropriate authorities and channels for emergencies do not involve the Scribe, or any scribe, of the Mahamata. Such authorities are required to be present at the Akademiya at all times in overlapping shifts to prevent a gap in coverage. Also, I am getting close to the threshold for acceptable overtime hours and I still have not been given my full compensation from previous overtime.”</p><p>Lord Kusanali, through the body of the finch, into Al-Haitham’s mind, laughs. The bird flutters its wings.</p><p>“I cannot see you because I want to see you?” Lord Kusanali asks, bird head tilting as she hops down one way of the window ledge, then the other. “I like to check on my people now and again, to make sure all is well.”</p><p><em>My people</em>, Al-Haitham turns the words over in his head. In this context, it would be easy to assume she means the people of Sumeru. Lord Kusanali is a kind god, although Al-Haitham does not have much experience when it comes to gods. The extent of her care goes broad and deep. Perhaps gods are the only ones capable of caring so vastly and easily without suffering for it in the way mortals do. Perhaps it is innate to the nature of godhood to be able to care like so. That is its own study. But he does not feel Ike that broader sense is the one she means here.</p><p>“Do you mind it?”</p><p>“No,” Al-Haitham decides, holding his hand out to her. The bird hops onto his finger, the little prickle of the finch’s talons and thin toes almost ticklish. He brings her closer to his eye level. “Is your curiosity satisfied?”</p><p>“This is <em>Sumeru</em>, Al-Haitham,” Lord Kusanali says, note of teasing disapproval in her voice. “That should be answer enough for you.”</p><p>“Another question then: what would cause my potential wellness to come into question that you must look into it?” </p><p>Al-Haitham slowly turns his hand palm up as Lord Kusanali shuffles around on his fingers, making herself comfortable sitting on his palm. He can feel the beat of the birds heart, the soft texture of feathers, and the minute shifting of the bird’s legs. He idly wonders if the bird has parasites he should be worried about. Lord Kusanali pecks at his thumb.</p><p>“I could cut out the middleman and become a flea at your ear if that would answer your question,” she teases.</p><p>“No, thank you.”</p><p>“You are a strange one,” Lord Kusanali says, returning to his earlier question. The one he actually voiced. “I think it is easy to assume that all is well with you, because you are normally so unaffected by most things that would trouble others. You shrug off problems and troubles with an ease and grace that I find admirable. But you are not impervious to them.”</p><p>“I <em>am</em> just a man,” he agrees.</p><p>“You are not <em>just</em> anything. You seemed disappointed when I arrived to look in at you. Would you care to share what the trouble is?”</p><p>“The seeds did not grow,” Al-Haitham tells her, lowering his hand so she can turn around and look at the seeds and the soil he was throwing away. She already saw. She could most likely draw the correct conclusion just by looking at the scene before her. Lord Kusanali hops onto his fingertips, examining the seeds, sorting through the dirt with the bird’s beak.</p><p>“Tell me of the not-growing.” </p><p>So he tells her of his question, and of his failure. The experiment is already over, he sees no reason why he shouldn't. It was no real secret. Lord Kusanali hops off of his hand to inspect the seeds, and then Kaveh’s plants, and then jumps back to Al-Haitham’s hand. By the time he has finished telling her of his attempts at growing plants from seed, she has nestled into his palm with the bird's eyes closed.</p><p>“Question: is a hypothesis that is proven wrong a failure?”</p><p>“No. It is simply an answer that has been ruled out.”</p><p>“Correct. Another question for you; what prevents you from altering your hypothesis and trying again? Since when did you give up so easily?” The finch’s eyes open as Lord Kusanali, through them, examines him with her own scholar’s curiosity and drive.</p><p>“I am not giving up <em>easily</em>,” Al-Haitham argues, insulted at the idea. “I tried until I ran out of seeds. Besides, in this case, it would appear that the factor that needs changing is <em>myself</em>. It would be rather difficult to conduct an experiment that seeks to test my own ability by removing me from the test entirely.”</p><p>Lord Kusanali flutters from his hand, hopping onto his wrist, his arm — as he moves his arm to keep her closer to eye level, she shuffles up his arm until she is at his shoulder.</p><p>“Who says that the factor cannot be changed? Tell me, Al-Haitham, are you, yourself, incapable of change? Are you not flesh? Spirit? What part of you is locked into place? Even stone changes over time. Look around you, for you have been a vessel of change for an entire country, an entire culture. Besides this, are you not a scholar, the very definition of what it means to change? I pose that what you lack is simply experience and information, not inherent capability. And even if you were somehow incapable of this, this is not something that could not be surmounted by acquisitions of the former two. Are these things not easy enough to acquire, especially in the land of dendro and knowledge? Further testing is needed before you draw this incredibly final conclusion.”</p><p>Al-Haitham sighs. “Are you giving me an assignment?”</p><p>Lord Kusanali’s flaps the bird's wings close to his ear and he resists the urge to jerk away. She stills, apologetically moving away from him to flutter and settle on the ground next to the vacated pots. She gestures to them with the wing.</p><p>“You have given yourself an assignment, and I think it would be a shame if you did not see it through properly to the end. You do yourself a disservice to stop here and settle with the easy answer.”</p><p>Al-Haitham resists the urge to sigh again. </p><p>“How about this,” she begins and Al-Haitham — if his hands were not dirty — would rub his palms down his face and groan, because this tone of voice of hers can only be work and trouble. Most likely it will be both. “It shall be a commission, a private charge, from me to you. I’ll get you more seeds to get you started again. And you shall report back to me what you find. If you truly feel that, after another — <em>more informed</em> — good faith attempt, you are getting nowhere, we can discuss that, too. Then let the subject drop. But I believe that this is a topic that deserves further consideration and efforts.”</p><p>Al-Haitham narrows his eyes. “You want me to write a report on a garden.”</p><p>“Well. You don’t <em>have</em> to write anything down. But it may be insightful as a log for any thoughts and observations you may have. It would also be helpful in showing your findings to others. We could review it together, if you like. Besides, it has been quite a while since your last proper study, hasn’t it?”</p><p>Al-Haitham’s last attempt at a study was on Divine Knowledge Capsules. Knowing where <em>that</em> particular line of inquiry led him has him feeling suitably dubious about where this current one might go. Lord Kusanali, probably remembering the same thing, trills a soft laugh, moving forward to press the side of the finch’s head against the back of his lowered hand.</p><p>“There is something you know that I do not,” he says instead. Because he does not think Lord Kusanali would push on this topic otherwise.</p><p>“That is my prerogative as a god, yes,” she admits easily enough. “But I shall not be telling you what it is, just like I know you wouldn’t ask. The answer I give you would not matter as much as the one you learn for yourself, and you know this, too.”</p><p>“This better not result in a new government,” Al-Haitham half mutters to himself as he empties the pots of mixed soil into a half-empty sack with the rest of the unmixed soil. “And if it does, I want no part of it.”</p><p>Lord Kusanali trills another light laugh, fluttering up and into the air, flying wide circles around him.</p><p>“So is that a yes?”</p><p>Al-Haitham sighs. He’s got to do something with the pots and remaining fertilizer anyway.</p><p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Al-Haitham wakes the next day half-hoping that the events of the previous afternoon were imagined. And if they were not imagined, that he could stay home and avoid the Akademiya where he knows that Lord Kusanali will be waiting for him. Unfortunately, it is a work day and half of the reason why his schedule is manageable is because he has created boundaries and enforced them, but that means sticking to them so people don’t have an excuse to barrel past them citing, “We couldn’t get you at any other time!”</p><p>He rises and dresses, mentally going over his list of things on his schedule and all of the ways he could possibly hide from Lord Kusanali in the hopes that she might change her mind or forget. Both are unlikely but a man can dream in Sumeru nowadays, so that’s what Al-Haitham does. He does not know <em>why</em> she is so intent on this very specific thing, but what business does he have knowing the prerogatives of gods?</p><p>Kaveh is on his way out the door when Al-Haitham enters the front room, rattling off memorandums to Mehrak to remind him of later, shoving his feet into his shoes and hurriedly patting himself down to make sure he hasn’t forgotten anything. Al-Haitham waits for Kaveh to be mostly done, hand on the door, before sighing and clearing his throat. </p><p>“I’m already late! Whatever it is, we’re both going to same place — send a runner!” Kaveh says as Al-Haitham cuts over him, “Key.”</p><p>Kaveh fishes the golden metal out of his pocket, waving it over his shoulder and smirking; triumphant. Al-Haitham turns to look at the shallow wooden bowl by the door, clarifying himself dryly, “<em>Other</em> key.”</p><p>Kaveh blinks. Then he pats his pockets down again, hands getting more hurried when they turn up nothing. He groans turning towards the bowl and sighing, “If they’d just let me keep the thing I could put it with the rest. What shortage of metal are we on that we can’t have <em>multiple</em> studio room keys so that we’ve got to share them?”</p><p>“Kaveh,” Al-Haitham calls out again just as Kaveh has turned around once more. </p><p>This whole endeavor, in many ways, started with Kaveh. It would not hurt to ask for his advice on how to move forward. Furthermore, Al-Haitham has limited experience in studies like these. Most of Al-Haitham’s experience when it comes to research is entirely theoretical, or extremely limited in practical scope. Most of his work is confined to paper, from figurative cradle, to battleground, to grave. He is unsure of how to proceed in a more physical, tangible project such as the one that he is — much to his own chagrin — continuing to pursue. His works normally don’t require much from him in terms of continuous attention and calibration. </p><p>There is a vast difference between studying and theorizing about the cultural records and meaning of pictograms and runes copied out from some half-eroded wall deep in the caverns underneath the Temir Mountains and working on the refinement of a process that is time and resource heavy, and cannot truly be paused to be later resumed for any reason without seriously skewing the potential results, or stopped and resumed from the beginning because of a small mistake realized partway through. Al-Haitham can start over a new page when he is working on decrypting or translating a phrase. It is somewhat more costly in time and efforts to restart growing a plant.</p><p>Kaveh grunts, impatient, hand on the door handle and pushing, twisting. </p><p>“Kaveh,” Al-Haitham repeats and Kaveh turns to look at him. Whatever Kaveh sees or hears in Al-Haitham causes him to frown, hand falling as he turns to face Al-Haitham fully to give him time that he does not have. Mehrak, hovering at Kaveh’s side, makes a series of plaintive, worried beeps — as politely as the machine knows how reminding Kaveh of how late he already is. But Kaveh raises his free hand and settles it over Mehrak’s top, firmly pushing the machine down and to the side to silence it. Al-Haitham should probably feel guilty for holding Kaveh back like this.</p><p>“Talk to me,” Kaveh says.</p><p>“When you begin the background research for a build, but are required to test or integrate something unfamiliar, how do you familiarize yourself with the process and account for possible variation that would cause the build to fail, without moving through the process itself?”</p><p>“First of all, this is what simulation and model testing are for. Second, is this about your personal experiment in the courtyard?”</p><p>Al-Haitham simply waits. It should be obvious enough with him answering that question.</p><p>Kaveh’s eyes flick towards the ceiling as he thinks. “Well. This <em>is</em> what all the background research and record checks are for. It doesn’t hurt to look at examples similar to my own situation to see where those others went wrong, or how they later were proved inefficient or otherwise flawed with the development of newer technologies and better understanding of theory. it’s rare that I find an exact one-to-one, but it does help to narrow down possible mistakes before I start. But when I’m starting something new and unfamiliar, there’s no guaranteed way for me to avoid mistakes. I just have to adapt and take the blow on the chin as it comes.”</p><p>This is reasonable enough, and much of what Al-Haitham was anticipating hearing. There are no shortcuts when it comes to experience.</p><p>Al-Haitham nods. Kaveh hesitates before turning back towards the door.</p><p>“If you’re asking these sort of questions, it means you’re doing alright, right?”</p><p>“If you enter the Akademiya through the delivery entrance and go onto the fifth path from the main intersection you’ll be in the Kshahrewar lumber storage zone closest to the studios in fifteen minutes at your jogging speed.”</p><p>Kaveh’s eyes widen, mouth gaping. “You’ve been holding that shortcut out on me<em> this entire time?</em>”</p><p>And then he turns and rips the door open, running. Mehrak shoots off after him. Al-Haitham closes the door quietly and goes to think over this some more while he prepares breakfast.</p><p>-</p><p>Much to Al-Haitham’s disappointment, a messenger comes for him mid-afternoon, bearing a summons to see Lord Kusanali at his earliest convenience. Al-Haitham considers saying that it would not be convenient at all, but he put a lot of work into making sure people looked towards her authority instead of his or the Sage’s, so it wouldn’t do to undermine that. Al-Haitham departs immediately.</p><p>Lord Kusanali is currently in a meeting with the matra and the Sages regarding something he doens’t want to know about. He winds up waiting outside of her office like a boy who’s been called up to see the headmaster. It’s somewhat amusing, especially considering the fact that one of Lord Kusanali’s secretaries keeps shooting him increasingly panicked glances the longer he waits. The staff remain entirely too deferential to him for his tastes.</p><p>It does not take that long for the meeting to adjourn. Perhaps a quarter of an hour after he arrives, the doors to Lord Kusanali’s offices open and Sages and matra and other staff come out, muttering among themselves about whatever business was or was not successfully concluded. Without fail, every time one of them notices him standing there, they stutter in their steps, going wide eyed. Some look suspicious and wary. Others look hopeful. Al-Haitham looks straight ahead and hopes he conveys, as Kaveh often says he does, an air of absolute “infuriating unapproachableness that screams of superiority”. As Al-Haitham has never tried to do this on purpose he cannot tell if he is or is not succeeding.</p><p>The General Mahamatra, his secretary, and second in command are the last to leave. Cyno notices him immediately and waves his people on, walking up to him. Al-Haitham patiently waits for Cyno’s silent examination to draw its own conclusions.</p><p>“Scribe. Official trouble or personal?” Cyno asks.</p><p>“You could not pay me to get into official trouble,” Al-Haitham replies. Under Cyno’s dry stare he amends, grudgingly, “Again.”</p><p>Cyno nods, expression moving more towards curiosity. The man, too, after all, is a scholar of Sumeru. People forget this in their haste to write him off as a policing hand. People are often foolish and reductive. </p><p>“But it <em>is</em> trouble,” Cyno concludes, not sounding very upset about it at all. In fact, Al-Haitham narrows his eyes, Cyno seems amused. An odd thing for the General Mahamatra to be, when a scholar who is frequently called “the lunatic of the Akademiya” is mentioned in the same sentence as “trouble”. Cyno’s pale brows raise up in patient encouragement. “You are you after all, Al-Haitham. I expect brazenness from Tighnari, contradiction from Kaveh, and trouble from you. The only question is if I will be finding out about it through the mouths of others or yours directly.”</p><p>“It should not be something worthy of your attention, General Mahamatra.”</p><p>“If I thought it might be, we would be having a very different conversation right now. What of my attention as Cyno?”</p><p>Al-Haitham sighs, resisting the urge to roll his eyes. Too many people are interested in him as a person lately. Things were so much easier when no one knew him as anything other than an abstract concept of a person who exists.</p><p>“Would it make you more or less curious if I told you that it’s personal in nature and almost entirely a question of philosophy and theory?”</p><p>“More, but I’ll leave you be.” <em>For now,</em> goes unspoken. Cyno nods at him, stepping back and turning away to follow after his matra. “If it becomes trouble, you know where to find me. Do not make me find you. Be well, Al-Haitham. I’ll be seeing you.”</p><p>“I’d rather you didn’t,” Al-Haitham mutters under his breath, fully aware that Cyno probably hears him anyway. </p><p>Lord Kusanali is waiting for him through the doors, looking quite pleased. She always does whenever she spots him and Cyno talking. He’s almost certain that she derives some sort of entertainment from it. He supposes that, if half a year or so ago, if someone told him that he and the General Mahamatra would have such an affable relationship, he too would want to look upon such instances of companionship as the spectacle that they are.</p><p>“You came quickly,” she says, patting the table with her small hand to encourage him to sit across from her. “You’re very eager.”</p><p>“The sooner I begin the sooner I conclude,” Al-Haitham replies. “Lord Kusanali, may I ask why you are so insistent upon this?”</p><p>Lord Kusanali folds her small hands together and looks into him. She is not in his thoughts, he can tell that much, but it feels like she looks at him and reads everything he has to offer anyway, as though he were a book splayed open in clear, large, font, for anyone to glance at and know.</p><p>“Nahida,” she says after her examination of him. “For this, as it is personal and not official business, I believe it would be appropriate to dispense with formalities. You ought to refer to me as Nahida.”</p><p>“Should I?”</p><p>“Yes. It would help to delineate this venture from the other things that I continue to ask of you as your role as a civil servant of Sumeru, which brings me closer to the original question. It is not often that you need help of this nature, Al-Haitham. You can often use more assistance in the form of hands and runners in your work as Scribe, but when it comes to you specifically, there is not much you need. You are simple in this way. It is an admirable and envious quality. It makes you simple and yet hard to understand at the same time, especially when it comes to expressions of gratitude. You’ve done a lot for me, personally. But I find myself at a loss for how to return the favor in like.”</p><p>“The salary was a nice show of thanks.”</p><p>Nahida laughs, youthful face spreading into a charming grin. “Yes, I should hope so. But this is different. As you have often advised me on my personal matters and concerns in the past, I would like to try to do the same to you. Once you advised me that if someone were to offer me assistance that makes my life easier, I ought to take it. I will remind you of this advise to you now.”</p><p>Al-Haitham sighs and settles in to take notes. </p><p>-</p><p>In about one week, Nahida will send to him replacement seed. In the next week he has been charged with further research and further consideration on what, exactly, he is trying to find through this experiment. Writing his findings and thoughts down is optional, as is sharing progress notes with Nahida on any form of scheduled update. If he has something he wants to ask or talk through he may call on her, but she will not further interfere from this point onwards. This is an experiment that seeks to ask questions of himself, after all.</p><p>Al-Haitham considers his next move as he moves through the route work of Scribe for the rest of the afternoon until his office hours end. He makes his escape from the Akademiya in order to wander through the streets of Sumeru as he gathers his thoughts. </p><p>He had once told Dehya that in order to study something one must observe it. It is easy enough to observe plants and nature in Sumeru, even within the city’s walls. But Al-Haitham does not need to observe something in its maturity. What he needs is observation of the growth, the process that takes the seed to sprout to tree, bush, shrub, flower, vine. And yet, Al-Haitham cannot study a plant in the process of its growth when he cannot, himself, get anything to grow. Nor does it help him to see the finished result without understanding of the process taken to get there. It’s a closed loop.</p><p>Therefore what Al-Haitham must do is seek out someone else who has seen things grow, and has been the cause of that growth, and can advise him on the process. This returns him to Kaveh’s advice and his own prior conclusion, although with slightly more direction.</p><p>Seeing as Kaveh got both this idea and the seeds from their neighbors, it seems fitting for Al-Haitham to turn to them as well. </p><p>Course of action now charted, Al-Haitham turns about-face and starts walking home.</p><p>He knocks twice on Nour Aunt’s door. Upon answering she squints up at him suspiciously again, slowly looking him over from head to foot and finding whatever she’s capable of seeing with her poor eyesight lacking.</p><p>“You’re hungry.”</p><p>“In a manner of speaking. I have questions for you, Nour Aunt, if you’re available.”</p><p>Nour Aunt turns around and gestures him inside. “Of course you do. Inside, inside.”</p><p>Nour Aunt had been in the middle of cooking what appears to be, for the average family of four or five, a full meal. Instead, he has a feeling that all of this will be directed at her single nephew who’s currently studying under the Vahumana. She always bemoans how the man is getting thicker about the waist every time he gets new uniforms done up, but perhaps upon self-reflection she would realize it’s because she’s feeding the man enough for five. Al-Haitham is not going to say this to her face because he wants to leave for home sometime this week.</p><p>She gestures him over to her and then for him to hold out his hands to her. She squints down at them before deciding they must pass inspection because she directs him to washing them at the sink.</p><p>“I’ve been told that you are decent at baking by your Kaveh,” she says as she takes up her cleaver to return to slowly cutting vegetables at her kitchen table. Al-Haitham has long given up on the fight to get her to stop calling Kaveh his, and calling him Kaveh’s. “The dough is ready. Get to work on that, and if it’s good, I will trust you with preparing the chutney. What are your questions?”</p><p>Al-Haitham tells her of the seeds and how they withered. He tells her of the types of soil compositions he’d tried, the watering schedule, and the various places he had tried moving the plants when he thought that perhaps it was the level of sun and heat that got to them. She has him describe to her what the seeds that did manage to sprout looked like when they died and she has him describe the pots that they were in.</p><p>“It was not the light,” she determines as she watches him slide rounds of bread out of the pan onto the waiting basket and cloth to cool. The bread must pass muster because she sets him on cutting vegetables for chutney next, as she takes over at the stove to heat oil for a giant bag of peanuts that she pulls out from somewhere. “Your house has perfect lighting for growing.”</p><p>He wonders how she gathered that from one visit.</p><p>“Before your house was built there,” she continues, “It was an excellent plot that was constantly growing with grass and moss and all the usual things one sees within spitting distance in the fields when they are left to their own devices. When your house was built, I remember we were all very curious about what would happen. We have all been very envious of the lighting you get.”</p><p>“We?”</p><p>“We,” she confirms. “We had all been curious about what you had been doing in that house, you know. It’s a waste of it to go without greenery for so long. Aren’t you a son of Sumeru?”</p><p>Al-Haitham sighs.</p><p>“In any case, it is not a problem with the light,” she continues as she waits for the oil to heat to fry the peanuts. “I confirmed that myself when I was over there last. When these peanuts are done we will walk down to Sarath’s. We will get you more seeds and more pots from him because that man is a hoarder who doesn’t know how to get go of anything. And we shall ask him for his advice because he only started focusing on his gardening after he retired and now he thinks he knows everything. It would be good for him to talk to someone who knows nothing so he realizes how little he knows. Watch, we will make you a proper son of Sumeru, yet. And when Sarath starts complaining at me about his granddaughter not trying hard enough to get into the Akademiya, I am going to tell him that you are from the Akademiya and look at what <em>that</em> got you, and he’ll finally shut up about it. Are we agreed? Yes? Good. Do you and your Kaveh want peanuts? Of course you do. Tell that boy if I see him running past my house like he is on fire one more time I am going to buy him a clock. What business does he have being late so early in the morning? Learn time management. Tell him that. I’ll ask him and you the next time I see you to make sure.”</p><p>By the time Al-Haitham returns home — arms loaded down with fried peanuts, pakoras that have not yet been fried, several new packets seeds, second-hand gardening tools, and for reasons he still can’t quite understand, several meters worth of sugarcane cut up and tied together — he is unreasonably exhausted. Kaveh’s shoes are by the door and his keys are in the bowl. As Al-Haitham leaves the peanuts and sugar-cane on the kitchen table and goes to the courtyard to put down the rest of his new tools, he hears the sound of water running through the pipes in the washroom.</p><p>When Al-Haitham is done sorting out seeds, soil, tools, and pots, Kaveh is standing in the kitchen looking down at the bound sugarcane, the pakoras, and the peanuts.</p><p>He glances up at Al-Haitham and points at the sugarcane. “You went to see Sarath Uncle. Are you <em>dying</em>? What’s the matter with you? What are you up to? Are the pakoras his work too?”</p><p>“Nour Aunt,” Al-Haitham corrects, going to fetch a pan and oil to fry the pakoras. There’s plain potato ones, some with other mixed vegetables, and a few with strips of chicken mixed into the batter. He cannot tell which are which. “Research.”</p><p>“Research?” Kaveh narrows his eyes. “The same research?”</p><p>Al-Haitham nods. Kaveh sighs, clicking his tongue. “Alright, then. Any closer to sharing your findings?”</p><p>“The initial conclusion requires further testing.”</p><p>“Does this have anything to do with your visit to Lord Kusanali?”</p><p>Al-Haitham shoots a sharp look over his shoulder at Kaveh. Kaveh has sat himself down at the table and is snacking on the fried peanuts. He gives Al-Haitham what Al-Haitham is sure Kaveh thinks is an innocent look.</p><p>“People talk about you.” Kaveh pops a peanut into his mouth, red eyes dancing in the warm lights of the kitchen. </p><p>People talk about the Acting Grand Sage, which he no longer is, and the Scribe. Sometimes “the lunatic”. They do not talk about Al-Haitham. This is exactly how he prefers it.</p><p>“You talk about me.”</p><p>Kaveh acknowledges this with a dip of his head, licking salt off of his thumb. He concedes this point easily, <em>disarmingly</em> easily. Half a year ago, Kaveh would have sputtered and blustered his way through half-a-denial, half-an-excuse, and then finally an admission. A year ago, Kaveh would have rolled his eyes and sneered. A year before that they would not be talking like this at all. </p><p>“Yes. And because <em>everyone</em> knows that I know you better than most, everyone talks to me about you. Besides that, I talked to Cyno before leaving the Akademiya and he mentioned it to me, too. He’s curious. I’m curious. You’re contagious, I think. Except this is Sumeru and all scholars are gossips except for, maybe, Tighnari. But that’s because he wishes we would all shut up and give him a moment of peace to mind his own business instead of dealing with our messes. So. What’s the man of mystery up to now? All this secrecy and build up just makes the intrigue more titillating, you know.”</p><p>“Keep your expectations to yourself,” Al-Haitham says, turning back towards the stove. “You are all making this out into something much bigger than it needs to be.”</p><p>“It’s you, after all,” Kaveh replies dismissively. People keep saying this, Al-Haitham is not sure if it means what he thought it means anymore. He stands with a slow sigh. Al-Haitham hears the man grunt as he stretches. “Go bathe and change. I’ll take care of the pakoras and maybe the sugarcane. Probably not the sugarcane. That can wait. I haven’t eaten dinner yet though, and freshly fried pakoras seems like an excellent idea right about now. Fried food is always good when you’re tired.”</p><p>“And now <em>you’re</em> up to something. I don’t think this house will survive<em> the both of us</em> being up to something.” Al-Haitham says this, but moves aside easily, grateful for a moment to rally his thoughts and be by himself for a while.</p><p>“I can’t be nice to you because I feel sorry for you being dragged around between our neighbors like a bone between dogs?” Kaveh teases. “No, I’ve got to pick your brain about ideas for one of my projects and I’m not getting anything out of you if you’re dead tired and itching for a bath. Get that done and come back. And bring out Mehrak to record, it’s charging right now. I might have overdone it earlier today, poor thing’s slowed down quite a bit and was somewhat overheated. I’ll be borrowing your grandmother’s journals on machine cooling systems again, by the by.”</p><p>-</p><p>Al-Haitham emerges from the bath feeling much refreshed, if not entirely recovered from an entire afternoon of being talked at and over and around. The pakoras are arranged on a wide platter, the fried peanuts poured into a large bowl, the sugarcane leaned against a wall, and two cups of wine are sitting and waiting. His mood turns up incrementally.</p><p>The two of them sit, eating and drinking cheap wine. The sort of wine that they keep around for nights exactly like this, when they are too lazy and too easy with each other; when they don’t want to eat but don’t want to not eat; when they want to stay together but feel as though they need an excuse to even though they are both fully aware that they do not. They eat the peanuts and the pakoras, getting oil and salt on their fingers and smeared across the metal of their cups. The wine is bitter and sour but it’s good — it cuts through the oil of the fried and battered vegetables and the salt of the peanuts. </p><p>They both glance at the sugarcane and mutually decide that it isn’t worth it right now, and go back to ignoring the bundle as a problem for their future selves.</p><p>Kaveh asks Al-Haitham how Nour Aunt finally caught and reeled him in for a lecture. Apparently she’s been trying to get at him for months now. Something or other about his job prospects and his thin cheeks and so on and so forth. Al-Haitham admits that he went over to her. Kaveh looks stunned by the correction before bursting out into laughter. </p><p>It is not mean laughter. Al-Haitham knows what that looks like and this is not it. This laughter billows outward, light and robust. Kaveh’s face, from drink and good humor, is rosy. His eyes are bright. Al-Haitham watches Kaveh’s hair, distracting as it is — pulled entirely back from his face and shoulders, bound at the back of his head and swaying with every movement. </p><p>However, despite the joviality of the moment, Al-Haitham can see the weariness where its hold on the other man remains strong. Kaveh has lost weight, his already loose clothes even looser than before. While before Kaveh would call it a personal preference, a fashion statement, Al-Haitham would argue that now it’s a matter of ill-fit. Kaveh’s lips are chapped, bitten and picked at, as are the edges of his nails and cuticles. The wine and the food and the humor of Al-Haitham’s misfortune have temporarily bolstered Kaveh for the evening, perhaps only even for the moment. But it is a temporary patch over a greater wound that Al-Haitham cannot even begin to address.</p><p>Perhaps it is selfish of him, but Al-Haitham does not <em>want</em> to address that wound tonight. Not tonight. Tonight the wine is cheap and good, the food is fresh and warm, and Kaveh is laughing like light. Al-Haitham has put his earphones away and his shoulders feel relaxed. Al-Haitham’s head is clear, despite the wine, and his entire body feels good. Harmonious. It is a good night. He would like to enjoy it for as long as he is permitted, even if it means holding his tongue on the subject.</p><p>“Now that you’ve gone over to see them, you realize that you’ll never have a moment of peace, yes?” Kaveh pauses, eyes going wide. “Sevens.<em> I’ll</em> never have a moment of peace. You’ve opened the gates.”</p><p>As Kaveh predicted, their neighbors start pulling him aside, calling out to him more readily whenever they spot him, be it on the street they share, the market, or other areas of Sumeru. Some of these meetings are brief — mere greetings or nods of the head. Some are inexplicably long. Al-Haitham is honestly surprised that any of them would <em>want</em> to seek him out — he’s made no attempts at being particularly good company, and most of the topics of prolonged conversation are ones he has no proficiency in to contribute much of anything one way or another. But he indulges it (tolerates it) to the best of his ability. It is not too much of an annoyance. It seems like the entire street knows that he is now attempting a garden and everyone has opinions on it. Some of which are very helpful, others confusing, and several in contraction to each other. But Al-Haitham notes all of it down mentally to test and study. </p><p>Several of their neighbors pass him seeds and cuttings with advice, spare pots, offers of fertilizer, and anecdotes that are more amusing than actually helpful. Al-Haitham refuses none of it, which causes many of them to look extremely relieved and satisfied, as though they’ve played a trick on him by getting him to take their things. He’s unsure of why this is, exactly, and can only think that it’s something he might come to understand if he ever succeeds in growing anything. </p><p>Nour has invited herself over twice now to inspect the courtyard. She is able to, instantly, identify exactly who each seed and cutting came from, despite her poor vision. Al-Haitham really wants to set her loose in the matra and see how this cuts down on Cyno’s work load. They could eradicate the entire backlog from five hundred years worth of systematic corruption in a week or less, he’s sure. Nour provides helpful clarification on the conflicting stories and advice he’s been told, although he’s not sure if he should be listening to her over the others. He mentally notes this down too.</p><p>She also brings him an entire dish of gajar halwa that he wastes no time in foisting off onto Kaveh, to split with Cyno, who will — he assumes — share with Lord Kusanali.</p><p>By the end of the week, Al-Haitham has more than enough to form a proper garden although he lacks the experience and the affinity for such a thing. He feels, <em>almost</em>, sorry for the effort everyone seems to have put into this even though he has yet to begin.</p><p>Early in the morning as Al-Haitham is waiting for his coffee to wake him up fully — Kaveh already gone off to do something, somewhere, for some amount of mora that is <em>not</em> zero but is certainly below what it should be, unlikely to return before nightfall — there’s a brisk knock on the door. He does not recognize the knock. If this was a a week or so ago, he would think it simply a courier because he never expects anyone to visit. After this past week of being talked at by too many people, he recognizes that it could be anyone. He wonders if it’s worth it to ignore the knocking. Then whoever it is on the other side knocks again, firmer and twice.</p><p>Dehya, on the other side of the door, looks like she’s trying not to laugh.</p><p>“Did you just wake up?” She says. Al-Haitham grunts, eyes lowered towards her arms. </p><p>“I didn’t tell you where I live.”</p><p>She indicates the packages in her arms. “I’m on a commission from the Archon. I brought something from her. Seeds. She didn’t tell me what sort or what they’re for, although I’m pretty sure there’s only one thing a person does with seeds. She also said that she’s looking forward to your report. Are you awake or asleep?”</p><p>“I want to be one but am unfortunately the other,” he says, running a hand over his face, standing aside for her to enter. Dehya laughs. Like Kaveh she does not laugh to be cruel or mean. Like Kaveh, her laugh is light. Al-Haitham finds some small curl of pleased warmth in him at causing that laugh, although he is not sure why she is laughing. Waking up so early on a day off is an annoyance no matter how one looks at it.</p><p>“So, gardening? Can I see?”</p><p>Al-Haitham shrugs, walking past her to unlatch and push open the windows on the far side of the front room to expose the empty courtyard. </p><p>Well. It is not so empty now. Over the past week he’s been given an inordinate amount of things to clutter the space — ranging from pots, half-empty bags of soil and fertilizer and sand, cuttings from a whole range of plants, and gardening tools. He has not yet started on anything but it’s all there. But the space, now, has a sense of <em>purpose</em> — not barren, but transitioning between one thing to another as it accommodates for its new role. </p><p>Kaveh’s plants at least, are doing well. One would not think that they were on the verge of death a mere couple of weeks ago. Dehya takes it in, expression softening as she moves to follow him through the front room into the kitchen and out into the courtyard itself to put down her delivery.</p><p>Dehya walks around the small space, leaning in to inspect different cuttings. Al-Haitham leans against the door jamb, eyes half-closed.</p><p>“You know, between you and your roommate, I would not have thought you to be the one who puts his hand towards gardening,” she says as she finishes her first circuit of the small space, reminding Al-Haitham of a tiger in the cage. Between the various things he’d been given and Dehya, the space seems smaller, more alive. The wonders of perception.</p><p>Al-Haitham also wonders how many people, now, know of Kaveh’s living here. Kaveh doesn’t seem to mind their neighbors knowing, mostly because their neighbors don’t care or know much about Kaveh the Master Architect, genius of the generation. It seems that they’ll find fault with Kaveh based on simpler things like the fact that they strongly disapprove of Kaveh’s wardrobe choices, his ability to pick out good produce, and his inability to tolerate stronger levels of spice. They could not care less about Kaveh’s accolades. </p><p>Kaveh has, recently, opened up more to their growing circle of mutual acquaintances to let slip some of his circumstance, even if none of them except for Al-Haitham know the fullest picture of it. He’s not sure how or why Kaveh made peace with the idea of being known as living here, but he’s somewhat relieved that it’s finally happened. Al-Haitham vaguely understood why Kaveh was so resentful and fretful of it being known, but he never agreed with any of those reasons and has been admittedly half-hearted about not directly mentioning Kaveh’s name alongside his own when it comes to the topic of roommates. </p><p>At the very least, Kaveh’s no longer putting Al-Haitham’s name down as the recipient for the most inane and ludicrous of purchases.</p><p>“You Akademiya lot surprise me,” Dehya continues when Al-Haitham doesn’t respond. “I think those of us from beyond the Wall often get irritated about being put into these molds, these caricatures, by the forest-dwelling side. It’s not particularly <em>fair</em>, but I think that’s just what people do. Again. Not an excuse. Anyway. You surprise me, Al-Haitham. You and the rest of our friends from the Akademiya. Kaveh, Layla, Tighnari. Every time I think I kind of get any of you, you turn around and do something that makes me think again. You make me ask questions.”</p><p>“Want to join yet?”</p><p>Dehya shakes her head, grinning as she takes up another bundle of sugarcane that was somehow put into Al-Haitham’s hands before he could figure out a way to refuse it. She spins the sugarcane around like a staff, easy and comfortable as she looks around once more.</p><p>“Why the sudden interest though? I guess I am a Sumeru brat after all, or maybe you’re just infectious. Like I said, you don’t really seem the type to go in for this sort of thing. I’m not either — I leave this kind of thing to Lady Dunyarzad and Nilou.”</p><p>There are a few reasons why. Curiosity drives most of them. Al-Haitham is not quite ready to speak of the deeper one just yet, but the shallower one that caught his interest first is easy enough to speak of.</p><p>“A short time ago, I found myself feeling restless. I found that there was a certain sort of…calm that could ease the restlessness in the activity, and I am trying to see if it was a one time occurrence due to the novelty of it, or something that will continue to produce the same effect. I recognize how unsuitable it is for me, as this is not within my character, but I think that this can be excused as a necessary going against the grain in the name of self-awareness.”</p><p>Dehya wrinkles her nose. “You have a very, <em>very</em> complicated way of saying things. What do you mean by <em>unsuitable</em>?”</p><p>“You said it yourself, it is not like me to take an interest in this sort of thing. You aren’t wrong. It’s an astute observation. Those plants over there are Kaveh’s.” </p><p>“It’s different for you, but that doesn’t mean it’s not <em>suitable</em>,” Dehya frowns. “Who said it was unsuitable? Don’t go putting words in my mouth that I don’t mean, Al-Haitham. I’m just surprised, is all. Besides. Who cares if it’s suitable or not? Who decides that for a person? I didn’t think you, of all people, would care about that kind of thing.”</p><p>“I might not care, but I do notice it and take it into account when I consider the things I do. In any case, it is unlikely that any of this will amount to anything.”</p><p>Dehya taps the sugar cane bundle against her open palm. Her eyes sharpen, taking on that keenness they have when she is assessing someone or something — like when he stopped to look at the crystal flies.</p><p>“Who says it wouldn’t? Hey, you know I love make up and dresses and styling my hair and getting my nails done, right?” Al-Haitham nods, not quite sure why she’s bringing this up. He’s listened to her complain about not finding the right treatments for her hair when she’s in Sumeru City plenty of times. She’s often shown to him the newest patterns she’s gotten done on her hands, her nails, with joyful pride. Al-Haitham does not have experience in either of these topics, but he does find enjoyment in listening her tell him of them. “There are those who would say it is unsuitable for me, the Flame-Mane mercenary, to be interested in things like that. I understand what you mean when it comes to character and perceptions and stuff like that. But just because it is not what I am mainly known for doesn’t mean I can’t have it, can’t enjoy it, you know? Just because you and I are known for other stuff doesn’t mean we can’t enjoy or pursue different things than those things. And whether or not you’re good at it — if you’re happy, if it makes you feel good, then <em>that’s</em> what really matters. You know that, don’t you?”</p><p>For Dehya he would agree. For himself, he has a few more questions. Especially because he has already proven himself below adept at this over the past few weeks of trying to grow things. But this is not something he wants to debate about. Besides, he did tell Nahida that he would make a few more attempts.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Dehya’s blue eyes examine him for another beat before she sighs, shaking her head. “See for yourself then, I guess. You’re either being stubborn, willful, or you’re just that asleep still. Alright, I’ll get out of your hair. Don’t sleep the entire day away. Tell Layla and Cyno that I said hello next time you see them. I’m taking this sugarcane. You’re welcome.”</p><p>-</p><p>Following the guidance he’s been given, however conflicting in some cases, Al-Haitham begins to plant. Most of the seeds and cuttings he’d been given are simple enough in theory. As before, Al-Haitham notes how peaceful it is to mix the soil, to tamp it down, and to place each seed and cover it. If anything at least he has proven that this part is consistently having the same effect on him. Shame that he can’t just mix and sift soil and sand and stones over and over again.</p><p>Within a few days the first few seeds begin to sprout through. Not all of them, but some of them. As with before, a few don’t quite make it out. But with the new advice given, and with Nour Aunt inventing herself over to inspect his progress, inviting with her some of their other neighbors now and again, more successfully sprout and begin to shoot upwards than before. Some he still has to restart, but he has plenty of seeds and an entire variety of things to experiment with.</p><p>Slowly the seeds and the cuttings in their various forms and stages, take root. Al-Haitham half expects to glance upon them and find them withering up and dead, but day after day he only sees positive progress. More sprouts survive than the ones that die. Some cuttings don’t quite make it, but this can be attributed to any number of factors that may or may not be Al-Haitham’s fault.</p><p>As Al-Haitham tends to each pot, each cutting, each plant, he finds a new and strange sort of peace settling over him. There is truly something soothing about this specific labor. It quiets his mind and eases it. There is a satisfaction here that he is not used to.</p><p>There is a specific sort of satisfaction here that he gains from tending to these plants, from watching them grow stronger and more stable with every passing day. Plants are simple. Their problems are often simple in nature and it is getting easier for him to understand how to identify them the more that he works at it, the more that he listens and observes. For all that Al-Haitham is a student of languages, here is one that he has not touched upon nearly at all in all of his years of living despite its near universal presence all around him. Better late than never, he supposes.</p><p>Al-Haitham is learning to recognize what burns translate to on a plant — dehydration, rot, lack of proper nutrients, dissatisfaction with light or soil, upset due to pests, and all sorts of other forms of sickness and disease. This process of learning, of translating, of adapting, excites him.</p><p>It has been a very long time since Al-Haitham has had the opportunity to learn something from scratch, with this level of trial and error. It has been a long time since he has had the opportunity to partake in this sort of satisfying challenge that demands he rise up to meet it.</p><p>Everything is still in its fledgling stages, but he thinks he is at least past the point of worrying about everything dying out instantly. The plants have settled into their growing, their spreading out to fill their allocated spaces of soil and stone, clay and ceramic. Al-Haitham even finds himself cautiously optimistic about it. He even finds himself growing slightly attached to the tender and soft green-white sprouts that have succeeded in growing tall without crushing themselves or getting entangled with their immediate neighbors.</p><p>One evening, Al-Haitham returns from dinner with Layla, that is to say, eating in the Akademiya’s mess hall, the two of them going over her latest revision of her thesis as he presents to her possible questions and arguments she may face during her thesis defense and offering her advice on how to best phrase her rebuttals. She is much improved from when they first started at this, although she sometimes falls into lapses of self-doubt that cause her to overthink things too much. The professors in charge of the thesis defense expect mastery on the subject and expression of familiarity; they do not expect her to be the leading expert in everything possibly related to the topic with a neat and tidy answer for every problem to ever exist. This is something that she sometimes forgets when it takes her a beat too long to answer a question. Especially when the questions <em>seems</em> to cover something basic that she would already know, even if it is not. Al-Haitham finds the door to the courtyard open, the light of the kitchen painting a rectangle onto the stone with soft borders against the dark. Kaveh stands, just beyond that soft border, weight leaning on one leg, arms crossed, head tipped towards the rectangle of sky framed by the roof of the house and the Divine Tree.</p><p>Al-Haitham walks around the edges of the courtyard, inspecting the plants by the dim and colored light coming in through the windows and from the door. One day should not send them all to ruin, not like before. But it has become a habit of his, now, to check on them when he wakes and when he returns, and one final time before sleep. Every time he lays eyes on them something in him finds satisfaction to a problem, and irritant, he was somehow unaware of until it was soothed.</p><p>Kaveh is, as always, tired looking. But he also looks serious. This anxiousness breathes new energy into him. His mouth is pressed into a tight line and his brows are drawn downwards, a deep furrow between them. His fingers are curled tight against his arms. Al-Haitham is familiar with this particular expression of Kaveh’s. It is the one that he has when is confronted with something unpalatable, but this bitter thing must be swallowed and choked down none-the-less; when he is about to do something that he doesn’t want to do but knows he must in order to move forward. Because Kaveh is <em>Kaveh</em>, tired or not, he <em>will</em> do it because he is a man who only ever moves forward. Kaveh may be dogged by regrets and mistakes, but it has never stopped him from inching onwards into the future unknown. </p><p>This quality of Kaveh and his troubles is one that Al-Haitham cannot, and <em>would</em> not, critique.</p><p>“I was coming out to toss out some trash,” Kaveh begins as Al-Haitham is pressing his finger into the soil of a pot of chickpea to test if it’s gone dry. “And to take a pause in my grading. There are only <em>so</em> many paragraphs on a subject I assigned my students to researching I can read over at any given time before I feel my eyes go cross. I haven’t the slightest idea how you do this all day. I know you said you were working out here, but I didn’t realize you were doing so much. Honestly, I have no idea <em>what</em> I thought you were doing when you told me that you were working on an experiment. It wasn’t <em>this</em> though.”</p><p>“I used up your seeds,” Al-Haitham tells him. And then, when Kaveh does not say anything, he adds on, “They died. If these ones grow you can take your pick.”</p><p>Kaveh’s eyes flick towards him, briefly moved out of their levity. “Thanks. But you’re probably going to do better with them than I would. Don’t look so overjoyed about it, but you were right. I really — “</p><p>Kaveh cuts himself off, that contemplative and solemn mood returning as he looks away again, mouth closing on whatever it was he was going to say. Al-Haitham waits. If Kaveh doesn’t say whatever it is he’ll leave. Trying to wait Kaveh out is an exercise in patience that Al-Haitham struggles with even when he knows the source of Kaveh’s turmoil. When Al-Haitham is blind like this, it’s just too variable. He’d rather not fight tonight. </p><p>Frankly, he doesn’t want to fight with Kaveh like this <em>at all</em>. There’s nothing to be <em>gained</em> from their emotional battles. Battles of facts and philosophy and such, yes. Those are fertile grounds for ideas and questions and lines of thought. But not <em>these</em> sort. There’s just hurt. Just wounds. Yes, there’s room for growth with the hurt. But Al-Haitham, no matter what others may think of him, really is <em>just a man</em> as any other. If he can avoid hurt he will.</p><p>Just as Al-Haitham is moving past Kaveh to go back inside Kaveh breathes in. Deep. Long. Loud. Bracing for impact.</p><p>“In a few years I will be older than my father ever was.”</p><p>Al-Haitham goes still, looking into the rectangle of light framed by the shadows of the door frame. Through the light Al-Haitham can see the kitchen table. Past that he can see the open door that leads out into their front room.</p><p>“I have been thinking,” Kaveh continues slowly, “Of potential. Of the self.”</p><p>Al-Haitham turns, eyes narrowing. For all that the two of them disagree on most things, it is truly uncanny how closely aligned they fall in with each other. Even like this. <em>Especially</em> like this.</p><p>Kaveh’s shoulders flex, rolling restlessly as he shifts his weight from one foot slowly to the other. “I have been thinking about who I am and where I am; who I want to be and where I want to be. I ask myself, all of this work, what do I have to show for it?”</p><p>If Al-Haitham were a different Al-Haitham, the one of a few months ago, a few years ago, he would say — meanly with the lingering resentment of hurt and a heartache that surprises him to this day with how deeply it reached — <em>Your beloved ideals.</em></p><p>But Al-Haitham is not that man. He is not that boy. He has learned. He is different. The wound of that day, that battle, made him change. <em>Forced</em> him to change.</p><p>Whether Kaveh actually wants an answer or not, Al-Haitham gives one anyway, “You have yourself, Kaveh. You have your integrity. You have the job that you had quietly hoped for and you have proof of your dreams being loved.”</p><p>Kaveh shakes his head, hair muted and darkened by the night. His voice, however, is light. Painfully so. Al-Haitham is not the only one who has learned through injury.</p><p>“Are they? Loved?”</p><p>Kaveh is not the sort of man who chases flattery, nor is Al-Haitham the sort who gives it. Al-Haitham studies the hard and brittle set of Kaveh’s shoulders. Here is where Kaveh expects Al-Haitham to be a blunt force against his easy-to-shatter self. Al-Haitham would expect it, too. But in this case, the truth Al-Haitham’s mouth holds is not a denial.</p><p>“The paint on the bridge of Port Ormos has been refreshed twice since you lay hands on that city.”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“Don’t fish for compliments. There is no reason for a bridge to require that much aesthetic-only upkeep in such a short amount of time. But your bridge is admired and loved. Its paint has been worn down by so many hands and feet that it needed that care. To the north, Alcazarzaray commands respect with just the name alone. There are students who verge on idolatry when they speak of you and the things you have created. That’s why your class is what it is. And the only reason you have not been unanimously voted in as Sage is because you aren’t done yet. You aren’t finished with your work, you are not yet satisfied with what you have done, and you are still thinking of what you have yet to do. Am I wrong?”</p><p>Kaveh has turned to face him, expression disconcertingly blank as Al-Haitham speaks. Until that last sentence, that last question, where his mouth breaks into one of those sharp smiles with all of the edges pointed inward.</p><p>“Sometimes you say the most lovely things. And you’re so damned sincere about it that I don’t know what to do about it. About <em>you</em>. Al-Haitham. I have been thinking recently. There are some things I think I need to change. I <em>know</em> I need to change. About myself. It’s going to be awfully unpleasant. I’m going to hate it. But I think it’s necessary. I <em>know</em> it’s necessary.”</p><p>“Agreed.”</p><p>“Don’t ruin the moment.” Kaveh clicks his tongue against his teeth, eyes narrowing. He runs a frustrated hand through his hair, eyes momentarily closing before he looks at Al-Haitham again. Sometimes Kaveh, when troubled, looks at Al-Haitham as though <em>Al-Haitham</em> were the source of his troubles, despite Al-Haitham having nothing to do with the matter except having stumbled upon Kaveh in the moments when he needs to confront the issue. In these situations, Al-Haitham’s only crime is that he is present to witness it. Just like now. “I am in a peculiar mood. I am exhausted. I have come to realize that I will never stop growing, Al-Haitham. Changing. I do not think I will ever be that perfect self I thought I was supposed to be. I keep thinking about <em>how</em> I’m supposed to be — I’m <em>supposed</em> to be something better than what I am yet when I stop to think about it, I don’t know <em>what</em>, exactly, that better self is supposed to be. Because that better self is made by doing all of these things that I know I would regret; the things that would sacrifice my ideals and my integrity both. So I must then ask of the expectations of that perfect self: <em>who</em> set them?<em> I</em> did. <em>Why</em> did I set them? <em>How</em> did I conclude that those were the parameters for success? What did I work for, for so long? <em>Who</em> did I work for? <em>Who</em> did I fail? <em>Who</em> judged me as falling short?”</p><p>Kaveh’s hands curl into fists, eyes closing. </p><p>“For the longest time I thought it was all some fault within me, some inherent thing that I had to make up for and work around. Just this <em>thing</em> I had to overcome. <em>I</em> was the one, I thought, that was falling short. And it has drained me. <em>Exhausted</em> me. For years and years and <em>years</em>. But it wasn’t <em>me</em>. I can’t believe I’m <em>just</em> starting to understand this, <em>really</em> understand this, now. I mean — well. <em>This</em> assumption was me. But the inherent flaw was imagined. I <em>created</em> it, this thing that does not exist, and allowed it to hold onto me for so many…”</p><p>Here, Kaveh’s voice fails him as he puts his hand to his head, covering his eyes, head bowing under the weight of this realization.</p><p>Al-Haitham could have told him all of this. He probably has, over the years, attempted to bring it up. But there are some things that can only be broken through from the inside.</p><p>“What’s caused you to think all of this?”</p><p>Kaveh laughs, quiet and rough. “A lot of time in my own head, which — considering the issue, one would think wouldn’t be the solution here. But no. A lot of time by myself is what did it. Catalyzed with interactions with my students. And some more talking with certain other persons. Al-Haitham,” Kaveh raises his head but looks off to the side, mouth twisted into a sharp and sour shape, “I think it really only hit me when I was looking at this experiment of yours. This is something about yourself, the world, that you have always known and accepted, isn’t it? Expectation and potential — perception.”</p><p>Kaveh laughs again, brighter, but no less raw and rough. He still is not looking at Al-Haitham, but off into the dark, into his own thoughts.</p><p>“We often talk about you as slightly out of touch, off on your own, with only gods-knows-what going through your head. But it’s times like these where I’m reminded that you’re leagues ahead of the rest of us. Me. I’m so behind in this aspect compared to you. I want to be upset about it, you know? But at the end of it all, I can only feel admiration for you.”</p><p>The admission is too raw, too vulnerable. Al-Haitham does not know what to do with this, if he’s supposed to do anything with it. So Al-Haitham tells Kaveh as much. “And what am I to do with <em>your</em> sincerity? What are <em>you</em> going to do with it, Kaveh?”</p><p>Kaveh shrugs. The brief and innocuous action is too light for this conversation. But Al-Haitham cannot push for what isn’t there, for what Kaveh isn’t ready to give freely. So he waits for Kaveh to rally himself.</p><p>Finally, Kaveh looks at him. Directly at him. His voice is calmer, gentler, when he speaks again.</p><p>“Do you enjoy it?”</p><p>Al-Haitham looks away from Kaveh to look at the shadowed and strangely colored courtyard —  gold and green colored light contained by sharp lines of bruise-colored night. There is much work to be done, still. All things considered, Al-Haitham has done barely anything. Everything, aside from what Kaveh had started months and months ago, is in its early stages, looking spindly and meager in comparison to the thriving, matured trio by the window. In this it is Al-Haitham who is leagues behind Kaveh, the rest of Sumeru. He’s fairly certain that children in primary schools are better at this than he is, and are capable of approaching this without the support of a literal Archon, an entire street of busy-bodies, and copious amounts of research.</p><p>But still — he has observed the effects this activity has had on his own mind, his temperament. His current experiment asks multiple questions of him, and whether this is something he enjoys or not is one of them, but not the one he is primarily concerned about. His enjoyment is secondary towards his questions of capability, his potential, and if it consistently provides the same level of soothing effect and if so at which stages of the theoretical process of gardening, cultivating.</p><p>Does he <em>enjoy</em> it though? Parts of it <em>do</em> generate more pleasure than others, he supposes. But is that consistent or just because it’s new to him? Is it novelty? Will this fade with future success or failure? Is he the type of person who derives enjoyment from the act of care or the result itself?</p><p>Al-Haitham cannot put all of this to word. Not yet. It all sits ungainly in his mouth, tangled in itself like a snake trapped between skins — not free, not bound, not old, not new. He does not know the cleanest words for this, the phrasing that will make this easy to digest. </p><p>So he shrugs. Over twenty languages in his head and he doesn’t have the words for this. That’s frustrating. But language has failed him several times over in his life, and at this stage of things he should have gotten over that particular frustration. Al-Haitham recognizes this, too, as another thing that has changed about him. The acknowledgement of the change should be pacifying, but it is not.</p><p>Kaveh’s expression softens, hands falling loosely to his sides.</p><p>“Well,” he says when Al-Haitham just stands there, unable to answer, “I do not know what your experiment is supposed to be about, but whatever it is that you’re doing here suits you.” Kaveh smiles again, still tired, but this is a smile turned outward. This is a kind smile, an offering. And this time, it is one Al-Haitham can return.</p><p>He holds his hand out, beckoning Kaveh into the light of the open kitchen door. Kaveh steps forward, the warm yellow light returning color to his shape as he slides his fingers through Al-Haitham’s. Kaveh’s hands are always cool, despite the warmth of Sumeru. Their hands close around each other and Al-Haitham pulls Kaveh after him, back into the house.</p><p>“And what you are doing suits you.”</p>

<p>Chapter Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>In a quiet moment after the twice a month meeting between Lord Kusanali and the upper management of the Mahamata ranks, Nahida asks Al-Haitham about his experiment findings thus far. Al-Haitham, in the middle of straightening his notes and mentally reviewing all the ways he can get his new assignments done as fast as possible without actually interacting with any of the rest of his Mahamata cohort, tells her about the incoming flux of produce he’s seen and the strange ongoing war of harvest the entire street has fallen to. Nahida listens with rapt attention, laughter, awe, and polite confusion in her face as she nods along with his brief explanation of the situation he’s found himself unwillingly roped into.</p><p>“Are you excited for your vegetables to get ripe because you would count it as a personal success, or because you want to take part in this…war? There certainly has to be a better word for it than <i>war</i>, Al-Haitham.”</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>As things begin to take root, Al-Haitham feels anxieties he was not aware of ease as the excitement and curiosity overtake them; turning them mild, evaporating into inconsequential nothingness them before he can fully grasp what they were to understand them. These feelings are fed by the uninvited (but not necessarily unwelcome,) intrusions of their neighbors and those who are in the know of Al-Haitham’s experiment. </p><p>(This makes it seem as though it is a great secret, but it is not. Al-Haitham does not particularly care who knows about this endeavor but he isn’t going to go around actively informing people of it. There are other things he would rather talk about than this.)</p><p>Choice in conversational topics aside, Al-Haitham finds himself swept up into their neighbor’s houses, standing in their yards and listening as they talk. Over repeated exposure to them in their different combinations of interactions, he has started to find his way towards his own place in these patterns of exchange. There is, as with most things, a certain series of patterns that these nearly-casual-but-strangely-intimate conversations follow. On one hand, topics ranging from scandals of thrice removed cousins are discussed openly and at length over cups of tea, and on the other hand discussions of someone switching spice vendors is held behind palm frond fans in hushed whispers. One would think that the perceived need for discretion would favor the former end of that spectrum of topics rather than the latter, but apparently that’s not so when it comes to neighbors speaking.</p><p>Al-Haitham learns this as he learns all of the other relationships between houses. It is not unlike learning the different rivalries between and within each darshan. It’s politics. Society enjoys a hierarchy, and groups of people congregate in flexible, permeable and transient, cliques based on similarities. Al-Haitham finds his place within this one, finding his balance and keel with minimal discomfort — this is mainly attributed to the fact that it is Nour Aunt who’s dragged him around to make the introductions and she seems to have quite a sway over half the street. It is not unsurprising. </p><p>Someday he is going to get her to come with him to the Akademiya. He already has a mental list of people he wants to unleash her upon. The list is flexible and ever changing and helps to keep him relaxed while working. He thinks that Lord Kusanli knows of this list and would whole-heartedly encourage him to follow through on it.</p><p>He and Sumeru’s Archon have a surprising amount of similarities when it comes to curiosity and sense of humor. Nahida, he knows, would probably help him in getting Nour in through the Akademiya doors and into a locked room with the first five people on this list. The first five people on this list are possibly the same five people Nahida would choose to put on a list like this.</p><p>For the most part, his neighbors speak to Al-Haitham of plants as he does not have much in the way of gossip that would matter to them unless one of them is hiding a very deep interest in the Akademiya's budgeting politics. Instead, as he begins to gain confidence in his current progress and his growing familiarity with his different neighbors, Al-Haitham starts to speak of some of the information he’s gleaned on his own through experience, research, and assessment with his Vision. Al-Haitham has not been actively using his Vision to push forward in this round of the experiment, but there are some passive things of being a dendro-Vision holder that he cannot turn off at will.</p><p>Sometimes, when Al-Haitham is standing under the sun, hands dusted in dirt and the echo of touch of leaf, of stem on his skin, he feels them in the back of his head. Like the river of his own thoughts, he feels against the shores of the mind the quiet touch of the lives around him. They do not feel in thoughts, in feelings that Al-Haitham can relate to or put to the language of tongues and warm-blooded bodies. But he <em>feels</em> them. Healthy and growing stronger, clearer, louder as they gain stability and a firm hold in the soil. It is like they are sprouting in his own mind, not just the world.</p><p>Perhaps if he were more poetic, romantic, like Kaveh or perhaps even Nahida, he would have softer words to describe it. But he is not either of them and so he can only say that it feels. That is all. It <em>feels</em>. Al-Haitham can feel it, them, and it just <em>is</em>. It’s a thing in the back of his mind the way sunlight is, the way a breeze is. It is a sensation that he was not overly aware or mindful of before. </p><p>Before this, Al-Haitham had peripherally known of this side-effect of having a dendro-Vision, but had not either the need nor interest to call upon it. Al-Haitham was much more interested in using his Vision for different sorts of experiments and adapting its powers to his existing skill-set. On the few occasions he has had used his Vision to be more in tune with the elements, it was always brief and targeted. He has never taken the time to truly explore with it. When not in use, he had let it that strange sense fall away from him; forgotten and out of mind. It has always been a shallow thing for him: brief and unremarkable.</p><p>Now that he has the interest (although not necessarily a need) he explores this previously underutilized facet of himself and his Vision. When he turns himself into it, it rises to meet him like when he lowers the power of his noise-canceling earphones. Al-Haitham slowly, incrementally, immerses himself into it for that moment of time to take it as it is. </p><p>Al-Haitham reaches out to pull that awareness forward and he can feel in a wordless, nebulous way, whether a plant is well or not. If this is something that can be finely tuned and honed towards deeper specifics over time is just another thing for him to add onto his growing list of questions that this experiment of his can address. </p><p>He has spoken to Nahida of this growing awareness and his explorations of it, but as expected she was unable to help in this specific field. The disparity in their power is just too great a gulf to relate across. It would be like a dragon trying to relate to a red-tailed lizard.</p><p>“I am much more intimately bound to the world than most others with the power of dendro,” Nahida had said through the body of a vole. The small tawny rodent was comfortably tucked between a pot of parsley that Al-Haitham was working on transferring into a slightly larger one so he could use the smaller pot to see if he could get the cut up eyes of a potato to root successfully. He had been assured that it was not very hard, but Al-Haitham’s has had slightly more difficultly with tubers and other root vegetables than propagations of the cutting and leaf variety. On a more positive and certain note, he is now proficient in growing from seed.</p><p>As Al-Haitham finished moving the parsley to its larger pot, pressing down on the soil around the base of the plant to make sure it was anchored properly, Nahida in the body of the vole, scurried up the now crowded row of wooden shelves. He’ll either have to build more soon or buy some. She lay down on the cool soil of Kaveh’s mint plant that had been transplanted not just once but twice since Al-Haitham took over its care. </p><p>“How do you feel about feeling?” Nahida asked.</p><p>Instead of answering her, Al-Haitham asked a much more (in his opinion) interesting question, “Is there a particular reason why you choose the hosts that you do? Are you unable to borrow the bodies of larger creatures? Or is it simply expedience? Do I have to worry about an infestation?”</p><p>“I don’t want to get in the way, are you deflecting?”</p><p>“No. I don’t know what I feel about feeling. It simply is. What am I supposed to think of it?” Al-Haitham clapped his hands together, sprinkling dirt off of his hands before he started to brush more dirt off of the lower leaves of parsley. “So you could, if you wanted, borrow something further up in the evolutionary chain?”</p><p>“I could. The more complex the brain the harder it is though,” Nahida admitted. “I’ve not tried to, aside from humans. And as you can imagine, I’m rather reluctant to utilize on that particular skill. Things are different now. I don’t need to. Besides, don’t you like this form?”</p><p>“It’s <em>a</em> form,” Al-Haitham replied. And then he held his hand out to the mouse that scrambled into his palm and up his arm to lay over his shoulder, little claws curled up into the fabric of the loose shirt he’d mentally assigned as his one of his “garden work” shirts. “You realize that you don’t need to use this form, either.”</p><p>“How do you mean? Did you like the bird?”</p><p>“I’m neutral on the bird and the mouse and all of the other creatures you’ve borrowed to come to me as. I meant that you could walk in here on your own two feet if you wanted,” Al-Haitham said.</p><p>The vole on his shoulder released its claws and suddenly tipped over, falling down his chest. Al-Haitham caught his god in the palm of his hands, alarmed. But Nahida’s eyes stared out at him through the face of the mouse, the rodent’s nose and whiskers twitching, limbs curled up close to the body, the picture of shocked.</p><p>“I could?” Nahida said. “My own…? Oh. <em>Oh</em>! You’re right! Al-Haitham, you’re <em>right</em>!”</p><p>“Yes,” he said. “I know. Is something happening where you are? Do you need to focus on that instead?”</p><p>“Something is <em>always</em> happening where I am,” Nahida recovered herself, wriggling over to curl the mouse’s fore-paws around a finger in an approximation of a hug, patting him approvingly. “You’re clever, Al-Haitham. I can’t believe I didn’t realize it sooner. It should be so obvious. I’ve been walking all over Sumeru already! I wonder why it didn't come together for me until just now? This is something I will be thinking of on my own time. Back to you. Now show me the pot with the seeds I gave you.”</p><p>Al-Haitham has not been able to identify what it is that she’s having him grow. Nahida <em>claims</em> that she doesn’t know either, it’s meant to be a surprise. Whatever it is, Al-Haitham’s been doing fairly well thus far. It sprouted. And it’s growing fast. At the very least, he knows what it is not, and that’s about all that he can say with any measure of certainty on the topic.</p><p>It appears to be growing well. There were a few occasions where he was concerned that he would have to start over again, but the plant had managed to rally and overcome whatever issue it had been facing. It is one long, still growing, stem that has bent over under its own weight forming a small arc. It seems undeterred by this, continuing to grow downwards, then back up, and then down again as its weight causes it to bend in its attempts to blindly seek out space. The stem, at its base, has started to become woody, almost red-brown with exposure, and thorny. Al-Haitham, upon noticing the color change, could not tell if the plant was dehydrated or burning. But it has continued to grow — green paving the way for red-brown, so he takes it that this must be a natural part of the plant’s life cycle.</p><p>He will have to build something for it to crawl along though, as it has recently started to tangle itself up with other plants and pots in its efforts to claim more space for its own. </p><p>The other plants, more fast growing and easier to settle into stages of production, are also doing quite well with the occasional mishap. The neighbors who invite themselves over comment on which vegetables look like they will be good, and begin offering advice on how to protect them from pests and what to look out and keep in mind in terms of growth and development.</p><p>Al-Haitham has noticed an increase in insects and other wildlife now that the garden is more green than brown dust and grey stone. It is a logical progression that renders him awed and strangely mystified all the same. Duskbirds and finches regularly come to trill and rest in the small space. Butterflies and bees come to inspect the small flowers waiting to be pollinated. Once or twice he has seen what he thinks is a hummingbird — a more familiar sight around Nour’s house — zoom in and then out again. Lizards can be spotted clinging to the side of large pots or wriggling into the shade underneath the thicker, bushier plants like the basil and mint.</p><p>He has also noticed a distinct change in the way that he has apportioned his time. It is not just the time spent actively maintaining the garden — the watering, the pruning, the cleaning, the checking of soil and leaves and inspection of budding flower and the beginnings of vegetable growth. Al-Haitham has found himself spending a significant amount of time either in the courtyard or looking out into it for no other reason than to just look. Time he would otherwise use on reading, on resting, on exercise, on other types of leisure, has been given over towards the courtyard with a slowly growing frequency.</p><p>Al-Haitham has never considered himself a prideful person. Others have called him arrogant and a know-it-all, but he sees no point in false modesty. He is not, he thinks, sentimental either. He is prone to it when the occasion and the mood strike, but he is not like Kaveh who’s eye and heart linger over shadows and ghosts that conjure themselves to haunt despite being at peace. </p><p>When a project is finished it is finished. He takes a moment to review, feel pleased with the work done, and then he puts it behind himself to move onto the next thing. </p><p>It is true that this current experiment is somewhat ongoing. He is tentatively willing to label the current state of the garden a success, but until the plant Nahida gave him is fully grown and identified he will hold off on that conclusion. Al-Haitham, through his discussions with Nahida about the progress of the garden, has more or less come to understand the answers to most of his questions, or come close to understanding the shape of what they might be.</p><p>In any case, it is not like him to linger like so. There’s no point to it. The plants do not benefit from him staring at them, unless that’s some secret to gardening no one has told him or cared to write down in any book on the topic. This returns him to his questions, the subjects and answers he has been trying to understand through this experiment.</p><p>Al-Haitham pushes the window of his study open a little further, watching as a pair of lizards scuttle after each other in stop-and-go bursts of motion. The two lizard travel in a loop around and through the carefully arranged pots of herbs, one trailing after the other. He watches them long enough that when he turns away to continue writing his notes on his progress with the different plants his ink has gone dry.</p><p>While there is no real purpose to him looking out the windows or lingering in the doorway, he has to admit that it <em>feels</em> good, which should be purpose all on its own. It feels satisfying. It’s soothing — as soothing as the feeling of the soil in his hands, of the now familiar motions of sifting dirt and pressing his fingertips to root and stem and soil and leaf.</p><p><em>That</em> is one question answered with certainty. The work of gardening and planting <em>does</em> settle that strange restlessness that sometimes manages to escape past his control and evade all other attempts at being soothed. He has not had an episode as strong as the one that caused him to begin this entire experiment, but the few times he had been able to recognize the sensitivity and the excess energy starting to creep upon him he has turned to the soil, the leaf and the root, and was able to submerge himself in the feeling to come out the other end settled and calm with minimal struggle. He has not noticed a decline in the efficacy of this method of addressing his body’s strange moods and he can only hope that it means there won’t be one. Time and further testing will tell — he supposes it’s also a matter of the degree of severity of episode his body is experiencing. But for now he’s content with knowing that this does work as a method to calm and pacify his stranger moods.</p><p>That the answer has somewhat expanded beyond the original scope of the question is something of a surprise. There is a simple comfort to be found in just looking at the growing and flourishing garden as it takes over the plain walls and stone of the courtyard. Even without the feeling of restlessness or other discomfort — as proven by the shift of his time and attentions. </p><p>All of those Amurta studies on the benefits of vegetation on mood and overall mental health are proving themselves several times over.</p><p>Meanwhile, in complete contrast to Al-Haitham finding a new level of contentment at home to explore and make familiar, Kaveh is almost never here anymore. Most of the household chores have fallen to Al-Haitham as a result. And part of these chores, apparently, is more consistent interaction with the neighbors who have now turned, purposefully, towards seeking him out for news on Kaveh, as though Al-Haitham would know.</p><p>Kaveh’s already packed schedule, in the past few weeks, has somehow gained a new onslaught of things vying for his already strained attentions. Kaveh’s new sources of fame have stretched him out so incredibly thin that Al-Haitham can’t even keep track of where the man is at any given moment any longer. It’s really anyone’s guess. On the few occasions that Kaveh is here, he’s locked up in his room toiling away at any number of things that may or may not result in actual mora compensation. Al-Haitham has taken a glance into Kaveh’s room now and again, and every time he’s looked he’d been more and more disturbed by the sheer amount of things accumulated within.</p><p>Kaveh’s always kept his room relatively neat — organized chaos as it were. Kaveh has always worked multiple projects at once, cycling through them each one at a time to keep himself fresh. But between his employ as a lecturer at the Akademiya, his increased role in consultations, private commissions, and whatever else he’s up to, Kaveh’s projects have ballooned out to consume every spare surface of the once semi-tidy room. He's not sure where or how Kaveh is sleeping.</p><p>Al-Haitham sees an entire box of machine parts that may or may not be for Mehrak being used to keep several pieces of plywood and veneer samples upright against a wall. He sees a stack of documents that would go up to Kaveh’s hip next to a stack of books with titles from Fontaine, Sumeru, Liyue, and even Inazuma. Kaveh’s at least been folding his laundry, but hasn’t had the time to put it away, instead keeping the folded garments in piles wherever he can find the space.</p><p>Kaveh’s mail in the front room arrives in stacks thicker than Al-Haitham’s hand, ranging from whole portfolios to thin little calling cards. Most are from within Sumeru, but there are some from Fontaine and a few from Liyue. Al-Haitham cannot imagine Kaveh responding to all of these in a timely manner, but he must be somehow.</p><p>Al-Haitham can respect the work ethic to a degree. Kaveh’s commitment to upholding his oaths and duties is admirable, but as always Kaveh takes everything to an extreme. It is not, however, Al-Haitham’s place to tell Kaveh of this. When they last had time to speak, when Kaveh last seriously spoke to him, he had mentioned his understanding for a need to change. But Al-Haitham did not think Kaveh’s type of change would cause him to lean even heavier onto the stressors that he had brought into his life. Kaveh was already on the road towards burnout before this, now he’s practically sprinting through it like there’s a deadline he has to meet.</p><p>At the very least, not all of Kaveh’s schedule is work oriented. Kaveh is somehow squeezing in time for more personal appointments. Perhaps it is guilt that causes him to squeeze in time with their mutual acquaintances, but if it gets Kaveh out of the house for something that isn’t a consult, a class, or some sort of philanthropic project, (no matter how briefly or how intermittently it does so) Al-Haitham isn’t going to complain. Kaveh’s guilt towards his use of time is something the man has to work out on his own, along with everything else. Besides, if he’s meeting up with friends then Al-Haitham can at least know that Kaveh is in good hands. Perhaps one of <em>them</em> can talk sense into him, or figure out what it is that Kaveh is up to acting as he is.</p><p>Today, Kaveh is out for a late lunch with Tighnari and Senior Faruzan. With any luck, Senior Faruzan will keep Kaveh still long enough for the man to catch a breath. Meanwhile, Al-Haitham is enjoying himself as he finishes up writing his notes on the garden’s current progress. Nahida had said he did not need to write an actual report, so he isn’t. But he’s always found keeping a track record for his projects helpful for sorting his thoughts and understanding his findings. It would be especially beneficial in this specific one as a great part of the experiment relies on his own personal mood and frame of view. Also — he’s had so many conflicting anecdotes and pieces of advice given to him that it’s getting cumbersome to keep track of what he has and hasn’t tried, who told him what, and the like clear in his mind.</p><p>He has a few more books on gardening and cultivating lined up towards the edge of his desk to browse. Nahida had them sent to him and he’s curious what she thinks he will gain from them. These books are less about technique and more in-line with personal anecdotes like the ones Al-Haitham is currently writing down. It is, all and all, a pleasant and productive afternoon that’s about to stretch out before him.</p><p>Which means that it <em>must</em> be disrupted by a brisk series of knocks upon the front door.</p><p>Al-Haitham sighs, standing to meet whoever it is.</p><p>It turns out to be the niece of one of the neighbors, who looks extremely frazzled and impatient as she informs him that he is, apparently, late. <em>For what,</em> he asks, and is promptly ignored in the way only teenagers are capable of pulling off as she turns around and dashes off back from where she came. He sees her pause to vault over the wooden fence of another house and start pounding on their door. At least he isn’t the only one who is (supposedly) late.</p><p>He could go back to his writing, his reading, but he has a strong feeling that if he does not show up for whatever this is, the next summons will be a lot louder and disruptive in nature. Ignoring that Al-Haitham does not know <em>what</em> he’s late for or <em>where</em> he’s supposed to be, Al-Haitham leaves the house and walks towards the residential end of the street. As he approaches he sees and hears the sound of a large group of people. Potentially the entire street’s worth of people, he notes, as he sees people coming and going from their houses and flowing like water into the back yard of a specific house. </p><p>A gaggle of children with a ball, chased and chasing about six dogs, rushes past him out of the yard of that house. The children are followed by four sullen looking teenagers who pay him absolutely no mind as he watches them all go before making his way into the heart of the commotion that can’t quite be fully contained by the house. Every window and door of the house appears to be open. Judging by the amount of people here, he would be surprised if glass and wood would be capable of containing such an atmosphere.</p><p>As soon as Al-Haitham rounds the corner into the back yard, he’s immediately snatched up by several older women and ushered out of the yard into the kitchen. Nour Aunt is there with her cleaver, mincing meat and arguing with several other older women who are also in the middle of cooking. Oil hisses, steam rises in half-clear clouds, and Al-Haitham suppresses a violent sneeze from all of the strong smells. His head is already spinning.</p><p>This is, he thinks, the culmination of allowing the neighbors pull him aside to chatter at him over the past several weeks without protest.</p><p>“<em>You</em>,” Nour Aunt points the cleaver at him, “Where have you been?”</p><p>“Would you ever consider a career in law enforcement?” Al-Haitham replies, raising his noise cancelling up just enough to drown out the hiss of oil and the crackle of the cook fire and the rhythmic thumping of cleavers and knives against cutting boards.</p><p>“Sister Nour says you’re competent in a kitchen,” another woman shoves a basket of shrimps at him. “Peel and de-vein, tails on. Do well and I’ll consider upgrading you to actual work.”</p><p>“Am I being abducted?” Al-Haitham asks as he finds a space to start working next to a young man who’s grating carrot like something important depends on it. Perhaps there is. In a situation like this it’s best to just go with the flow so Al-Haitham decides not to resist overly much.</p><p>Nour Aunt squints at him. She is somehow cutting meat without even looking at her hands with absolute confidence.</p><p>“Your Kaveh was told to tell you to be here four hours ago for preparation,” she informs him. “Now, I know young men like you are terrible with keeping time. So I purposefully told him to have you here two hours earlier than absolutely necessary. And <em>still</em> you are late and we had to send for you. Do you know how difficult it is to get a teenager to do something? Slightly more difficult than getting an adult man to do something that he didn’t think of on his own.”</p><p>“And when was Kaveh told to tell me this?” </p><p>“Two days ago.”</p><p>“Nour Aunt, Kaveh and I have not spoken to each other in a week.” Well. Kaveh’s yelled at Al-Haitham to see if Al-Haitham has seen certain books or items that he misplaced, and he’s yelled at Al-Haitham to <em>please, please, please just make me some extra coffee, I’m at a good place right now and I can’t stop.</em> But Al-Haitham does not think that counts as actually talking, seeing as how Al-Haitham did not verbally respond to any of those forms of address.</p><p>(Kaveh’s also been mumbling to himself and Al-Haitham has sometimes overheard him in the middle of his muttering. Al-Haitham has also, out of curiosity, replied to some of Kaveh’s ramblings to see if Kaveh would notice or react, and was deeply intrigued to find out that the answer is <em>sometimes</em>, but not in ways that would be anticipated.</p><p>For example once when Kaveh, staring blankly at a wall while waiting for the tea kettle to come to a boil, he said out loud, “I’m going to walk into the ocean.”</p><p>Al-Haitham, not quite fully awake himself and still processing the disappointment of waking up and not having it be miraculously a weekend, asked, “Which one?”</p><p>Kaveh blinked. One long, slow blink, like a particularly sun-addled cat. Still staring blankly at the wall he then said, “The ocean is soup.” And then promptly put his head down on the countertop and started to mutter about scheduling issues. Al-Haitham didn’t bother with <em>that</em> any further.)</p><p>“What, are you two fighting again?”</p><p>“He’s working, Nour Aunt.”</p><p>Nour frowns, the cleaver thumping into the thick wooden board and remaining upright as she moves all of the minced meat into a bowl.</p><p>“Well he’s here now, Sister Nour, peace, peace,” a woman in the middle of mincing a mountain of garlic says, not looking away from her cutting board. “You were telling us of the nephew. What’s Hadeer done now? Or not done? How come you aren’t talking about your niece? When’s she due, I miss her coming to these little gatherings.”</p><p>Nour needs no further invitation and launches into an exhaustive review of Hadeer’s failures as a nephew, son, and filial member of the family but success as an irritant to his mother, Nour’s sister-in-law. Al-Haitham is allowed to fade into the background for this as he starts to gather information on what’s going on based on.</p><p>According to the snippets of conversation and the fragments of old conversations being rehashed that Al-Haitham pieces together, this sort of gathering is not an uncommon one. Every few months someone volunteers their house for a day and everyone comes together to cook and eat and catch up and discuss matters of the street from packs of stray dogs to any suspicious persons spotted lingering. The latter is less about security concerns and more of a barely veiled way of talking about various courtships going on and whether or not these prospective partners are approved of.</p><p>Kaveh, apparently, would occasionally frequent these gatherings when he had the time, but if there’s one thing Kaveh no longer has it’s time. Al-Haitham’s never been invited (clearly) because no one knew how to get a hold of him and Kaveh insisted Al-Haitham wouldn’t really contribute much of anything to these things anyway. Al-Haitham needs to remember to do something nice for Kaveh to thank him for sparing him this for however long Kaveh’s been part of it. Maybe Al-Haitham will clear out some more shelf-space in the front room for Kaveh after all.</p><p>Unfortunately, now that Al-Haitham’s been dragged over to several of their houses and been successfully engaged in conversation, they have all decided that he is free game for them to haul over <em>here</em> as they please. He is officially invited, and with Nour testifying to his average ability in a kitchen, he’s been assigned to assisting with the cooking. Al-Haitham thinks that this is Nour’s own particular brand of kindness: sparing him from having to socialize. Kaveh wasn’t wrong, Al-Haitham has nothing to contribute here except being another body.</p><p>Al-Haitham is tempted to just leave. His distaste for crowds, loud noise, and over abundance of other sensory stimulus is one thing about him that has not been exaggerated by rumors. There’s no reason why he couldn’t leave other than it being rude. However one could argue that it was <em>equally</em> as rude for his presence to be demanded and for him to be put to work like so without a question as to his willingness to participate.</p><p>But a lot of these people have been openly helpful to him in his gardening project without asking for much in return. Sitting in a crowded kitchen while preparing ingredients and being talked around is not a very high price to pay. It’s a lot like what happens when he goes out with Dehya and Cyno, actually. They all just seem satisfied that he’s present.</p><p>So Al-Haitham slides his headphones up to their maximum noise cancelling capacity and lets himself sink into the manual labor taking care of whatever ingredient is put in front of him. No one bothers him except to take away bowls of ingredients and scrap-trash, or to hand him new things to prepare. It’s somewhat like meal-prepping at home, except on a larger scale. </p><p>Slowly he feels himself relax. It truly is like going out with the others, or sitting in the back of the House of Daena with Layla, or quietly writing away in a corner of Lord Kusanali’s office as meetings go on around him. </p><p>He lets the smells and the warmth of the house wash over him. Every time he tunes into conversation he has no idea what it’s about and he spends a few minutes doing mental gymnastics to see if he can figure out how they arrived at the topic and if he can glean anything interesting from it. It’s like he’s being dropped into a brand new book in medias res every time and it’s admittedly quite intriguing. Kaveh is right, <em>all scholars are gossips.</em></p><p>He does not know how long he is there for, but at some point he’s handed several platters of food, a woven cloth bag filled with fruits and vegetables, a basket of fresh eggs, and a vessel of home-made wine, and is sent off on his way, his purpose apparently served.</p><p>Between one moment and the next Al-Haitham is standing in his own kitchen weighted down by a truly inordinate amount of food and feeling strangely confused but relieved by the sudden absence of noise and bodies. </p><p>Later, when Kaveh returns, Kaveh is startled out of his seemingly perpetually dazed-overworked state by the rows upon rows of dishes that are crowding the kitchen table and counters.</p><p>“Was that today?” Kaveh asks, double taking on his way through to his room and almost running into the wall in the process. He is saved only by Mehrak’s timely and exasperated intervention. Al-Haitham, in the middle of reheating briyani and an entire roast chicken doesn’t bother to answer him. The man has working eyes and the capacity to draw connections. Kaveh sighs. “I did warn you. Do you need me to warn <em>them</em> off?”</p><p>It <em>was</em> inconvenient to be pulled out of his plans for the day, especially when he had already inadvertently interrupted himself with his idle gazing. But the result is an overabundance of different types of food both he and Kaveh are too lazy or not skilled enough to attempt, as well as an afternoon of irrelevant but nonetheless amusing information gathering. All knowledge in the right hands, in the right situation, can eventually prove itself useful. Eventually. He doesn’t think he would ever volunteer his house to host such an event, nor would he ever want to join the actual festivities that were cropping up in other areas out of the house. But if dragged into such an event again and given some more manual tasks, he doesn’t think he would particularly mind. Supposedly these large gatherings only happen every few months. Al-Haitham can sacrifice one afternoon every few months.</p><p>Al-Haitham points at a chair. “I can handle myself. Pick a dish and finish it.”</p><p>-</p><p>The rest of the occupants of the street that has adopted Al-Haitham and Kaveh’s house as part of their own do not, exactly, begin to infringe upon him as Nour and Sarath and some of the neighbors he had been regularly talking to have been doing. Although, for Al-Haitham, this involvement is most likely much more subdued than it would be for Kaveh or anyone else. Perhaps it is due to any lingering reservations, or unfamiliarity, but for the most part, acknowledgement of the growing awareness of Al-Haitham remains contained towards brief conversations and a lot of gardening advice.</p><p>Al-Haitham has a theory that he is not being flagged down because any of them want to engage with him in conversation — his ability to small talk is greatly eclipsed by his lack of interest in doing so —and are more interested in finding out how much they can pass onto him in terms of produce.</p><p>In Al-Haitham’s faded and distant memories of childhood, he remembers his grandmother sometimes coming back with corn or lemons or pitayas, not bought, but given. At the boundary wall of her house, a neighbor’s peach tree grew gnarled and crooked, leaning over the line with drooping boughs and he was told to pick from it freely. </p><p>Sometimes his grandmother would have him help her open crates carefully filled with sacks of rice, bitter gourd, eggplant, plums, cherries, or figs. Al-Haitham has lived his entire life in this city, but he knows that he has distant relatives who tend the land, an ancestral plot, and they would send a portion of their harvest to his grandmother. When she passed, his knowledge of how this particular exchange worked left with her, and he never saw these deliveries again.</p><p>The exchange of produce between houses is some facet of society that he’d peripherally understood as something that happens, but forgotten until it was applicable to himself. There is something about having plants that are capable of producing something edible that causes people to attempt to foist off their harvest onto as many other people as possible without having to get something back. It is its own dialogue, its own peculiar sort of interaction — one Al-Haitham is belatedly learning to understand.</p><p>Growing things makes a person strange, he decides, trapped in a back and forth over refusing four watermelons. One watermelon he would say yes to. There is no way that he and Kaveh (if Kaveh deigned to show his face for longer than five minutes at a time) could eat <em>four</em> whole watermelons. Meanwhile, both he and the man attempting to foist watermelons onto him, are trying to avoid eye contact or any form of acknowledgement of the pair of neighbors arguing at the gate one house over. A woman is shaking a brace of rabbits while also trying to fend off tomatoes and cucumbers that is attempting to be passed over the fence towards her. Thus far it has been a lot like bartering at the market, except instead of trying to pay less, they are all trying to get rid of things they do not need while trying to walk away with the least amount of new things as feasibly possible. No one here wants an exchange. They want to drop whatever is in their hands and leave.</p><p>The only upside to all of this is that the grocery bill is hitting an eye-brow raising low. He has redirected these funds towards new books, and at Nahida’s suggestion, some garden ornaments.</p><p>“<em>Yaar</em>, come on. Don’t you have plenty of friends to split a melon with?” The man insists. The only reason Al-Haitham doesn’t drop the melons to crack right there is because if they make a scene (a bigger scene than this one at least) there is a high chance that the owner of this house will come out with their own armful of goods that he’ll have to avoid.</p><p>“No,” Al-Haitham says. And then he remembers that half of the people he knows work in the Akademiya and that means they’re always starving or on a budget and usually both at the same time. “Yes.”</p><p>“<em>Bhaisaheb -- which is it?</em>”</p><p>Al-Haitham grudgingly takes all four watermelons and mentally vows that the second he has anything in terms of an actual harvest from his garden he’s going to track this man down and use what all of Al-Haitham’s various acquaintances call his “tenacious dedication to being a brat”.</p><p>(The use word brat is Kaveh’s more than it is anyone else’s, but whenever Al-Haitham has heard Kaveh use it, no one else has jumped up to correct him so he knows they agree.)</p><p>The next time he sees her, Al-Haitham gives Layla a watermelon and does not explain himself. She visibly considers the effort it would take to get him to give her some form of answer for an entire five minutes of silence as she gazes off into the middle-distance. Al-Haitham (very generously) doesn’t walk away while she’s doing this, and instead starts to mark up her current paper. Layla wisely decides to take the practical path of least resistance and thanks him for the watermelon.</p><p>Cyno takes less time to decide on acceptance. He stares down at the melon in his hands for all of a second before tucking the melon under one arm without so much as blinking. Instead, he continues to argue with Al-Haitham over updates to the Matra-Mahamata joint works form. Al-Haitham does not know why <em>they</em> are arguing about this. Al-Haitham reviews and files these forms but he doesn’t get control over what’s actually <em>on</em> the forms. That’s the Administrator’s job and Al-Haitham would rather do overtime on a weekend than talk to the Administrator voluntarily. Cyno should know this. Al-Haitham has definitely mentioned his irritation with his Mahamata counterparts at least once in passing. The once should be enough.</p><p>Al-Haitham manages to catch Senior Faruzan to give her a watermelon as well. Frankly, he was just running out of people to give watermelon to and he has a half-muted memory of someone talking about how much Senior Faruzan can eat in one sitting, like she’s constantly starving. Considering her history, he wouldn’t be surprised if that was so. </p><p>“<em>Finally</em>, someone who knows how things work.” Senior Faruzan nods approvingly, knocking her knuckles against the watermelon, eyes squinted as she holds the giant fruit up to her ear. “That Kaveh sure does like to complain about you being rude but he’s never brought <em>me</em> a watermelon before. Did you grow this?”</p><p>“No.” Al-Haitham does not have the space to be growing watermelon in the courtyard. It’s already busy enough with vegetables and herbs, and whatever it is that Nahida is having him grow. It’s still growing and its thorns are wicked sharp, but it’s begun to put out thick bundles of leaves all up and down its main stalk. He’s not sure if he’s meant to be pruning or not and it’s not exactly something he can figure out with trial and error. He only has the one stalk.</p><p>The final watermelon is too much for him alone. When Kaveh is present in the house and not furiously working through mysterious stacks of work, he’s passed out on whatever semi-flat surface is closest. It seems every other house has fallen victim to the watermelon distribution so he can’t risk trying to foist it off onto someone else — he might come back with a tree and more watermelon. Al-Haitham will admit to having had to use his Vision to teleport past Nour Aunt’s house thrice now because he has seen her at her window squinting out for victims to foist food onto. Even the children have taken to ducking low to the ground so they can pass hidden by the wooden fence posts.</p><p>In a quiet moment after the twice a month meeting between Lord Kusanali and the upper management of the Mahamata ranks, Nahida asks Al-Haitham about his experiment findings thus far. Al-Haitham, in the middle of straightening his notes and mentally reviewing all the ways he can get his new assignments done as fast as possible without actually interacting with any of the rest of his Mahamata cohort, tells her about the incoming flux of produce he’s seen and the strange ongoing war of harvest the entire street has fallen to. Nahida listens with rapt attention, laughter, awe, and polite confusion in her face as she nods along with his brief explanation of the situation he’s found himself unwillingly roped into.</p><p>“Are you excited for your vegetables to get ripe because you would count it as a personal success, or because you want to take part in this…war? There certainly has to be a better word for it than <em>war</em>, Al-Haitham.”</p><p>Nahida has not been the one fending off literal vegetables being thrown over the fence with terrifying accuracy straight into his open window or door. Al-Haitham has to wonder how the Corps of Thirty and Matra have personnel shortages when the uncle from down the street can get an entire eggplant thrown through Al-Haitham’s barely cracked open door in a single shot. That Al-Haitham can remember the man is a r<em>etired accountant.</em></p><p>They say experience is the best teacher, but Al-Haitham cannot in good conscience unleash this warfare onto the Archon of the land. At the same time, it would also be deeply unfair of him to deny her the chance to understand something firsthand.</p><p>“Observe and draw your own conclusions,” he says, mind turning to the last of the watermelons. Nahida is small but she’s a god so maybe she can finish off a quarter of it.</p><p>“Are you inviting me to your house?”</p><p>“You were already invited to my house and you did not need that invitation to come before,” Al-Haitham points out. “Are you allergic to watermelon?”</p><p>“I’ve not had watermelon before with this body,” she answered after a long moment where she tapped a finger against the side of her face, eyes squinted off as she sorted through memories. </p><p>This is how it comes to be that Nahida is sitting in the shade of the doorway from kitchen to courtyard, crunching down on watermelon and offering commentary as Al-Haitham builds structures of simple wood and wire for the plants and crawling vines, her own mystery plant being among them. He carefully winds stubborn and fragile stems and stalks through and around wood, binding them with wire and twine. He arranges pots and newly constructed wooden shelves to maintain the strange jig-saw configuration that keeps each plant in its optimal growing zone. </p><p>Every time Nahida’s senses pick up a transaction about to occur between neighbors, she disappears back inside the house to find a good place from the front room window to observe. Al-Haitham had warned her not to get caught. Her identity as the nation’s Archon would not protect her from being swindled into literal armloads full of produce that she couldn’t do anything with and he wasn’t going to be helping her because then they would be <em>two</em> households to target instead of just the one.</p><p>“I am a god,” Nahida had said with full confidence, “I think I can avoid being spotted if I should please it, Al-Haitham. You worry about how you’re going to get your mystery plant to behave with that trellis, and how you’re going to fix the lean of that tomato plant. I think you should really consider the upside down gardening method to save space. Studies have shown tomatoes grow quite well when hung upside down.”</p><p>To her credit, she <em>did</em> manage to successfully avoid being noticed in her observations at least twice before she got caught. Al-Haitham noted her prolonged absence as he was untangling the leaves and stems of the mint and basil and parsley which had somehow all gotten tangled together despite them being an entire shelf’s width apart from each other. He ended up having to take shears to the mint and basil (again) and shoving the parsley over to a far corner of the wooden shelf. He’s not going through this again. The combined smells of all three herbs keeps making him sneeze.</p><p>Nahida returns with a peach in her mouth, and a basket the same size she is filled with various produce hovering behind her.</p><p>“You shouldn’t have let them know you have telekinesis,” Al-Haitham says when he sees her. “Now you cannot use the excuse of not having hands to carry something.”</p><p>“Upon further observation I have concluded that your descriptor of these exchanges as an ongoing war to be appropriate in degree,” Nahida says after she finishes her bite of peach. “Also are we all quite sure that your neighbor is near blind? Is there a possibility that she’s faking it to get everyone to let down their guard?”</p><p>“You sound like the General Mahamatra.” Nahida smiles, broad and happy. Al-Haitham sighs, “That wasn’t meant to be a compliment.”</p><p>“Ah, but that’s rather up to me, isn’t it?” Nahida says, rummaging around in the giant basket. It’s rather comical but Al-Haitham isn’t laughing when she extracts a bitter gourd the size of her entire torso in one hand and one the size of Al-Haitham’s palm in the other. “Do you know how to cook these?”</p><p>“You should be asking me if I <em>want</em> to cook it.” Al-Haitham shoots an annoyed glance at his own bitter melon gourd, which has been recalcitrant to grow in any direction despite the fact that he can find nothing wrong with it. The vine looks healthy enough, it just wont grow further for whatever reason. He’s even attempted assessing it with his Vision, but found nothing wrong there either.</p><p>He ends up stir frying it for her as they talk over the exchanges she had observed as he was tending the courtyard. Nahida does not seem fond of the taste but she decides that it’s been a good experience overall and she’s hopeful that his own plant decides to move things along soon.</p><p>That night Kaveh comes home and is energetic enough to eat dinner at the table.</p><p>“I thought your bitter gourd wasn’t growing,” Kaveh says, grimacing at the sharp taste of the vegetable.</p><p>On the few instances when Kaveh has had a moment to speak of anything other than work or minor tasks he asks Al-Haitham for assistance with, Kaveh has made sure to continue to ask about Al-Haitham’s experiment, his garden. Kaveh has not had the opportunity to see it as it is now, not with his current schedule. The few times Kaveh has had a moment and the will to look at it have been at night. </p><p><em>And I am sure,</em> Kaveh had once remarked as he hurriedly pulled his hair back from his face, jabbing a pencil in to keep it in place,<em> that by daylight it is much more impressive.</em></p><p>Kaveh’s schedule has barely begun to ease up from the rigorous pacing Kaveh has inexplicably set. <em>Barely</em>. But Al-Haitham <em>has</em> noticed an easing in the frantic pace. Moments when Kaveh can stop to breathe have increased. More of his outings are tied towards more personal projects; his free tutoring classes in Port Ormos instead of his paid position in the Akademiya, nights out at the theater, sprawled out afternoons in clubs discussing this or that new topic of theory and philosophy, trips to Pardis Dhyai and Gandharva Ville, leisurely walks through Sumeru City’s several markets. </p><p>At a glance at the slate used to share details of their schedules, Al-Haitham has seen a decrease in notes concerning future projects, future plans. Al-Haitham does not know what caused Kaveh to abruptly push himself so hard, but some form of end is in sight apparently.</p><p>But a greater freedom with his time does not fix everything. Kaveh is better and getting better as more things fall into completion and off of his schedule, but the things that do remain — or perhaps things Al-Haitham just doesn’t know about — continue to trouble him. Kaveh remains prone to his usual moods of anxiousness where he burrows himself away into whatever is in front of him in order to avoid what is catching up to him, or he somehow manages to disappear without anyone knowing where he is for several hours before returning as though nothing at all had happened.</p><p>That Kaveh has the time to do the latter, now, is something Al-Haitham chooses to believe is a positive.</p><p>Kaveh, after a meeting with a client to discuss further necessary adjustments to the commission and necessary forms that need to be submitted to the Akademiya for approval to break ground and proceed, promptly evaporated into thin air for the rest of the day. Al-Haitham knows this because Senior Faruzan set herself up in a corner of his office and talked at him about it for a whole hour and a half (supposedly she’d been trying to look for Kaveh in order to treat him to a nice meal because she’d managed to have quite a fulfilling discussion about a joint Kshahrewar-Haravatat project, she didn’t want to recruit him for it but she used some of his advice and wanted to thank him for the help) while picking his brain for thoughts regarding low Haravatat enrollment numbers.</p><p>Al-Haitham has very little opinions on either topic but Senior Faruzan’s presence is an excellent deterrent to keep other interlopers out of his office. It’s been months since he stepped down as Acting Grand Sage and there are still stragglers who are desperate enough to try his door and his ear to get their way when they are denied through official channels. He doesn’t know why people think he’d be a sympathetic ear or hand in these situations.</p><p>Kaveh is not at the house when Al-Haitham returns, nor does he show up when Al-Haitham is tending to the courtyard — an activity hat has grown to take up almost a full hours of his time after work, not including the brief check he’s taken to doing every morning upon waking. Al-Haitham has grudgingly moved his waking time earlier to accommodate for this. But, as always, mild discomfort is an acceptable price to pay for the greater reward. In this case, losing the half hour of sleep is rewarded by having time to slowly run his fingers over new leaves, the meditative process of checking water levels in the soil, cutting off bits of the occasional bit of tattered or dying leaf, and breathing in the full, vibrant smell of so much green condensed into such a relatively small space. The river of thoughts that flows through the back of his mind is joined with the whisper of dendro, its own form of background noise that lulls his mind and guides him through his thoughts as he mentally sorts out his day. </p><p>It’s a time set aside to anchor himself. Unlike breakfast and his morning toilette, which is mainly used for him to process the grim and upsetting transition between peaceful sleep and having to be a working member of society, his time in his courtyard is soothing and tranquil in nature. He thinks of fragments of songs and poems; he turns over fragments of stories and studies he’s read for leisure. Al-Haitham thinks about the feeling of the sun on his face and the faint trill of bird song and the flutter of shadows. And then he stops thinking and just <em>feels</em>. He feels the sun. He feels leaves. He feels the delicate flesh of fruit, delicately clinging to their stems — not quite yet ready. Al-Haitham feels the faint not-quite-murmur of flora at the back of his head and feels it all settling deep into himself — a portable sense of calm.</p><p>Al-Haitham leaves to meet up with Dehya for dinner. She introduces him to Lady Dunyarzad, and Nilou and Cyno both make a surprise appearance. Al-Haitham welcomes the extra heads at the table gladly. Less talking for him to do if they’re here, not that anyone truly expects much from him in the way of talking. He follows along easily enough, and opportunity for one on one conversations come and go.</p><p>Nilou turns towards him at one point and asks him if he’s read any interesting stories that might be good material for her to base a dance on. Lately she has been trying to study sword forms from Liyue. In fact, she’s planning a trip to Liyue Harbor to watch some of their operas. She’s been put in touch with the director of Liyue’s most famous troupe and is excited to go. He offers her a few travel tips and they set up an appointment to meet so she can think of more detailed questions to ask him.</p><p>Lady Dunyarzad quietly, not-quite timidly, joins that conversation with Nilou as Nilou asks him about the border crossing and ideas for things to bring as gifts. Al-Haitham falls quiet as the two ladies speak of gifts and pleasantries and diplomacy, and then he’s brought back into it when Lady Dunyarzad asks him about the nature of his travels to Liyue and his experiences there. Al-Haitham admits that they were quite brief and sporadic — mostly done when he was an undergraduate and gaining his competency certification in oral translations. This sets him and Lady Dunyarzad on a light but altogether interesting discussion on dialects. Lady Dunyarzad is well read and studied, a side effect of a life spent almost entirely confined to bed rest.</p><p>Cyno asks Al-Haitham if he has more of the melon from last time — it was good, not too sweet, and he wanted to get some for Tighnari who is due to visit Sumeru City with Collei in a week or so.</p><p>Dehya asks him if he grew the watermelon, which is how Al-Haitham tells Cyno, Nilou, and Lady Dunyarzad of his current project. Cyno looks bemused as Nilou gently but firmly pulls out details of the gardening project from him one plant at a time. Al-Haitham still does not understand why there is such a high level interest by literally everyone he talks to about this and at this point he’s not going to question it any longer. He’s sure that he’s going to get some strange answer like “because it’s you” or something similar again. </p><p>By the time he returns home Kaveh has finally made himself known. </p><p>Kaveh is lying down in the front room, long limbs sprawled out, one leg and one arm hanging off of the edge of the divan, his other arm flung over his face, and the other leg half foot balanced on arm of the divan. He’s dictating to equations to Mehrak, waiting for the machine to finish each calculation and to hear the result before he adjusts the numbers one variable at a time.</p><p>Al-Haitham walks through he house quietly. He navigates the courtyard in the dark easily. He cuts mint and plucks a small, but ready, cucumber from the vine. In the kitchen he takes out a lemon that a neighbor passed onto him when he was fulfilling Nour Aunt’s command of bringing to that neighbor an entire pot of pudding because apparently the youngest daughter’s been hit with a mild fever but terribly upset stomach and wants nothing but pudding.</p><p>He washes both the mint and cucumber. He slices ginger and cucumber and lemon. He boils sugar and ginger together into syrup that he pours into the bottom of the glass. He adds in slices of cucumber and stalks of mint, pouring cool water over it all and mixing with a long spoon.</p><p>Kaveh is still dictating to Mehrak when Al-Haitham is done. Al-Haitham presses the cold glass to Kaveh’s cheek and watches as the man startles, limbs jerking out and flailing before falling back. He sits up though, taking the glass from Al-Haitham’s hand. He waves at Mehrak to take a break as he takes a slow sip of the infused water. And then Kaveh falls quiet. Al-Haitham watches the man out of the corner of his eye to see if he will do anything more. But Kaveh just sips at the water, leaning forward with his elbows on his knees, head bowed, exhaustion lining every part of him.</p><p><em>What did you change?</em> Al-Haitham wants to ask. He wants to prod, to poke, to test and examine. <em>Kaveh, you said that you recognized and understood a need for it. But what have you done? Is this satisfaction? Is this what you needed, what you wanted? If this is the price, what is the form of the reward?</em></p><p>If there is one thing that Al-Haitham has learned from his experiment with gardening, it is that there are some things happen on their own time. And there is no amount of calculation, of planning, of careful suggestion or benign manipulation that can get it to move any faster than it already is progressing. Attempting to rush it will only delay it, or worse, ruin it altogether.</p><p>So Al-Haitham closes his eyes, sinking into the river in the back of his mind — the one that is not his thoughts, but the feeling that comes from dendro. Through his Vision he reaches out, past his body, through the walls of wood and stone and tile, and draws the sensation of growth, of quiet, of satisfaction, over his mind like a blanket. He sinks into roots that are comfortably damp and cool. He splays out over broad and healthy leaves, smooth and shiny on the top, velvet and pale on the bottom. He winds himself through proud stems and stalks that may bend and twist but remain a sturdy backbone to connect leaf to root. </p><p>As he feels these things, he also feels himself. Food is warm in his stomach and he can still taste, in his breath, the spices and seasonings of the lamb he had eaten earlier. His hands are cool and damp, drying, from the preparation of the water and handling of the glass. His back is straight and his shoulders relaxed. The rug beneath his bare feet is well worn and soft. A cushion presses against his right hip, pressed between him and the arm of the divan. Kaveh’s knee barely brushes against his own. Al-Haitham feels the touch of their trousers every time Kaveh moves to drink.</p><p>And then, more firmly, more decisively, Al-Haitham feels a touch calling him back into himself. A hand, cool and damp with condensation, presses against his thigh, familiar fingers pressing into muscle.</p><p>Al-Haitham opens his eyes and turns towards Kaveh, his own hand moving to cover Kaveh’s on his own leg.</p><p>Kaveh’s other hand cradles his down-turned face, pressed against his eyes.</p><p>“I’m so tired,” Kaveh admits. “But I — Al-Haitham. Speak to me. Of anything. <em>Everything</em>. Talk to me of something that isn’t <em>me</em>, for a little while. I need to get outside of myself. I’m going to think myself into circles again and I’ve come so far already…”</p><p>Al-Haitham keeps one hand over Kaveh’s on his thigh, and with the other he reaches out to carefully slide his fingertips along the top of Kaveh’s throat, turning his hand so that he can feel across the bottom of the chin. Kaveh’s jaw is tight and Al-Haitham cups it in his palm, coaxing Kaveh into leaning into him, his hand, into slumping against his shoulder. Al-Haitham draws from the steadiness of the stem, the certainty of the root, the tranquility of the leaf that lingers at the shores of the mind, waiting and ready so long as he cares to look.</p><p>Kaveh has spoken of change, and Al-Haitham supposes that this <em>is</em> different than what they are normally like. It is a form of change, although he does not know what its final stage will be. But Al-Haitham cannot do more for Kaveh than this. He has learned that through years of learning Kaveh, and the past few months of gardening. Sometimes all one can do is extend a hand and wait. Sometimes, all one can do is trust.</p><p>“Do what you must to put your heart at ease, Kaveh, and then rest,” he says, eyes closing. He reaches back for the shores of mind, walking along the boundary between himself and the greener world. He speaks. “I am terrible at growing potato. I have potato <em>flowers</em> but I have no <em>potatoes</em>. I have sweet potato, too, but it’s just stalk and flower. Every time I attempt to check below the soil the things are pathetically small. I am certain I am doing something wrong, but I do not know how to address it. Nahida says I am being particular. I am <em>always</em> particular. This is not something new so I do not know why she is saying it only just now, in regards to these things…”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>After that night, Kaveh returns to his previous schedule — before it became strangely packed and fraught. He’s around the house more, and the time spent in his room is less frenetic, more paced. He has the energy to talk and show his face, at least. Kaveh picks up various household chores like he never stopped and the neighbors are no longer asking Al-Haitham about Kaveh, instead they’re asking Al-Haitham about Al-Haitham which is somehow just as annoying.</p><p>Kaveh is also no longer speaking strange nonsense, and Al-Haitham wonders if he should tell Kaveh about any of the peculiar things that he said when he was in that state of such extreme exhaustion.</p><p>Today Kaveh is helping Al-Haitham in the courtyard to build new shelves and to put up trellises. Together they are arranging pots, arranging stones and cinder blocks to elevate them and create better drainage. It is, supposedly, Kaveh’s way of thanking Al-Haitham for putting up with him for the past several weeks when he was essentially dead on his feet. </p><p>If Kaveh asked Al-Haitham if he needed the thanks, he would say no. But what Kaveh asked was if Al-Haitham needed help tidying the courtyard garden and Al-Haitham said yes, and the next thing he knew, Kaveh was measuring space and asking if Al-Haitham needed trellises and shelves and racks. </p><p>Al-Hathaim has been listening to the aunts down the street for too long, because Al-Haitham’s first thought was “Yes, but I can buy that” and then “Yes, and you need more sun and fresh air.” Thankfully, Al-Haitham’s mouth took over for the brain and simply said, “Yes.”</p><p>Now the two of them are in the courtyard, as much space cleared as possible as they put together wood that Kaveh had bought as Kaveh asks Al-Haitham about the different sort of plants and what they need while Al-Haitham also tries to think about what they might need and how to make all of it work in coordination in such a small space.</p><p>“Why don’t you have any flowers?” Kaveh asks while they paint a trellis a dark brown. Then, before Al-Haitham can point out that in order for there to be vegetables there must be flowers to pollinate, “I mean plants that are just there for the flower.” </p><p>Al-Haitham charitably ignores Kaveh’s muttered, “Pedantic ass,” as he shrugs and answers, “None of the plants or seeds I was given are flowers.”</p><p>“So if someone gave you flowers, you would grow them?”</p><p>“I would attempt it, yes.” Al-Haitham briefly wonders if the seeds Nahida gave him were meant to be flowers. He turns to look at it. The plant has stopped growing outward and seems content to secure itself to the wooden posts that Al-Haitham has carefully wrapped and bound it to. It has begun to sprout several leaves — pale green in clusters of three to five. The wood of the stem has turned dark and the thorns are disconcertingly sharp. He’s no closer to identifying what it is, although his list of what it isn’t has definitely grown. He has considered asking some of the neighbors who come over to talk at him if they know what it is. Al-Haitham is fairly sure at least one of them knows. But it would somehow feel like cheating if he did. He wants to unravel this mystery on his own.</p><p>“What kind of flowers would you want to grow?” </p><p>Al-Haitham shrugs. It’s not like he started this entire thing with a specific plant in mind. Aside from Nahida’s mystery, it is not about <em>what</em> is grown so much as whether it <em>can</em> grow under Al-Haitham’s care. The question of whether this activity is one that benefits his mind and body has been answered. But that was only one part of the experiment. This second part is not a question of want, but of capability and potential. </p><p>“Well. I suppose this is already nice,” Kaveh says when Al-Haitham doesn’t answer. “Is the experiment ongoing?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Sometimes Kaveh can be so easy. Al-Haitham doesn’t understand the parameters for when Kaveh thinks he should be difficult or when he should not be. Sometimes Kaveh digs into something and refuses to ever let it go. And sometimes he just nods and takes what Al-Haitham is willing to give without further question, like so. </p><p>Al-Haitham wonders if more of Kaveh’s gratitude is this easiness, or if this is just Kaveh being himself. He can’t ask, because if he asks, Kaveh is going to make a big deal of it. There are a lot of things that Al-Haitham wants to ask Kaveh, but isn’t sure how to approach without Kaveh turning defensive. Kaveh being defensive of a topic or stance is not something Al-Haitham normally avoids, but Kaveh has been strange for the past several weeks and Al-Haitham does not know what to do with <em>this</em> mystery. He isn’t going to go agitating the situation until he has a better grasp on it.</p><p>“Do you have the time for this?” Al-Haitham eventually asks, biting his tongue over the question of mora because Kaveh’s financial situation is perhaps the most stable it’s been in literal years due to the past few weeks of working himself down to the bone.</p><p>Kaveh is wiping down the small wooden table and chair that he had brought to set up in the corner of the courtyard where the kitchen meets the front room. The table is small and round, and there is only one chair. The fact that there is only one chair is an important one that Al-Haitham is trying not to look too closely at. Kaveh is too attentive to detail for it not to be important. </p><p>Kaveh pauses, finger tapping against the wooden surface of the table as he turns to squint up at the sky, mouth pressed into a fine line. They both know that Al-Haitham is curious. They both know what he is not asking about. This is how Al-Haitham is polite.</p><p>“Sometimes,” Kaveh begins, expression softening into something that reminds Al-Haitham of a healing wound. The skin has come together, but the faint line of what was a disruption to the natural state is visible. If one squints and has any form of experience with injury, one can imagine what must have been there once. The skin is pink and new, the scab is still firmly adhered, and there is still sharp sensitivity to the touch. “Sometimes, the only way through something is through the fire, you know? Just grit your jaw and get it over with. Or something like that. Don’t worry about it.”</p><p><em>Don’t worry about it, or is it not my place to worry?</em> Here is another question Al-Haitham does not ask of the tender wound, the source of which he can only guess; although the method for the healing is questionable. But he is not the injured one, nor is he the one who was sought for help, so it’s not his business to ask further. </p><p>And yet — if Al-Haitham does not worry, if Al-Haitham does not ask, then <em>who</em> will? Kaveh has relaxed his grip on his anxieties, he has let slip more of the details of his situation to those around him in slivers of the whole. But there is no one who knows the fullest picture of Kaveh’s life. Not even Al-Haitham, although Al-Haitham has been permitted to see some of the most unpleasant ones. Perhaps not even Kaveh himself understands the breadth of it. He certainly doesn’t act like it sometimes.</p><p>But if Kaveh will not speak of it then Al-Haitham can only be there to wait for an answer that may or may not be given, just like the rest of them. </p><p>Kaveh’s already soft expression melts further. He smiles. Al-Haitham looks away. Kaveh’s small smiles, like this one, are the sort that Al-Haitham cannot argue with. There is no angle of attack or suitable defense against them. </p><p>“It’s over,” Kaveh tells him, stepping around the table and the chair to reach out and tap his finger against Al-Haitham’s wrist. “There’s nothing to worry over, Al-Haitham. Don’t you see? I’ve made it through the hardest part. The rest is just…letting the river of time take me and seeing how it all comes to settle.”</p><p>“You must understand that is hardly comforting. Are you quite sure that between the two of us you’re the more empathetic one?” </p><p>Al-Haitham brushes Kaveh’s hand away from his wrist and directs him towards sweeping while Al-Haitham tidies up the pots of climbing vines and sprawling leaves.</p><p>As they move apart to their separate tasks, Al-Haitham wonders <em>what</em> exactly Kaveh as doing for the past several weeks, months, that caused him to be worked so hard and why, now, it’s all over. Why does it feel like things, in general, are back to normal? How does that level of demand rise seemingly overnight and then disappear just as neatly? Nothing in Sumeru is that tidy. Al-Haitham’s been working in the Akademiya for years and he’s never seen anything go that easily. It’s suspicious.</p><p>While Al-Haitham is trying to make guesses in the dark, Kaveh fills the silence with idle chatter about the classes he’s in charge of. He talks about grading and student projects and his role as an advisor. He makes no mention of any personal projects aside from his ongoing tutoring in Port Ormos, which he is now trying to make official and expanding as a Sumeru-wide pre-Akademiya program for children. He wants to establish a grant fund for it and he’s been talking with his peers and retired Kshahrewar professors to see if he can make it happen. He’s also looking for other Kshahrewar architects who would consider opening their own branches or assisting him because what he’s doing now is barely scheduled — Kaveh tries to go down there regularly, but Kaveh’s schedule has only truly stabilized within the past few months. And Kaveh hates being forced into promises he can’t keep.</p><p>Al-Haitham allows Kaveh’s voice to flow over and through him. And from within, he submerges himself into the soft waves of faint dendro that resonate from the plants through his Vision. He walks between the two, body and mind. </p><p>Through the ear, Kaveh speaks of the Kshahrewar’s public works projects and how there’s so much infrastructural updates that need to be done that it’s embarrassing to think of. Through that which Kaveh and Cyno and Nahida call the soul, Al-Haitham listens to the feeling of contentment, of satisfaction. He feels the sun on his skin, the back of his neck and the tops of his shoulders. He feels it along the slowly unfurling new leaves. He feels the flutter of a butterfly’s wings and the gentle bump of a bee — unsure if it’s with his own body or the body of the world.</p><p>And then he wonders — what would it matter, body of man, body of world? Where does one end and the other begin, for is he not, himself, a world? And arguably, the most pertinent one because it is the one he exists as?</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>Al-Haitham sways between the world inside of the body and the world outside of the body.</p><p>“Hey.” A hand presses to his body’s cheek and Al-Haitham turns into cool skin, eyes sliding closed. The hands smell of lingering paint, of soil, of wood shavings, and that warm-smell that seems to come from simply existing as a creature of warm blood. Kaveh laughs. “I’m getting dirt on your face.”</p><p>“Then get it off my face,” Al-Haitham’s voice says. A thumb traces a half-moon under Al-Haitham’s eye. Fingers push hair back and trail over the side of his head, his ear, returning to cup the cheek and jaw. “You smell like sun.”</p><p>“So do you.” The thumb taps against the cheek. “Did you know you’re starting to get freckles? Here. Here. Here. You’re warm, Al-Haitham. Maybe you should sit down.”</p><p>Al-Haitham turns away from the hand, finding that suggestion agreeable and sensible for once. There’s a distinct change in temperature when the body crosses from the center of the courtyard to the corner under the shelter of the roof with the little chair and table that was set up earlier. Al-Haitham sits, legs stretching out, hands folding in his lap, head tipping back as he sinks down, down, down. The air is cooler here, too.</p><p>Kaveh’s hand returns to brush Al-Haitham’s hair out of his face.</p><p>“Stop getting dirt on my face.” Al-Haitham focuses his eyes on Kaveh. Kaveh face is a different kind of soft, now. And this smile is wider, brighter. Al-Haitham traces the faint and forming lines at the side of Kaveh’s eyes. Kaveh is standing half in the shadow, half in the light. The shadows from the house cut him down the center, his face in the cool dark and his back brilliant in the light. “What?”</p><p>“<em>You</em> tell <em>me</em> what,” Kaveh replies, giving Al-Haitham’s hair a sharp, playful tug with his fingertips before he lets his hand fall down, trailing over Al-Haitham’s shoulder as it falls. “Don’t fall asleep.”</p><p>“I’m not.”</p><p>“No, I know you. Give you a good place to nap and you’re going to test it for your mental rankings of nap spots.”</p><p>“There are no <em>mental rankings</em> for nap spots.”</p><p>“Oh, is there a <em>physical</em> one, then?”</p><p>“Neither, I don’t rank places to sleep.”</p><p>“Sure you don’t. Either way, don’t fall asleep. The paint is almost done drying and then we can put up the last of the trellises.” Kaveh steps out of the light entirely, standing next to the chair, hand on the back of is next to Al-Haitham’s shoulder. “Hey.”</p><p>“Alright, now <em>you</em> tell <em>me</em> what.”</p><p>“You.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Hey, as in, <em>hey you.</em>”</p><p>Al-Haitham stares up at Kaveh. “I see. After so long without sun and fresh air this sudden exposure has you addled. That’s unfortunate.”</p><p>Kaveh rolls his eyes, sighing with unearned exasperation. If anyone should be exasperated it’s <em>Al-Haitham.</em></p><p>“I can’t just call out to you because I want to?”</p><p>“You weren’t calling out to me. My name isn’t <em>hey</em> or <em>you</em>.”</p><p>“Al-Haitham.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Al-Haitham.”</p><p>“I really am going to fall asleep if you’re just going to act like this.”</p><p>“Thank you.” Kaveh’s expression turns deep with sincerity. “I’ll even say it twice more if you want. I was <em>unbearable</em> for the past few weeks.”</p><p>“Clearly not,<em> I</em> bore it.” Al-Haitham tips his head back, feeling his neck and shoulders stretch as he closes his eyes again. “Wake me up when the paint dries.”</p><p>-</p><p>“He’s not here,” Al-Haitham says as soon as he opens the door and sees Tighnari on the other side. Al-Haitham’s not certain <em>where</em> Kaveh is today, just that it isn’t here, isn’t at the Akademiya, and probably isn’t in trouble. Or at least, not <em>yet</em>.</p><p>“I know, he’s with Collei and Senior Faruzan,” Tighnari says, nose wrinkling and eyes pinching at the corners. He sounds wryly amused as he continues to explain, “Senior Faruzan has decided that I’m a terrible influence and must be done away with so that the three of them can enjoy their day together. I think it’s because she’s trying to scope Collei out for the Haravatat and thinks she’ll have an easier time of it if I’m not present.”</p><p>This explains where Kaveh was and why he was especially meticulous in how he was dressed. Senior Faruzan’s eyes are very sharp. She’s like Nour Aunt and will take any opportunity to fuss. Except she’s worse because one can escape a neighborhood aunt by leaving the neighborhood. It is much harder to escape a senior member of the Akademiya when one is an academic.</p><p>This does not explain why <em>Tighnari</em> is here.</p><p>“Kaveh says you’ve been gardening,” Tighnari continues. And then, head tipping slightly, eyes narrowing. “I do not think that was meant to be a secret.”</p><p>Al-Haitham shrugs, “Do I seem the type to advertise? It is not. Though I am still confused as to <em>why</em> this is such an intriguing topic for everyone who happens to hear of it.”</p><p>Before Tighnari can respond to that Al-Haitham gestures the man inside, “Do not say it’s because it is me, and of course I would not understand it.”</p><p>“Alright, I won’t. In any case, I was curious.”</p><p>“You <em>are</em> a scholar.”</p><p>“I am. And I think Kaveh meant to direct my curiosity here, so that I wouldn’t be bored after being spontaneously uninvited from their gathering.” Tighnari’s eyes curve like moons, tail lazily swaying from one side of his body to the other. “This was a spontaneous thing only to him. Senior Faruzan had asked if she could have time with Collei outside of their tutoring sessions.”</p><p>“Does Kaveh not count?”</p><p>“I think Senior Faruzan thinks that his chances of converting Collei over to the Kshahrewar aren’t very good compared to her chances of converting Collei over to the Haravatat. And Collei wouldn’t take those attempts very seriously anyway.” </p><p>This is a fair point. Kaveh oscillates between pride in his darshan as an essential pillar to society and also being extremely serious about the dedication and mental fortitude needed to actually succeed within it. Kaveh’s attempts at recruitment for new Kshahrewar members are intense, to say the least. In this particular subject, Kaveh is a firmly grounded realist and would point out the flaws of his profession and school readily and without hesitation. It’s earned him more than one talking to from the Kshahrewar’s main faculty but Kaveh is unrepentant.</p><p>Al-Haitham leads Tighnari through the house and into the garden. Tighnari pauses in the doorway, ears at alert, tail going still.</p><p>“When Kaveh mentioned that you had taken up gardening, he didn’t say how deeply into it you were,” Tighnari says. “I am not quite sure what I was expecting to see, but I find myself surprised all the same. Do you mind if I…?”</p><p>Al-Haitham shrugs and Tighnari immediately walks into the courtyard to begin his investigations. Al-Haitham moves to sit at the table and chair, leaning his cheek on his palm, eyes half closing as Tighnari looks over the plants.</p><p>“He said it was an experiment,” Tighnari says, pulling off his gloves as he examines the stout, but determined fennel. “Cyno had mentioned that you were up to something, but he had not specified and at the time I hadn’t thought to question further.”</p><p>“It was an experiment,” Al-Haitham acknowledges before correcting, “Now it is simply a garden. Either way, everyone’s fascination with it is beyond me.”</p><p>He does not know what Kaveh has been saying of the garden, Al-Haitham’s garden. It would not be Kaveh’s fault for failing to describe it in depth or detail. After that afternoon when they rearranged things and put up the trellises and new shelves and the like, the plants have adapted to their new positions and their new posts with astonishing vigor. Between then and now, Kaveh and Al-Haitham built up a customizable structure on the side of the courtyard against the Divine Tree — a series of poles and wooden planks that Al-Haitham can move around and adjust to hang different pots and drape climbing vines over as needed. </p><p>Empty spaces left by the rearrangement of pots and shelves has begun to fill itself, nature once again proving how much it adores a void by swallowing it up and erasing it. Green has swallowed up and dominated the once empty space, transforming it entirely into something almost unrecognizable. If Al-Haitham was not the one who was making this space into what it is, he would have a hard time reconciling it with what it was. </p><p>Climbing vines and stalks are determinedly swallowing up the trellises, curling with the determination of a child’s determined fist to pull themselves up taller and higher towards the light. Pots and planters line every wall, some with space between them, but most in clusters to attempt to all get the same light and air exposure as the others. Every plant thrives, reaching outwards to grasp more of the world and expand into it. Some are flowering, flowered, or in the process of doing so. New shoots and stalks and leaves in paler colors slyly peak out from underneath soil and older vegetation. Vegetables in different stages of forming hang or rest with contentment. Butterflies and bees and all manner of insects come and go frequently, providing spots of motion and color to break up the four walls of green.</p><p>(If Tighnari was not here, Al-Haitham is sure that the birds would have been making themselves into little belligerent nuisances on the roof — for whatever reason, they’re sure to disappear whenever Kaveh or anyone else is around. But they have no issue with Al-Haitham being present. Sometimes, when he is out here, they come very close and stare at him, or they chase each other, diving so close to him that he can feel the movement of air from their wings.)</p><p>In any case, at this stage of things, Al-Haitham is no longer considering this as an active experiment. </p><p>The questions that Al-Haitham had sought to answer have been answered with consistent and repeatable results such that his certainty in his conclusions is nearly entirely secured. He has considered these answers and turned them over and over in his head, seeking out their flaws and coming to terms with them as they are. The answers have found their place in him. </p><p>There is always the potential for those answers to be proven wrong down the line, or for new factors to arise. But that is the same with most experiments and most theories. There are very few things in this world that have been confirmed and acknowledged as absolute laws — and what hubris it would be for Al-Haitham to assume that his own small theories about this little garden would be among them. As such Al-Haitham finds himself satisfied with the conclusions he has come to. His only hold out is Nahida’s mystery plant, which he remains curious about identifying on his own and is less an experiment and more of a puzzle.</p><p>The rest of the garden, much like the answers he had found, has settled into itself, and into him. Al-Haitham has learned it, has learned how each plant makes its own demands and makes its own reasoning, in their own unique ways. Further confirmation of Al-Haitham’s theories can fall as secondary, even tertiary, towards the further care and maintenance of his garden as a whole.</p><p><em>His</em> garden<em>, Al-Haitham’s</em> garden, because while Kaveh was the one to bring in the plants that started this entire venture, Al-Haitham doesn’t think it would be unfair of him to say that he’s taken it over. Although he has been sure to ascertain that Kaveh’s plants that started this whole thing have suffered no neglect. </p><p>(The mint plant gets a place of pride all on its own, thick and proud and unrepentantly aggressive in its attempts to smother everything around it. The green onions are comically tall and neither he nor Kaveh have had to buy green onion in several weeks, not with this one continuing to grow steadily upwards no matter how much they trim off it or how often. And the aloe has been sectioned off and propagated several times over in an attempt to control its size, but it remains as an eye-drawing collection of bright green among the smaller series of succulents and vegetables it’s been put with.)</p><p>As Tighnari makes his way through the garden Al-Haitham feels a strange feeling of unease. It is not quite a sense of being self-conscious. Perhaps it is more accurate to call it <em>apprehension</em> — which does surprise him. It is not often that Al-Haitham finds himself unsure about someone looking at something he has done. And it is not as though no one else has ever seen Al-Haitham’s garden. The neighbors come over every now and again to poke their noses in and Al-Haitham allows it because they give good advice and he’s learned how to play the game of getting someone to leave the house with produce and cuttings that he doesn’t want.</p><p>This far into things, Al-Haitham has finally learned the very <em>specific</em> sadistic delight in foisting off unwanted vegetation onto others without being similarly burdened. It’s the same satisfaction as winning a particularly interesting debate against a very skilled and well studied opponent. As there is a startling lack of the latter, Al-Haitham has to find his enjoyment where he can and makes do with the former. He’s started to win more than he loses, which is an excellent morale boost. And when the cost of losing is an entire basket filled with chilies that Kaveh can’t eat and Al-Haitham doesn’t want to eat in that particular quantity, the incentive to win is all the more present.</p><p>Dehya and Nahida have seen his garden. He has spoken of it, briefly, to Cyno, Nilou, and Lady Dunyarzad. He and Kaveh speak of it often enough — one of the few safe topics between them that comes up with regularity and without any hidden pitfalls that might lead into a fight. He does not recall noting any form of this apprehension when he spoke of the garden to them.</p><p>It must be because of who Tighnari is. Tighnari, one of the foremost leaders of the Amurta, leader of the Forest Rangers, and respected advisor and guide to the faculty of Pardis Dhyai holds a specific form of expertise that the rest of their mutual acquaintances do not have. He is a master of mycology and botany, of the study of ecosystems. What does Tighnari, with all of this expertise, see when he looks at Al-Haithams amateur attempts at cultivation?</p><p>Al-Haitham’s garden is not as precisely and neatly coordinated as the sort that are found in the scientific gardens and greenhouses like those in Pardis Dhyai. They are not nearly as efficiently and orderly set up as any of the gardens and fields in the Amurta research zones. Al-Haitham has been to Gandharva Ville and he has seen the Forest Watcher’s carefully tended gardens there, too. And he knows that his is nothing of the sort. His garden will never be any landscaper’s envy. That Kaveh hasn’t complained about it is something that surprises him even now.</p><p>He looks around the space, trying to see it from the eyes of the stranger. It would appear haphazard. Everything lives, everything seems to be doing well. But there is no apparent organization to any of it. Herbs and vegetables and succulents of all sorts mix together in varying configurations. Pots of different sizes crowd up together before there’s a sudden gap between. There are patches of wall, of floor, that go untouched by green, by clay, by stone and wood — unclaimed real estate as it were. Some pots, in the spaces where the plant’s main body has yet to take over, host even smaller pots carefully balanced and wedged in. </p><p>But when Al-Haitham adds into the image the context of his own understanding, he knows why it appears as it does. These are the places he has learned these plants to do best in through trial and error over the past several months. These are the configurations they excel in. He has not yet found plants that find those empty spaces agreeable. Al-Haitham has found the places his plants thrive in, and he has negotiated with them for each other as they compete for resources, managing them all so that they each get their turn and fair share needed to thrive as they do now. </p><p>This process of management and negotiation has been like filling in a blank page, something Al-Haitham is more than familiar with. Al-Haitham finds a strong and comforting link between this process and the one of connecting word to thought, negotiating the abstract into a more universally understood concept. It is like the connection of paragraphs to paragraph, coming together to create a cohesive whole that works together in harmony to express an idea or move towards a specific goal. Finding each plant’s place in this garden has been like taking up fragments of a sentence, of words, and arranging them to find the paragraph, the poem, the prose and thus the spirit behind the hand that wrote it.</p><p>When Al-Haitham first began this, Kaveh had asked him if this made him happy. He could not answer then. Al-Haitham can answer now.</p><p><em>Yes</em>. It makes him happy. Gardening and all of the processes it involves makes him happy just as a good research project, as a good puzzle, as a good challenge, makes him happy.</p><p>Gardening, learning through gardening, is something Al-Haitham has found himself enamored with. It is not simply about the soothing effect it has, but about something greater that goes both broader and deeper at once. Something that has grown intimately close to himself. </p><p>Perhaps this is the feeling Kaveh gets when he is making his blueprints, when he is taking an imagined thing and translating it into a form through a series of symbols and lines, that can be understood by others. </p><p>There is a strange sort of science to it, a formula, yes. And there is a soothing consistency to it — mix the dirt and the fertilizer, tamp it down, secure the seed and the root, ensure adequate water and light, be on alert for signs of disruption towards further growth, and then focus on maintenance.</p><p>But there is also an element of pure chance. Al-Haitham learned that early on. There are some seeds that simply don’t grow. Or some fail to survive far enough to become relatively stable. There are no two seeds that will grow the same way. Despite the supposed formulaic nature of the craft, trial and error persists every time. Instinct and gut feeling play a surprising role in judging progress and courses of action. And then there are simply just…losses where he has to accept that there was nothing that he was able to do. Sometimes a seed simply does not sprout.</p><p>And Al-Haitham has accepted this. He did not realize he had this sort of nature within himself. Perhaps this is something that he is also growing within himself as he grows this garden. Or perhaps it is simply a nature he never had a chance to discover, to unearth, until exposed to this specific set of circumstances — like a green shoot, waiting inside of the seed.</p><p>Unless Tighnari has advice or legitimate criticisms for things Al-Haitham has not yet figured out, Al-Haitham must reassure his apprehension that it does not really matter what Tighnari’s opinion is concerning the overall aesthetic and organization of the space. Al-Haitham did not begin this project with the goal of efficiency in mind, nor did he approach it from a professional stance. Armed with this knowledge, this understanding, Al-Haitham waits in peaceful and contented silence as Tighnari continues his examination. </p><p>Tighnari asks questions about the garden: why what goes where, how he’s grown that specific variant and what troubles he had while growing it, so on and so forth. Al-Haitham answers with the information he can, and conjecture where he falls short of fact. He is fully aware that he is lacking in technical awareness on the subject. But Tighnari does not make any comments on that. Tighnari answers Al-Haitham’s responses with observations or comments and suggestions, but nothing to indicate any form of disapproval or to indicate what he thinks of the place one way or another.</p><p>“You haven’t used your Vision,” he observes. </p><p>Al-Haitham shrugs. “It would defeat the purpose of the original experiment’s parameters.”</p><p>Tighnari, too sharp for anyone’s peace of mind, turns to look at him. He is the only one, out of everyone who’s spoken with Al-Haitham of the garden’s original purpose as an experiment, who has not asked <em>what</em> the original goal was or what his findings have been. Perhaps, with that one sentence, Al-Haitham has already given enough away that TIghnari can see through him to know without Al-Haitham elaborating. There is a reason why Tighnari was held in such high esteem, and deemed such a high risk, by the previous administration.</p><p>Tighnari smiles at him, wide and pleased and a little sly. Al-Haitham narrows his eyes. But Tighnari turns away again, tail swishing back and forth, back and forth, and doing nothing to hide his apparent amusement or satisfaction. </p><p>Al-Haitham feels Tighnari’s dendro Vision activate, the unique signature of Tighnrai’s elemental energy touching against the shores of Al-Haitham’s own awareness in the back of his mind.</p><p>“You’ve learned your land.” Tighnari puts his hands on his hips, soft and satisfied grin spreading over his face as he nods and takes another look around. “It’s not my place to judge you, so I hope you weren’t expecting me to. I can only come to you with what my own experiences are and what I’ve studied about these plants. But none of it means anything in the face of real world application and what you’re seeing with your own eyes. Every space demands new parameters and different judgement calls. Al-Haitham, you’ve listened to these plants, you have noted the wind and the sky, and you have minded the sun. I’m not saying this to be poetic — we can leave that kind of thing to Kaveh and Cyno. I’m saying it because I’m being entirely practical and serious. I can see the care and attention you’ve given to this space and it speaks more of you than you would probably care to hear about.”</p><p>That’s most likely true.</p><p>“If you know I don’t care to hear about it, does that mean you won’t talk about it?”</p><p>“Well, I had wondered, you know. You can’t blame me for that.”</p><p>Al-Haitham rolls his eyes and Tighnari laughs. “Tighnari, if you did not wonder about something I would strongly recommend you go to the Bimarstan. You’re citizen of Sumeru.” Al-Haitham pauses. “Also, I don’t think there is anyone in our circle who knows how to mind their own business.”</p><p>“That’s true enough.” Tighnari shakes his head in mock dismay. “In any case. When Kaveh told me about this, and when I heard a little of it from Cyno, you’ll have to forgive me, but in my mind you’re the sort who tends to a field of thoughts rather than flowers. So seeing this as it is came around as a solid reminder about making assumptions. I do notice you’re missing some of those here, by the way. Flowers, I mean.”</p><p>“There is nothing to forgive. You’re not wrong in your assessment of me. I am not the sort of person who’s nature would suggest ability or interest in this sort of thing. As to the flowers — everything here was given to me by someone else. Perhaps, in the experience of those others, it was wisest to start me out with these plants. I have heard that it’s somewhat more difficult to tend to flowers over vegetables and herbs.”</p><p>“Flowers can be delicate, yes. And they are not always as forgiving as most common herbs and vegetables.” Tighnari’s clear eyes study him, looking for something within him. Whatever that thing is, he must find it, because he continues, “Now that you’ve mastered the basics, maybe you find yourself up to the challenge?”</p><p>“Are you treating me like one of your students, Professor?”</p><p>Tighnari’s brows raise. “Would you say that you’ve surpassed the level of student in the field?”</p><p>“I am not quite certain if this is a subject anyone can graduate from,” Al-Haitham points out. “Should I call you Senior, instead?”</p><p>“A good answer. And please don’t. Save that for when you want to annoy someone.” Tighnari shakes his head, reaching into one of the pouches hanging from his belt, pulling out a small packet. “Lotuses. Nilotpala Lotuses. I think you’re familiar enough with these.”</p><p>Al-Haitham doesn’t point out that he doesn’t have anywhere to grow a lotus, and that if he were to start growing flowers it would probably make more sense for him to start with Sumeru Rose because those are bountiful and quite easy to cultivate, on a relative scale. He has the background in growing things out of dirt after all. Aquatic plants are something entirely new.</p><p>Tighnari points out a few plants scattered around the area. “A water feature could assist with your humidity issue. You’ve had to water and carefully shelter some of these — you’ve managed them quite well. But it must have been a very careful balancing act. It isn’t that hard to make a small pond or water tank to grow aquatic plants. If you set them up correctly with the right balance of plant types, they’re practically self-sustaining. And there are several native plants of Sumeru that only grow in water or near it.”</p><p>This sounds reasonable, and Tighnari has no reason to lie about it. He is the expert between the two of them, as well as an expert when compared to most of Sumeru. Al-Haitham’s eyes move from the small bag of seeds in Tighnari’s hand to Tighnari’s face. Tighnari doesn’t push further, he just holds the seeds and waits. Al-Haitham realizes that this is both an acknowledgement and a challenge. Here is what Al-Haitham has done, here is what he might do. Even as Al-Haitham realizes this, he finds himself mentally rearranging the courtyard to make room and trying to resort the shifting puzzle of plants by virtue of need. If Kaveh were here, he would say, “<em>You do adore a good challenge</em>”, to which Al-Haitham would say, “<em>Are we not scholars?</em>”</p><p>As Kaveh is not here, but Tighnari with his seeds is, Al-Haitham rises to meet him, taking the seeds in hand.</p><p>“Do you just carry seeds around wherever you go?”</p><p>“You’d be surprised how often they come in handy,” Tighnari laughs. “Also, lotus seeds can be a good snack if one is very hungry. I’ll send you some guides and some of my notes for how to construct a water garden and you can decide on how to proceed from there. But what are your initial thoughts? I think this area over here would be good placement, but you’d have to move these ones out of the way.”</p><p>The rest of the day seems to move by very fast as Al-Haitham and Tighnari work through the puzzle of rearranging the courtyard to adapt to a new variety of flora while keeping the existing plants as close to their ideal growing conditions as possible. </p><p>The satisfaction Al-Haitham felt from settling everything in place just a short time ago is overtaken with a new surge of curiosity. He had not even considered aquatic plants as something that could belong in a garden. A strange oversight for him to have — a few of the neighbors he’s visited have their own little ponds or large jars and miniature fountains. </p><p>(When Al-Haitham returned the favor of four watermelons with a bundle of mint as thick as his fist, and several tomatoes and eggplant, as he’d mentally promised himself he would, he was walked around back to the man’s garden where the man’s wife was feeding scrap vegetables to three very large fish in a carefully built pond that was partway risen out of the ground. Thankfully, the man had no spare vegetables on hand to foist onto Al-Haitham but did have some eggs from a very surly looking chicken that Al-Haitham didn’t mind taking. Al-Haitham, after all, does not have a chicken.)</p><p>Tighnari recommends that he check in with the Amurta’s public works division. A lot of people have water gardens, but as a byproduct of Sumeru’s climate they can quickly become a breeding ground for bugs. The Amurta has a stock of bug-eating fish that they give out for free to people with water gardens or bodies of water near them. They also give out free starter plants and sometimes have extra supplies depending on the type of water feature is being added.</p><p>“Fish on top of lotuses and who knows what else, you aren’t playing softly when you suggest a challenge. Should I be flattered at this assumption of ability? I am not doing a <em>full</em> water garden,” Al-Haitham says as he sees Tighnari out of the house. Tighnari had invited Al-Haitham to join him, Cyno, Collei, and Nilou for dinner. They could talk more about the new addition on the way. But Al-Haitham has enough to think about on his own, and he wants to have some time to himself to consider it and his next steps.</p><p>Tighnari nods, waving over his shoulder as he heads off in the direction of Lambad’s.</p><p>Over the next few weeks Tighnari and Al-Haitham send a series of letters back and forth. </p><p>Al-Haitham has decided on a simple construction. In theory, the simpler the construction, the easier it will be for him to determine where something has gone wrong when it goes wrong. And it is not a question of if something goes wrong, something Tighnari has been very emphatic on stressing, but when. </p><p>It will be rectangular with a small waterfall to make sure the water continues to circulate, above ground and longer in width than depth, perhaps up to the height of his knees. This should be both manageable and appropriate in size if he wishes to add the mosquito and bug eating fish.</p><p>When Kaveh spots Al-Haitham outside with string noting down measurements, and Al-Haitham explains the suggestion-challenge that Tighnari offered him, Kaveh offers Al-Haitham a few of his stone supplier contacts. Al-Haitham might not be buying in a large quantity, but there’s always smaller bits of discarded stone that people are trying to get rid of and those would be nice to place around and inside of the small pond.</p><p>“I knew you two would get along,” Kaveh says as Al-Haitham finishes out a quick concept sketch to send to Tighnari for his opinion.</p><p>“I’m very easy to get along with,” Al-Haitham agrees, causing Kaveh to let out a long, <em>long</em> sigh. Tighnari sends back a letter with a few suggestions for alterations to Al-Haitham’s plans, and includes a few pages of notes on some plants that he’s having trouble with back in Gandharva Ville, asking for Al-Haitham’s opinions. Al-Haitham doesn’t know why Tighnari would ask him, but he writes back ideas anyway.</p><p>All of this culminates with Nahida, sitting in the one chair in the corner, watching and helping read out instructions and tips she’s gleaned from her passive tie to the Akasha network, as he slowly puts together a raised pond on the wall just past the kitchen window, near the corner of where the house and the Divine Tree meet. It is not immediately next to but close to Kaveh’s window. Kaveh sleeps very lightly, but Al-Haitham knows that continuous sounds like running or bubbling water can relax or ease the mind. Perhaps it will work on Kaveh, where all else has failed.</p><p>As of late, Kaveh has been slowly cleaning out his room, which is a relief because Al-Haitham had seriously thought that Kaveh might get buried alive in there at the rate he was accumulating things. Kaveh’s been getting rid of old models, old maquette and mock-ups. He has been disposing of or donating old books and manuals, shredding up and burning his old and unused notes. Kaveh’s offered Al-Haitham first go of his spare materials (a few pieces Al-Haitham did end up taking, mostly some spare wire and smaller machine parts that he knows he can use for his headphones if they need minor repairs or alterations) before getting rid of those too. </p><p>Slowly, Kaveh’s room starts to be recognizable as an actual bedroom rather than an extremely cramped storage room. Al-Haitham can see the bed again — newly made with freshly washed sheets. Kaveh’s folded clothes are returned to their proper place in his wardrobe and dresser drawers. Books are placed on shelves instead of stacked on the floor and the few boxes of parts and materials that remain keep their contents neatly stored without any overflow. </p><p>Kaveh has also begun to donate some of his older clothes and various other objects that Al-Haitham can only assume Kaveh had previously only saved for sentimental value rather than practical use. Every time Kaveh leaves the house it seems like he’s taking something out with him. At the rate Kaveh is cleaning things out, Al-Haitham has begun to wonder if it was necessary for him to clear out space in the front room’s shelves for Kaveh at all.</p><p>(He <em>does</em> mention this to Kaveh once, and Kaveh is quick to fill those cleared out spaces with whatever’s left for him to get his hands on and seems to match the space cleared. Kaveh shoots Al-Haitham a smug look once that’s done for reasons Al-Haitham cannot even begin to understand, so he does not attempt it. Let Kaveh remain a mystery.)</p><p>Al-Haitham secures the aquatic plants. He plants the lotuses. He arranges the rest of the garden to accommodate for this new section and watches as the plants, the space, adapts — all of its many pieces finding their new places. </p><p>He writes Tighnari of his progress, not just on the lotuses, but on the rest of it. Tighnari offers to tell him about Nahida’s mystery plant but Al-Haitham declines. It wouldn’t be satisfying if he doesn’t figure it out on his own. And much like with his steadily growing competency with the water garden, there is a certain and specific type of satisfaction to be found with learning about that plants in small and careful, experimental, steps even though this is no longer an experiment.</p><p>Letters pass between him and Tighnari. Al-Haitham loses several rounds of Genius Invokation to Cyno, and it is only half true that he loses them because he hopes Cyno will stop asking him to play — the other half is that he just really isn’t good at this game. Al-Haitham writes out references for Nilou for places to go and people she might want to speak to when she goes to Liyue. Senior Faruzan takes Al-Haitham out for lunch that becomes dinner because they sit and talk about language development post Deshret era and the fusion of border-dialects with respect towards the Fontaine migration for several hours, the both of them walking away from it satisfied but also light-headed with ideas. Dehya asks Al-Haitham to check in on Lady Dunyarzad for her when he has time while she’s beyond the Wall of Samiel, and Al-Haitham ends up taking tea at the lady’s estate while they talk about Fontaine’s latest mystery thriller series. Layla takes a quick visit back to her village and brings him wine that her uncle made. Al-Haitham shares the wine with Kaveh and Cyno and Tighnari during their next game night and considers that his contribution to the evening.</p><p>Time inches forward along with the growth of leaves, the stretching of stems, and the anchoring of roots. The lotuses have sprouted up, spreading their pale leaves that have now darkened with age and satisfaction. The little brown-grey fish dart around in the shadows of those broad leaves, and Nahida gifts him a little snail. Al-Haitham points out that he doesn’t think she needed to procure him a water snail. Nahida points out that if she didn’t, he wouldn’t have thought of it.</p><p>Nilou’s departure date for her trip to Liyue is set, and she asks Al-Haitham to join her, Lady Dunyarzad, and Senior Faruzan in some last minute preparations. He doesn’t know what else he can contribute to this, he and Nilou had already spoken several times about what she might expect. He goes anyway and Senior Faruzan mentions to him that she heard that Kaveh has been requested for a large Kshahrewar job. She does not know the details, but she wanted to offer her congratulations and encouragement. Kaveh has been rather hard for her to find recently — busy as he is with his lectures and his consultations.</p><p>Al-Haitham wonders if this large Kshahrewar job comes with a large cheque. He has not heard of any large jobs or project proposals, but Al-Haitham’s office does not see every single piece of documentation the Akademiya processes. And if it’s large project still in the early stages of formation, it’s possible he won’t see it at all until the project is fully underway. </p><p>He does not ask Kaveh about this. Kaveh has always been defensive of his potential works, especially when Al-Haitham is the one doing the questioning. Years of criticism will do that, although Al-Haitham maintains that most of his comments are justified. Kaveh works below his worth too often and commits himself to things too costly. And all of this, always without fail, comes around to dog Kaveh’s anxieties as it unfolds to become true once again. Kaveh brings the problems onto himself and then argues that they are problems that he must have, that he must go through.</p><p>Although Al-Haitham will concede that for the past few weeks Kaveh has been doing much better in terms of committing his energy and apportioning his time properly. Better than Al-Haitham has ever seen him, in all honesty.</p><p>Perhaps, for the first time in Kaveh’s entire life, the man is slowing down. Kaveh has always been quick to fill his free time with hobbies, with projects, with ideas and thoughts and problems to solve. Al-Haitham, now, after this entire situation of Sages and gods and reformation, can understand the restless need to do something, anything, to be productive, to create a result, to do something tangible. In turn, perhaps it is Kaveh who is learning that idleness is not necessarily wastefulness; time is not always money, and money is not always worth the time.</p><p>Or at least, this is something Kaveh might <em>try</em> to be learning, accepting. Would that any path Kaveh chose to go down be so easy, so smooth. </p><p>One morning Al-Haitham finds Kaveh asleep in the hallway that leads from their rooms to the kitchen. He can hear the sound of bubbling water and the sharp cawing of duskbirds through the thinner glass of the hallway window. Kaveh must have spent the night out here pacing — restless and anxious — before sitting down and falling asleep right here. It would not be the first time Al-Haitham has found him like this. Sometimes Kaveh is face down in the front room, limbs uncomfortably askew over the divan like Kaveh couldn’t even care about comfort any longer. Once or twice, Al-Haitham has found Kaveh sitting at the kitchen table, head in his arms, or in the front room but on the floor, hands folded over his stomach, or collapsed over the table in the corner.</p><p>In previous times, Al-Haitham has left Kaveh to sleep, or doze, or — if the man was actually awake and just trying to grasp the faintest threads of peace — be quiet and wrapped into his own head. Kaveh would draw himself up and face the day on his own time.</p><p>On this morning, Al-Haitham stops and looks down at Kaveh’s face. Morning has not fully illuminated the hallway, the angle of the sun not quite capable of reaching them through the window. But there is enough of that morning light to call the birds to waking, and to softly paint the floor and opposite wall with streaks of colored light, filtered by the opaque stained glass.</p><p>Kaveh’s eyes are closed. His mouth is slightly slack. He is asleep, but not resting. His hands look like discarded things, long fingers half-way curled to meet palm in his lap. One leg is stretched out along the floor, the other is halfway folded, clumsy and inelegant. Kaveh’s long hair is loose, hanging around his shoulders and into his face in waves. </p><p>Whenever Al-Haitham finds Kaveh like this, there is always a moment of confused, alarmed, unawareness. </p><p>Kaveh is not recognizable like this. He is not anything familiar to Al-Haitham, and the sight of him looking like this always has Al-Haitham startled into full alarm. There is a moment when Al-Haitham’s eyes and his mind and his body see a complete stranger, a completely foreign and uninvited thing, where the strange most certainly should not be. It would be something like absently reaching over to grasp the cup of coffee just poured and instead closing your hand around a snake, or turning back the covers on the bed and finding a knife.</p><p>Or perhaps, it would be more accurate to liken it to walking down a familiar street, through a familiar flight of stairs, distracted by a book, by someone talking to you, by your own thoughts, and then suddenly missing a single step — stumbling onto the edge of the curb or a cracked bit of pavement, or losing track of that last stair. There is a moment when the mind lights with alarm, with fear of the known suddenly becoming unknown, of the familiar turning stranger. There is a moment when the mind cannot understand what has happened. The process of alchemy and transfiguration that had undone the route memorization and biological building of schemas is magical and terrifying.</p><p>In that moment of suspension everything is happening. Nothing is happening. You and your body do not know either. The world is balanced upon a pin, in limbo, in a liminal space of new and old, <em>yes</em> and <em>no</em>.</p><p>And then, before the mind and body can raise a defense, the foot finds solid ground again and all is well, nothing was ever wrong, and you are left feeling foolish about the drama of it all.</p><p>There is the moment when Al-Haitham looks upon the collection of shadows and colors, shapes and textures that makes up Kaveh’s unfamiliar form and fails to understand that this is the man that he has invited into his house, into the most private and carefully guarded part of his life. And Al-Haitham’s instinct is to attack, to strike while the guard is down and get rid of the invader into this space.</p><p>Then just as quickly as that violence, that defense in the shape of an offense, rises within him, that which Cyno or Candace would call the soul stays the hand. The moment of suspension ends. Al-Haitham looks and he sees Kaveh as he is and all of the fight drains out of him, leaving only the uncomfortable understanding: <em>Al-Haitham is the one intruding upon Kaveh.</em></p><p>And in all of these past intrusions, Al-Haitham has left. He has turned his face away and firmly put the moment to the back of the mind to be washed away into the unconscious in an attempt to protect Kaveh’s carefully kept privacy. Kaveh holds his vulnerabilities closer than his regrets, and he is even more protective of them than his ideals.</p><p>And Al-Haitham knows what it means for Kaveh to let himself be prone like that, to be vulnerable. Al-Haitham is not invited to these moments, he just happens to come across them like some voyeur. Here is where Kaveh, Master and Light of the Kshahrewar, son and friend, teacher and role model, lets the layers fall apart to reveal the mortal underneath. Here is where the man can finally, <em>finally</em> rest.</p><p>So Al-Haitham lets him rest, lets him exist as that Kaveh who is behind all the other Kaveh’s and yet is never seen, never known. Minutes later, hours later, Kaveh will wake and his body will hurt from whatever position he’d fallen into, and he will draw up all of those layers again and tuck away that vulnerable man and become whatever form of Kaveh suits the situation, the audience. If Kaveh is aware of Al-Haitham finding him like that, he makes no mention of it.</p><p>But today Al-Haitham stops, standing over Kaveh’s prone form that looks like some discarded puppet and looks at him. It could be argued that he is doing nothing wrong. He’s just looking. The hallway is a common space. If Kaveh did not want to be seen like this, he would not have fallen asleep here. Al-Haitham forces himself to look, to truly look.</p><p>In the thin light of the early morning, with the sound of waking dusk birds and the constant and reliable bubble of water, Al-Haitham looks upon Kaveh and forces himself to see.</p><p>Kaveh looks tired. He always looks tired. In every memory Al-Haitham has, there is always a ghost of this weariness that touches at the edges of Kaveh’s face. Al-Haitham should wake him. Sleeping slouched over like this will do Kaveh no favors. Then again, Kaveh might not be able to fall asleep again if he wakes, and Al-Haitham does not know when he fell asleep to start with. It could have been mere minutes ago. Hours ago.</p><p>He steps over Kaveh and unlatches the window, pushing it open just a little to allow more of that sound and to allow the morning air to and clear light to slip into the hallway. Al-Haitham’s only appointment for today is meeting with Layla and Senior Faruzan in the afternoon. Layla wants to get Nilou a farewell gift. Senior Faruzan wants to give Nilou last-minute advice. For some reason, both of them think he’s a good person to ask for guidance on this on.</p><p>He slowly sits with his back to the window, close but not touching Kaveh. Kaveh stirs briefly, but does not fully rouse. Al-Haitham closes his eyes and listens to the sounds of the garden. It doesn’t need him to look in on it constantly, not anymore, and he thinks that the plants would not begrudge him diverging from the established routine. He turns towards the river of green thoughts in the back of his mind, where self touches against world, and lets the current take him.</p><p>Al-Haitham wades into the waters of the world, his own legs stretched out as Kaveh’s are, his own hands as empty and waiting, but un-expecting. </p><p>Some amount of time later, in some measurement that Al-Haitham did not bother to track, Al-Haitham feels the touch of weight against his shoulder, and the touch of a hand, a finger, against his own, just barely noticeable.</p><p>They do not speak.</p>

<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>“When was the last time I made you mad?” Al-Haitham could not have possibly made Kaveh mad recently. Annoyed, yes, but not mad. Kaveh hasn’t had the time or energy to be mad at Al-Haitham recently.</p><p>Interestingly, Kaveh did not hesitate when he answered.</p><p>“Four days ago.” He did not elaborate on what Al-Haitham had done to make him mad.

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Al-Haitham begins to seed and plant the garden with flowers. There is no specific reason why he starts it only now, except that maybe now that he has proven that he can handle the basics and the practical, it might be time to try something a step beyond. Also, there are only so many types of vegetables he finds himself willing to put his hand to. It’s either this or get chickens, which for some reason is the suggested next course of action from pretty much everyone he’s spoken to. But he has a feeling that this is just people trying to foist chickens onto him and he’s learned his lesson about <em>that</em>. It’s going to be the sugarcane and the peanuts and the melons all over again. </p><p>Flowers, then, seems like a logical next step. The lotuses have not yet begun to bud and bloom, but they are doing surprisingly well with very few set-backs. The water garden, in general, is doing incredibly well. And Al-Haitham has noticed a surprising decrease in insects and increases in birds and other small creatures. The courtyard is transforming itself into an entire ecosystem.</p><p>As the garden transforms, Al-Haitham’s own interests turn towards something new.</p><p>Here is (if this were still an experiment) where Al-Haitham would mark a change in conditions that would signal a move from one stage to another and the further testing of parameters and scope of current hypotheses and stability of conclusion. As it is not an experiment anymore, Al-Haitham will simply say that it’s a move from practicality to…enjoyment. Fun. Leisure. </p><p>Frankly, all pretense of this being an experiment has been let go. </p><p>Al-Haitham’s written notes on the subject are more like daily log entries, which make them no different from some of his other personal notes. Al-Haitham should look into why so many of his personal experiment and research notes turn into introspections by the end of it. That can be its own project on its own time.</p><p>Nahida’s sporadic in-person visits mainly involve her snooping about his neighbor’s gossip and her perusing his personal library while he tries to get her to eat as much food as possible so he can have less food in the house. </p><p>This is not, to be clear, him <em>fussing</em> over her. It’s simply that physically speaking, there is only so much food that the kitchen and pantry are able to contain. Ignoring the fact that the ice box and the small underground storage are quite good at keeping some foods preserved, someone (<em>Al-Haitham,</em> apparently, because no one else will) has to acknowledge that food is in its nature perishable and has to be eaten before a set time or it will cause negative effects upon the body. Seeing as this appears to be shocking and dubious news to everyone he points this out to as they’re foisting food onto him, Al-Haitham’s only recourse is to push the burden of consuming this food before it rots onto as many other people as possible.</p><p>(Layla has never looked better fed in their acquaintance — they say that students either wildly gain weight from poor eating choices or lose it rapidly from stress. Suffice it to say, Layla is safely out of danger from both of these options now. </p><p>Al-Haitham’s relationship with his subordinates and fellow Mahamata ranking officers is never going to be particularly warm, but there has been a marked and exponential shift in attitudes when he walks into any room from the grudging or resigned towards curious and hopeful. In a way, it is like he is training or conditioning several dogs.</p><p>Senior Faruzan doesn’t even pretend; she shows up at his office once a week and he points her at a pile of dishes that she whisks away without comment. Whether she’s eating it all herself or using it to try and bribe people into becoming her mentees he does not know or care to know. </p><p>Cyno is actually using his official lunch break hours to eat now, which Al-Haitham didn’t know he was working through. And upon finding this out, Al-Haitham had to fight down simultaneous feelings of moribund abhorrence at the thought of someone willingly working through their mandated break period; deep, unfamiliar concern that wanted to manifest in the form of him rapidly clicking his tongue while shaking his head; and relief at finding someone who would relieve him of this flabbergasting abundance of food.)</p><p>In any case, all of the talk about the garden and Al-Haitham’s findings are superficial and only ever really get deep if he’s trying something new. She offers advice from things she’s gleamed from the Akasha and they reference Tighnari’s letters. Her still as of yet unidentified plant is tall and hearty next to the window of his study. If it’s going to fruit or flower, he expects it might do that next year instead of this one. He doesn’t think he’ll have any issue growing it from here, barring some truly unforeseen circumstances.</p><p>Al-Haitham will readily say that he’s doing all of this for fun and habit. Habit because the routine of tending and caring for the plants has firmly entrenched itself into him. The fun comes from the not-quite random element and the anticipation of what happens next.</p><p>With herbs and vegetables and other plants with more pragmatic use, it was easy to mark progress and whether he was doing adequately or not. Plants that exist without some form of product and exist simply to flower and propagate are slightly more difficult. As Tighnari said, they’re a touch more delicate. It’s a different test of Al-Haitham’s growing skill and understanding of gardening, one that he takes to carefully.</p><p>It is not hard to get plants for this purpose. Nour Aunt all but hurls an entire section of jasmine at him when she catches him considering the dense wall of vines that covers her house. Sumeru Roses are so common and easy to grow that he just pulls one out of the ground while he’s on his way back from a check in with Inspector Zara that took place on the road from Port Ormos to Sumeru City. He picks up regular roses as well, a climbing rose that takes to being trained to the trellis the same way the mint plant takes to being placed next to anything (aggressively and not well). </p><p>The work of training and binding them to the trellises to climb instead of growing wild and climbing over themselves is tiring — his arms are scratched and there are uneven pits on his fingertips where stray thorns and jagged leaves have caught against his skin. But it’s satisfying to imagine what they might look like once they have taken to the wooden supports, once they have filled it and woven in with each other. Al-Haitham’s mind casts itself forward, filling the nose with heady scent and the eye with the contrast of pale flower against dark beds of leaves and stems.</p><p>A neighbor gives him a pot with an unruly Queen of the Night, a non-fruiting cousin of pitaya. When it is given to him, there are already a few small buds attached. He’s strongly encouraged to wait for the plant to finish flowering before he attempts to prune it back into some state of order. </p><p>Al-Haitham finds himself staying awake in his study, looking out of the open window into the garden and glancing out every so often, tracking its progress towards flowering over the next few nights. On the night that it blooms, Al-Haitham knocks on Kaveh’s door and the two of them stand in the moonlight, holding the giant flowers in their palms. </p><p>The flowers are so broad that they have to use both hands to hold one flower, the petals proud and delicate, spreading and spilling out of their hands, over their fingers — the pale white of the innermost petals stark in the evening lights.</p><p>Kaveh holds one of the giant flowers in his palms, eyes wide with wonder. The night air is warm, heavy. Kaveh stands so close that their shoulders and elbows brush. The backs of their hands bump as they each hold a single flower in their palms. </p><p>Al-Haitham can hear the sound of the Corps of Thirty patrol that goes past their house on the way to the Akademiya. It is not so late in the night that the city has fully entered a state of nightly contemplations. If either of them looked up towards the square of night framed by the wings of the house, there would be the faint light of the city-center on one side, and on the other, the light of the closest street lamp shining bright to light the way in the heart of the nation of scholars. Night-flying birds croak and chitter above them. The pond gurgles. Leaves rustle with wind, with the movement of lizards and small creatures that only care to show their faces in the night.</p><p>“This is beautiful,” Kaveh says. The only lights come from their own windows and the night sky above them. Kaveh bows his head, raising the flower in his hands, like he is breathing it in. It has no scent. Al-Haitham traces the delicate petals with his fingertips as he lets it fall from his hands, carrying its own weight as it reaches for the sky. Kaveh is smiling, that soft smile, that small smile as he playfully taps the flower to watch it dip and spring back.. “Al-Haitham, this is beautiful. We have to remember this, when morning comes, when it is gone.”</p><p>Come morning the flowers are withered, bedraggled and brought low, facing only the ground. Al-Haitham cuts the withered blooms away and begins the work of cutting away the excess leaves and getting the plant looking somewhat manageable in size. Al-Haitham prunes away burned and roughly broken segments and carefully ties the remaining healthy portions to wooden stakes so that the whole thing is no longer drooping over but standing tall. There are no other flower buds.</p><p>There is an idle thought that comes to mind when Al-Haitham examines this plant. He is not sure where this thought comes from, only that it must come from somewhere because Al-Haitham does not just spontaneously think about things.</p><p>When the Queen of the Night blooms next, will Kaveh be here, still, to see it? Will he be here to hold the white and pink flower in his palms and remind Al-Haitham that they must remember the dream-like presence of it come morning? When all of these new flowers that he is adding are settled and ready to bloom, will Kaveh be here to see them?</p><p>This arrangement between himself and Kaveh is temporary in nature. This does not bother Al-Haitham overly much — the transient sense of it, the knowledge that at one point it must change, that Kaveh will leave.</p><p><em>No</em>. Al-Haitham frowns, brushing dirt from his hands as he straightens up from moving the Queen of the Night to its new position near the racks of hanging plants. No, he <em>is</em> bothered. <em>Yes</em>. Al-Haitham can admit that to himself. When Kaveh is gone, Al-Haitham will miss him.</p><p>But Kaveh — barring any truly irreversible circumstances or errors on either of their parts — will not be truly gone. Will he?</p><p>Al-Haitham knows this. Object permanence is something most people grasp by the time they are toddlers. Just because Kaveh is no longer living in this house does not mean that Kaveh is no longer in Al-Haitham’s life. People do not have to be in Al-Haitham’s immediate vicinity for them to be a presence in his life. </p><p>Look at Dehya. Look at Nahida. Look at his colleagues in the Mahamata. People come and go as seasons, based on their own personal tides and rhythms. As the moon waxes and wanes so too do the presences of people in each other’s lives. People part ways — Al-Haitham and Kaveh have parted ways before. They will part ways again. It is not a bad thing unless they make it so. It is not a good thing, even though Al-Haitham hopes that if Kaveh is leaving it is because he has reached a stable and good place in his life. Just like the sloughing of skin, the removal of a contact layer to reveal something slightly more vulnerable underneath, parting comes with a certain degree of loss no matter the circumstances. </p><p>Separation, in Al-Haitham’s experience, is not inherently bad nor good, it simply is. There’s no point in dwelling on it, because parting is inevitable. </p><p>What <em>does</em> deserve the consideration of his active thoughts is <em>how</em> the time together is spent. While Al-Haitham can, he should savor and observe what he can of Kaveh’s presence in this house until it is no longer Kaveh’s house. Just like with the Queen of the Night’s, Al-Haitham must live in the moment as it arrives, release it as it passes, and then preserve what he can of it when it has completed the action of passing into simply passed.</p><p>Besides, just because Kaveh does not live in this house does not mean that he is gone forever. Kaveh will not vanish into the ether as though erased like a stray pencil mark. Just as this garden will not cease to exist if Al-Haitham decides to stop tending to it, Kaveh and Al-Haitham’s connection to him will not be abruptly severed with Kaveh’s eventual leaving.</p><p>It is an act of effort. Gardening. Connecting. It is an act of voluntary, constant maintenance and effort put forward. It is the holding out of a hand and waiting. This is what they chose to ignore before, this is what they chose to refuse before. There is the mistake that was once made between them — walking, running, from each other and looking at the strange trails the other left behind only in the corners of their eyes.</p><p>Wrong was once done between them. Hurt was inflicted — mutually. Al-Haitham knows that blame rests on both of their shoulders for both the cause of the wound and the lack of reconciliation. It takes two, after all. It always takes two. Minimum.</p><p>Al-Hatham thinks that they have both learned, both changed, both grown. They both understand reciprocity and can recognize how it looks when it is shared between them specifically. They know each other’s limits, their harder and softer boundaries — they know how to cross them, navigate them, and accept them.</p><p>When Kaveh leaves this place, there is nothing that will stop Al-Haitham from going to look for him and vice versa. Once again, barring any truly unexpected and irreparable circumstances, Al-Haitham fully believes that Kaveh might <em>expect</em> him to. And if Al-Haitham did not (getting lost in his own rhythms, his work, his curiosities, his quiet), Kaveh would invite himself back in to drag Al-Haitham out anyway, as the man does with so many of their shared friends. Kaveh will not let them turn their backs on each other with finality again. Nor would any of their now shared group of friends. Al-Haitham would not let them. </p><p>And it would not, he thinks, be so bad to meet Kaveh out in the world under different terms. Different terms, ones where Kaveh is not balancing resentment and guilt, shame and pride, debt and dependence and all of those things in relation to Al-Haitham and the roof over their head and the walls shared between them.</p><p>Although Al-Haitham would admit that as of late, with the return of Kaveh’s time, mora, and energy, is a return of confidence. Kaveh’s resentment and guilt of many things has eased, neutralized. Kaveh does not carry as much of it as he used to. </p><p>It seems the more that Kaveh prunes from his schedule, the more that Kaveh gets rid of from his room, the lighter Kaveh becomes. The stronger. Kaveh is up to something, Al-Haitham can tell, but he can’t quite figure out <em>what</em>. Kaveh may tell him in his own time. Or perhaps he will drop a series of clues that will prompt Al-Haitham to ask.</p><p>After the lotus, the climbing flowers, and the Queen of the Night Al-Haitham’s collection of flowers grows first with mostly grown extras from others rather than seed.</p><p>Another neighbor gives him Four O’Clock’s that they had not been doing well with — the plant is in a semi-dormant, recalcitrant condition that gives Al-Haitham a surprising amount of satisfaction in reviving. Every morning when he checks on the plants using his dendro awareness, the Four O’Clock’s grow slightly more responsive until it is just as vibrant as the rest of the plants that are growing together.</p><p>Lady Dunyarzad gives him a plant that’s aptly called “Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow”. It is in the trailing end of its flowering season, but she shows him an example of what it will look like from her own family’s garden — a riot of flowers in different colors all on the same bush. With the blessing of Sumeru’s climate and its natural abundance of dendro energy, she hopes that his will take as well as hers and that it blooms on its own soon. In the land of dendro it is not unusual for plants to be active beyond their normal seasons.</p><p>He can only assume that she told Dehya, who told the rest of their strange group that he’s moved his attention towards flowers, because after that Cyno brings him Windwheel Asters seeds that Collei wanted to share from her friends in Mondstadt. The seeds are delivered with a joke that causes Kaveh to pinch the bridge of his nose when Al-Haitham repeats it to him later. Al-Haitham attributes Kaveh’s poor reaction to Al-Haitham’s poor delivery, and says as much.</p><p>“Trust me, it would <em>not</em> be funnier out of Cyno’s mouth,” Kaveh insists, the man’s own mouth twitching up at the corner as he watches Al-Haitham assessing his growing collection of pots to determine which one he will use for the Windwheel Asters.</p><p>Layla gives Al-Haitham an iris, and she can’t get the words out fast enough as she thanks him for all of his help. While Al-Haitham didn’t do it for thanks, he won’t turn down the plant.</p><p>Tighnari writes to Al-Haitham about the greenhouse he has in Pardis Dhyai and Al-Haitham writes back that he is not building a custom climate controlled greenhouse, and Tighnari jokingly (or Al-Haitham hopes he’s joking) writes back, “<em>Not yet you aren’t</em>.”</p><p>As Al-Haitham considers whether or not this is a threat, he finally successfully grows several sweet potatoes of a size worth cooking and eating. He celebrates this victory by passing as many over to anyone else as possible so he doesn’t have to look at them ever again. The neighborhood children are now avoiding him like they avoid Nour Aunt, which Al-Haitham thinks is an overreaction. Kaveh thinks Al-Haitham’s pettiness over sweet potato and the children’s reactions are comedic. Al-Haitham thinks that Kaveh’s pettiness over whether the “right” kind of laundry soap got bought last is comedic because apparently half the street agrees with Al-Haitham on what the “right” kind of laundry soap is. The other half think they’re both wrong, which still puts Al-Haitham in some form of majority. Needless to say, neither of them agree on the true comedic value of either topic.</p><p>Kaveh’s first year as a guest lecturer and professor is coming to a close in a few short months. As hard as he can be on his students and despite how exacting his standards are, Al-Haitham’s heard several high reviews of Kaveh’s classes. He is certain that Kaveh will be asked to return again, and perhaps given more classes to lead and more authority on campus. Meanwhile, Kaveh’s appeal for grants to fund Kshahrewar oriented training and tutoring programs outside of the Akademiya gets passed and a committee starts getting set up to put the program into motion. </p><p>Al-Haitham expects Kaveh to start piling on projects again, or to at least begin talking about ideas that he’s been holding off while otherwise occupied, but Kaveh does not. </p><p>Instead, he goes to Lord Sangemah Bay for a meeting. The morning of Kaveh lingers in the doorway like he’s trying to talk himself into or maybe out of going. </p><p>The only reason that Al-Haitham knows that Kaveh is going to see Lord Sangemah Bay is because Kaveh had spent all of last night pacing the front room. Partway through the evening (when Al-Haitham was annoyed enough to try and trip him just so he’d, perhaps, stay down and out of sight where Al-Haitham wouldn’t get dizzy just watching him) Kaveh stopped and knelt on the floor at the arm of the divan and put his head down next to Al-Haitham’s knee and said, sounding extremely pathetic — “Can you get me mad and then argue with me?”</p><p>To which Al-Haitham responded, “I could.” And promptly turned up his earphone’s noise cancelling.</p><p>Kaveh slapped his thigh until Al-Haitham turned them down again. “Okay, you got me mad. Now argue with me.”</p><p>Al-Haitham slowly moved his eyes from the puzzle box that Dehya had brought him — supposedly based on the mechanisms of a real puzzle found in some ruin somewhere in the sand, which was entirely vague and not at all helpful in narrowing down the type of puzzle he was trying to crack — and stared at Kaveh until Kaveh started to squirm.</p><p>“I’m busy.”</p><p>Kaveh plucked the box out of Al-Haitham’s grasp and without looking solved it in four expert turns of the hand, causing the mechanisms inside to click open turning the entire structure into a miniature flower. The both of them stared at it.</p><p>Kaveh went, “Cute.” And then he tossed the puzzle over his shoulder to harmlessly land and bounce on the cushions of the divan behind him. “Now argue with me.”</p><p>Al-Haitham was prepared for the puzzle not to last him an entire evening, although he very much wanted it to. He pulled out another one, this time one that Cyno had given him. This one was not really a puzzle or a gift, but a lock that was supposedly meant to be un-pickable. Al-Haitham narrowed his eye, held the keyhole up to his face and used his dendro Vision to concentrate some light into it. Then he carefully checked the tumblers one by one. </p><p>A bonus of his enhanced awareness of dendro energy that he did not anticipate is that his lock-picking has gotten much faster. A downside is that Cyno, who knows about Al-Haitham’s lock picking, keeps throwing him supposedly “un-pickable” locks and asking him to time how long it takes for him to pick them.</p><p>Al-Haitham is fairly certain he’s doing some part of Cyno’s work for him and is not being paid for it. But it frankly doesn’t take him very long to solve any of them, and trying to calculate how much he should be owed for any time spent on them is too much of a hassle. So Al-Haitham just picks the locks and settles for disappointment every time they turn out to be laughably easy to deal with.</p><p>Kaveh started to poke Al-Haitham’s knee. Slowly, cautiously, and when Al-Haitham ignored him, more insistently. Al-Haitham, annoyed and also somewhat curious as to <em>why</em> Kaveh would <em>invite</em> Al-Haitham to not just argue with him on purpose but also make Kaveh angry on purpose, jammed a rod of dendro straight into the keyhole and made a face of absolute disgust when the lock immediately clicked open. These manufacturers do not know what the word “un-pickable” should mean. He should set someone in the Mahamata on them for false advertising of some sort.</p><p>“Nice,” Kaveh said.</p><p>Al-Haitham pulled out another lock.</p><p>“<em>Not</em> nice.”</p><p>“What do you want?” Al-Haitham snapped. He angled his body away from Kaveh as Kaveh tried to snatch the second lock out of his hands, drawing his legs up underneath himself. As though making a smaller target could stop Kaveh when Kaveh had his mind on something — especially when Kaveh had his mind on something that was by most reasonable standards <em>unreasonable</em> in nature.</p><p>“Get me mad and then argue with me, how is that so difficult for you to understand? You do this to me practically every day.”</p><p>“When was the last time I made you mad?” Al-Haitham could not have possibly made Kaveh mad recently. Annoyed, yes, but not mad. Kaveh hasn’t had the time or energy to be mad at Al-Haitham recently.</p><p>Interestingly, Kaveh did not hesitate when he answered.</p><p>“Four days ago.” He did not elaborate on what Al-Haitham had done to make him mad. Al-Haitham does not remember arguing with Kaveh about anything or Kaveh behaving any differently.</p><p>“And when was the last time that we argued?” Al-Haitham asked instead, cutting Kaveh off, “<em>Actually</em> argued.”</p><p>Bickering, squabbling, picking at each other like dry skin did not count. </p><p>Here, Kaveh could not answer and looked surprised as he continued to cast his mind further and further back to try and find one. Al-Haitham, generously, waited for him to arrive at the conclusion that Al-Haitham already was at.</p><p>They had not argued in months.</p><p>“It is not,” Al-Haitham said as Kaveh’s expression slowly moved towards something bright, something tremulous but too large for the body to contain so it simply would not, “<em>Every</em> day.”</p><p>“I said <em>practically</em>.” Al-Haitham, still being very generous, did not speak of the waver and sudden rough quality to Kaveh’s voice. Kaveh unsuccessfully cleared his throat a few times, head turned down, almost shyly — still kneeling — before he looked up again, mask in place but thin and liable to be blown away by one wrong move. “I need to talk to Dori tomorrow.”</p><p>Al-Haitham turned over the lock in his hands, feeling the metal as it warmed beneath his touch — not trying to solve it, but just buying time for Kaveh to speak.</p><p>“It’s something important,” Kaveh says, picking at the seams of the cushion on the divan. Then he ran his hand through his hair. “I…I know it’s part of what she does, it’s part of her business strategy. It’s not that she’s doing it to be malicious or anything. But whenever I talk to her, no matter what I do, I somehow walk away confused and with half of what I intended and a lot of what I didn’t. She’s just like that, Al-Haitham. It’s not personal, she does that to everyone and it’s what got her so far, so fast, so young.”</p><p>Kaveh is the only person in the history of commerce to feel empathy of his creditor.</p><p>“She’s a little like you in that regard,” Kaveh mused. Al-Haitham scowled, not liking the comparison although he knew it was most likely a good one. “No matter what I do, she manages to slip past my defenses. It’s like when I argue with <em>you</em>. I get so caught up.”</p><p>Lord Dori Sangemah Bay is a shrewd businesswoman, Al-Haitham would easily agree to that. One could only wonder how much keener she would become as she grew. Al-Haitham supposes that most of his annoyance is because he, himself, can’t get any business with her. He’s never been able to get a one-on-one with her. Cyno has business with her and he’s the General Mahamatra. Nahida has business with her and she’s literally a god. Al-Haitham’s a simple scribe and he can’t even talk to one of her low-level clerks? What did <em>he</em> do to her to get such a strong blacklist?</p><p>“What <em>did</em> you ever do to her anyway? She clams up every time you come up in conversation.”</p><p>“Why am<em> I</em> coming up in conversation?”</p><p>“Did we not already establish that I talk about you?” Kaveh’s mouth twitched up at the corner and Al-Haitham watched as Kaveh flattened it again with visible effort and nerves. “Anyway, argue with me already. I need to get a warm up in.”</p><p>Al-Haitham turned to the lock in his hands and began to work on it in earnest. “Are you not planning on sleeping?”</p><p>Kaveh rose from where he was kneeling, pushing at Al-Haitham’s back, his waist, his shoulders until Al-Haitham moved enough for Kaveh to wedge himself in behind him. He was warm and solid. Al-Haitham found himself relaxing against Kaveh’s shoulder, Kaveh hooked his chin over Al-Haitham’s to watch Al-Haitham work on the lock. Al-Haitham slapped Kaveh’s inquisitive hand away when the man reached for the lock.</p><p>“I never plan on sleeping.”</p><p>“And that is why you always come out the poorer end of an argument.”</p><p>Kaveh’s annoyed exhale slid over Al-Haitham’s cheek and Kaveh dug his chin into Al-Haitham’s shoulder in punishment. And then he went still. Al-Haitham could feel dots connecting in Kaveh’s mind as he realized what was happening: <em>Kaveh was getting his way.</em></p><p>Softly, in that same fragile way he looked at Al-Haitham just moments ago, he murmured with his mouth pressed against Al-Haitham’s shoulder, “Thank you.”</p><p>And then he proceeded to snatch at the lock while refuting that sleep had nothing to do with it, and it was entirely his weaker ground in certain types of debate styles. Kaveh doesn’t argue with just anyone, after all. He is not nearly as querulous as Al-Haitham is, why are you laughing? Yes, yes you <em>are</em> laughing, what do you take me for? A blind fool?</p><p>Kaveh did not mention what he needed to speak to Lord Sangemah Bay about. At one point Al-Haitham, with four supposedly “un-pickable” locks unlocked, went to bed, leaving Kaveh to either sleeping or not sleeping.</p><p>This morning, Al-Haitham woke to Kaveh making a full breakfast using every manner of ingredient from the garden, from the pantry, from the little bits of leftover dishes, with a look of utmost concentration on his face. Mehrak was set to the task of moving dishes around on the table to make room. Kaveh did not speak, and he barely ate, which meant Al-Haitham was left with all of those dishes which he immediately planned on bringing to work. With any luck, he could catch Layla before her classes. If he could catch Layla then he wouldn’t have to talk to anyone else.</p><p>“Are you late on payment?” Al-Haitham asks as he watches Kaveh fiddle with his hairpins, knowing it isn’t the answer. Kaveh’s occasionally forewarned Al-Haitham about being late for rent or quietly asked for their friends to cover his tab and he’d pay them back at later dates. He always has. But for the past several months, Kaveh’s income has been incredibly steady, especially in comparison to his expenditures which were mainly only so high because he’d end up making up the difference between project budgets and his own personal standards. With most of Kaveh’s time occupied by the Akademiya and official Kshahrewar works, he hasn’t had much reason or time to spend money on anything.</p><p>“If I said yes, would you go easy on me this month? No. I’m not.” Kaveh bites the edge of his thumb, red eyes flicking between Al-Haitham and the door. “I…Can I tell you later?”</p><p>“Can you?” Al-Haitham reaches out and gives Kaveh a firm push between the shoulder blades. “Go. Tell me later. Or don’t. You aren’t going to be on her good side if you show up to a meeting you requested late.”</p><p>Later turns out to be the next week because Al-Haitham is dispatched with Cyno to check on progress in Aaru Village to make sure that there’s been no interference or mishaps in the ongoing reparations between the Akademiya and the Eremites, and that all of the correct funds and supplies were apportioned exactly as they were meant to and nothing went conveniently missing. Al-Haitham and Cyno do find traces of missing grain — but the error comes from the Akademiya side, so Cyno leaves early to get his Matra on that. Al-Haitham stays behind to take notes from on how the supplies that did arrive were utilized and what should be changed or kept the same. </p><p>When Al-Haitham returns to Sumeru City he’s swept up into an emergency meeting of the upper ranks of the Mahamata, which is not actually an emergency that would require them to mobilize, but just an announcement that Proctor Sofia is pregnant again and that her duties will need to be distributed amongst the rest of them as per their usual dividing of the work. This could have been a note, Al-Haitham says. Inquisitor Azusa, looking about as ragged as Al-Haitham feels, with their head down on the conference table points a finger at him and says, “What that guy said. Wake me up when it’s over.”</p><p>After the Mahamata meeting Al-Haitham has to catch up with his staff who were in charge of handling his duties while he was away. They did well enough, but there’s still a large amount of work that Al-Haitham believes they did not have to save for him, specifically, to deal with.</p><p>While this is going on Kaveh and several other Master Architects and Engineers were sent on an emergency dispatch to the Chasm to assist their counterparts in Liyue over repairs to mine shafts and railways that had suffered sudden and extreme damage due to a heavy rainfall and agitated Geovishap hatchling activity that will require further study, and something that can only be called poor fortune. The two groups had to work from each side to make sure that stability was reached and maintained on both sides of the Chasm, and then formal reports needed to be approved by both governments and all of the other parties involved.</p><p>By the time both Al-Haitham and Kaveh are back in the house at the same time and somewhat back to themselves, Al-Haitham had already put Kaveh’s meeting with the Lord Sangemah Bay out of mind. He does not expect Kaveh to bring it up, but Kaveh does in the middle of cleaning the front room.</p><p>Al-Haitham is in the middle of going through books for a very, very specific section of wording that he knows was used so he can show it to Tighnari. His only trouble is that the author he’s attempting to cite frequently refers to their older works in a variety of different ways so Al-Haitham has to look through all of them to remember which, exactly, used the phrasing he wants Tighnari to see. </p><p>Kaveh is wiping down the table in the corner. </p><p>All of the windows in the house are open. It is one of those rare days when the wind is good and strong — strong enough to overpower the heat and humidity and make everything feel fresh. They are airing out the house which truly needs it after a week of the both of them barely being present. From one side Al-Haitham hears the burbling of the pond, the agitated chirp of birds fighting and chasing each other. From another side Al-Haitham hears the sounds of people walking along the street in front of the house, lively with the wind. He smells jasmine from Nour Aunt’s house. Someone is cooking, the smell of it carried by the wind until it is a faint note that wanders into the house. The smell of it is distinct enough for Al-Haitham to know it exists, but he couldn’t possible say what was being cooked.</p><p>He can hear the dogs of the street barking — each one setting off the other, and then finally, annoying someone’s cat enough into its own vocal protest. From the direction of the commercial district, there is someone singing about sales, about deals, about quality, about fine craftsmanship.</p><p>“I renegotiated my terms of payment contract with Dori,” Kaveh says abruptly. Al-Haitham pauses in the middle of comparing two texts. When he glances over his shoulder, Kaveh is still polishing the surface of the table, long hair pulled up and away from his back and neck, held in place by pins and pencils. “There is a big project Kshahrewar that I am trying to sign on for. I will know if I got in by the end of the year. But it will require me to…make several changes.”</p><p>“Is it the one that Senior Faruzan heard about?”</p><p>Kaveh goes still, and his head snaps up to look at Al-Haitham. Across the mellow morning, through the sound of someone singing, “<em>Yallah, Yallah…</em>”, Kaveh’s eyes pierce him like an arrow, like a hyperbloom. Al-Haitham, already still, feels himself freeze in place. He forgets how intense Kaveh can be, although he does not know how he forgets, until he is pinned underneath Kaveh’s indomitable attention.</p><p>“You know what it is.”</p><p>Al-Haitham frowns, forcing himself to look away, to bare his neck, to turn his back. Why does Kaveh say that like an accusation? Like Al-Haitham has done him wrong? How can<em> Al-Haitham</em> remembering something<em> Senior Faruzan</em> brought up once be an offense he should bear?</p><p>“I know that there is a project. It is of some importance to the Kshahrewar. I know that you were a potential candidate, or you placed yourself in candidacy for it. It has not gone through my office and I doubt that it will. What am I supposed to know, Kaveh?”</p><p>Kaveh’s sharp eyes dig into the back of Al-Haitham’s neck like teeth. And then, abruptly, Al-Haitham feels the tension ease and he releases a soft exhale, eyes closing.</p><p>“Yes,” Kaveh says, voice betraying none of the tension he’d abruptly brought between them and then just as suddenly dismissed. “It is is about that.”</p><p>“So you are on it.”</p><p>“Yes. No.”</p><p>“You are the picture of eloquence and clarity.”</p><p>“And you’re a regular comedian — I. I can’t —Not yet. Alright? Not yet. Soon. But not yet. I’ll tell you. I want to — I want to tell you. But.”</p><p>
<em>Not yet. Soon. Not yet. I want to. But no. </em>
</p><p>What an apt and incredibly simplistic summary for Al-Haitham and Kaveh’s lives. The core of their lives, in relation to each other, sometimes seems to be based entirely around waiting. Not now’s. Not yet's. No’s. What does that mean for that all of those rejections, those deferrals, it seems that the both of them still remain to wait? What does it say about the both of them that they are somehow always returning to a cycle of extending a hand and grasping at nothing, or worse, grasping something dangerous and sharp, but they continue to hold the hand out anyway? What does it say about the both of them, about each other, that they are always reaching but most of the time never touching?</p><p>Al-Haitham snaps the books in his hands closed, returning them both to their places on the shelves as he returns to his hunt.</p><p>What does it matter what it says about them? What does it matter if a hand is held out and nothing is returned? What does any of it matter?</p><p>When it comes to Al-Haitham and Kaveh, Kaveh and Al-Haitham, what should any of it matter?</p><p>“So?”</p><p>“So what?”</p><p>“Did you manage to negotiate the terms? Or was that entire night of warm up pointless?”</p><p>-</p><p>Al-Haitham wakes and knows. There is no question to it, no uncertainty. Al-Haitham knows today is going to be uncomfortable — bad. He wakes and feels a sharp and unyielding barrier between himself and his body — not quite in place, but approaching like the way he knows the heat and the humidity of the day, will come. A restless and dangerous feeling rises like gorge, burning and itching all throughout his body, waiting to settle in to stay. </p><p>Al-Haitham is staring up at his ceiling. He is hearing the sound of water. He is hearing the sound of Kaveh in the washroom, splashing water on his face and brushing his teeth. He is hearing the sound of the pond through the open window in the hallway. He is looking at the shadows and the morning light over the wood where they have snuck past his heavy curtains.</p><p>But he is also not seeing, not hearing, not feeling anything at all. Al-Haitham’s mind is taking a step backwards. And then another. And then another as it observes the incoming fog and all that it entails. Al-Haitham’s hand clumsily reaches out and grasps blindly for the earphones waiting for him on his bedside table and slides them on, closing his eyes as he braces himself for the soft impact.</p><p>This is bad. This is an understatement. Words of a stauncher degree, however, have been swallowed up by the strangeness. So, for now, Al-Haitham can only examine himself and think: bad. Bad, but not unbearable. It is bearable because it must be. Because if it was unbearable he would not have made it through all of those other strange episodes and moods that have come before today’s. But he doesn’t <em>want</em> to bear it. He does not want to.</p><p>What is want in the face of reality, though?</p><p>Al-Haitham slowly rolls onto his side and then gets himself sitting up, then standing. As he does so, he feels like his brain is physically one step behind him, tethered to the body by a fragile collection of tissues that’s liable to snap at any moment. But at least, this time, Al-Haitham can tolerate the feeling of his earphones. The feeling of his clothes on his body is, for now, acceptable.</p><p>There is a part of himself that is still clear, still capable, that wants to turn back towards the previous few days to see what caused this particular episode to come upon him like so. There <em>must</em> have been a cause. Why wouldn’t there be a cause? This is an effect of something, is it not? And for there to be an effect, there must be a cause. It would not be reasonable for it to be so random, so spontaneous. The body is not a spontaneous thing. The mind is not spontaneous. This part of himself wants to tear through his memory, to interrogate and investigate. But there is not enough of it. There is not enough of him for it.</p><p>The majority of him is turned towards management, towards control. He is fairly certain that he could work like this. He has before. But he does not particularly want to. And surely there must be a reason why he has so much sick leave accumulated. Would it not be for this very purpose? Al-Haitham could go to work and be completely silent and semi-productive and still manage to turn out more acceptable work than half of his staff. But it would be incredibly taxing, and why bother to put himself through that? It is not as though he is still the Acting Grand Sage. The Scribe’s work can wait. It is hardly nation-changing. And if someone were to disagree — well. What would they <em>do</em>? Fire him? Who would that be a punishment for, exactly?</p><p>Al-Haitham does not know when some part of him — body, mind — makes the decision that it does not want to be present in this room any longer. But it must because when Al-Haitham focuses away from the idle wondering of whether he could outlast the Akademiya in a battle of attrition (he probably <em>could</em> as long as the matra didn’t get involved, and by matra, he means <em>Cyno</em>), he is standing in the kitchen. Kaveh has already left. </p><p>As he blinks, waiting for his brain to catch up to his body, Al-Haitham decides that it is a good thing that Kaveh is gone. If Kaveh saw Al-Haitham like this —</p><p>Al-Haitham reaches for the words and is unsurprised when they slip past his grasp. Al-Haitham’s lips and jaw remain closed, unaware of the signals that his mind is trying to send them — entirely oblivious to the fact that he is attempting to speak. Somewhere between brain and mouth, the connection is severed and all of the attempts at words fizzle out into nothingness. Silence.</p><p>The remains of Kaveh’s breakfast dishes are in the sink. Al-Haitham can see, but not hear, the drip of water from the faucet. Mechanically, he reaches over and turns the dripping off. There are plates on the table covered in undies linen to protect them from any stray insects. There is a note on the table. It takes Al-Haitham three passes of the simple words upon it for the meaning to sink it. After much reflection over his student’s current comments in class, Kaveh plans on canceling his advanced course’s class for the day and instead hold open office hours for any of them who need to discuss their projects or get assistance with their other coursework. He might come back early, or come back late.</p><p>The window to the garden is open. Al-Haitham sets the note down to close the window, before the heat of the day comes and sucks the life out of the house. But then, through the window, Al-Haitham looks into the multitude of green that lays out beyond in striations of morning light and man-made shadows.</p><p>Habit takes over for the absent mind, body carrying him out into the morning as he looks over the pots, inspecting leaves and stems for pests, testing soil with his fingertips. Al-Haitham’s more conscious mind follows him, always a step behind and feeling like it is floating like some child’s balloon. Meanwhile the mouth remains closed, the throat feels strangely blocked, and the rest of the body acts as an independent automaton set to some program he does not remember actively setting.</p><p>With the sound cancelling on, all Al-Haitham can hear is a strange echoing silence that is his own blood through his ears. He feels it more than he hears it. Al-Haitham flinches when he feels the displacement of wind directly behind him, turning to see one of those bold birds in the middle of chasing another. Lately hummingbirds have come over here to sample of the blooming flowers — there are houses that have feeders for them and much more in terms of flowers to feed upon. But the birds are fiercely territorial and Al-Haitham has watched them in clusters of four and five diving at each other. He supposes that his garden must be new territory to fight over. The buzz of their wings is more feeling than sound.</p><p>Slowly, carefully, Al-Haitham lowers the volume of his earphones and then takes them off. He stands in the middle of his garden feeling strange, feeling odd.</p><p>Sound comes back into him and he is snapped half-awake, half-back into the body by the feeling of his bare feet on the unswept stone, the relatively cool air that has not yet fully warmed up with the morning sun, and a strange prickling all over his skin that seems to grip him by the back of the neck and hold him still. The unpleasant, uncomfortable disconnect is still present — hovering at the edge and waiting for a chance to return and wash over and through him.</p><p>At the back of Al-Haitham’s mind is a river. A river of thoughts. And beyond the river is another body — bodies of green that make no sound and are somehow only sound. And it reminds him of one of the many reasons why he has worked on creating that greener body, creating a space for it, right here in his own home.</p><p>The original purpose of this garden, the original question of this garden, was to see whether or not it could be relied upon as grounding for these episodes of nonsense-too-much-sense that come over him. The act of tending had worked when nothing else did that first time, all of those months ago, with the half-dead mint and aloe and onion. Since then he has not had an episode as strong as that one, but in times when sounds and touch began to border on too much; when his mind seemed too large and cavernous for the limited spaces of his body of flesh; when the words seemed to stop and lose all motion just before they could hit his throat; Al-Haitham has found himself here.</p><p>He has found himself standing in the garden, and he has found a certain level of comfort that simply just standing here, while solving nothing, did make things tolerable enough for him to endure until he could find his way out of the strangeness back to something familiar and more capable. It is something about the routine, he thinks.</p><p>Speaking of routines — Al-Haitham’s body turns and retreats back into the house. He watches, simultaneously outside and inside of himself, wishing that he could commit to one or the other instead of this half-state, as he washes his face. He brushes his teeth. He changes clothes. He is not hungry, but he knows that he must eat. Al-Haitham’s body uncovers the first dish, sees eggs gone cold, almost gags, and covers the dish again. The next dish is cut fruit, which are put into the body’s mouth and slid down the throat one tasteless bite at a time until it is all gone. That will have to be good enough. Al-Haitham goes through the motions of tidying the kitchen and putting away the dishes and the extra food, the entire time, teetering between himself and not-himself.</p><p>The body goes back into the garden. Al-Haitham, after food and after the comfort of turning towards a familiar routine, feels a little more anchored to his body. Although, perhaps, the feeling of being more present should be attributed to the uneasy feeling of something in the stomach. It could be both. Al-Haitham’s hands open and close, restless. </p><p>How terrible it is, to be half-himself, half-not-himself, half-here, half-somewhere else. If it could commit to one or the other, he could handle it instead of this not-this, not-that. Al-Haitham does not like existing as not-things. Al-Haitham is fine with being contrary. But not like this.</p><p>Al-Haitham moves around the small space of the garden, attention flickering between one thing to another, unable to settle. His earphones sit on the table in the corner, waiting. But his body says to him, “Not silence. Not noise. Not blood. Not air. Not this. Not this.”</p><p>Al-Haitham drifts in and out of himself as he dusts dirt from his hands. The uncomfortable feeling that lingers, barely held back at the edge of the borders of himself, surges like waves on the shore. As Kaveh so aptly put it once, sometimes the only way out is through. </p><p>The sun moves overhead and he retreats to the shade of the house, feeling a noticeable dip in temperature near the little pond. As he approaches he sees ripples of water where the small bug eating fish dart to the surface to nibble at nothing before chasing each other. The water gurgles at him. Al-Haitham slowly sinks onto his knees, and then is turning with his back to cool stone as he stretches his legs out before himself. His feet and shins stretch into the light, the rest of him in shadow.</p><p>He closes his eyes and puts his attention to the sound of water. Not silence. Not noise. Not blood. Not air. This, then. This. Al-Haitham turns his mind to the water as he allows the rest of himself to be encased in the strange disconnecting fog. The only way out, sometimes, is through.</p><p>There is a river of thoughts in the back of his mind. He crosses it to the space on the other side and is enveloped in the world of green things, bloodless but living things. Voiceless things that are not silent. Al-Haitham breathes in the greener world and exhales through the red-blooded body. His hands slide together in his lap and his fingers are strange to his own understanding, strangers to his own palms. But he holds them anyway as he relinquishes control over the understanding and awareness of time.</p><p>Somewhen around the hour he supposes he might start being noticed as missing, he feels something against his ankle. Al-Haitham’s eyes open. The world is blurred. Unfocused. The light is too bright. He squints just enough to make out the shape of a sparrow.</p><p>In the green world, something deeper and larger than life itself seems to bore down upon him.</p><p>Al-Haitham’s body shivers and that greater-than-living retreats. But he knows without it being there what has just happened. </p><p>The sparrow lightly tugs at the hem of his pants and then flies away, soundless.</p><p>Al-Haitham closes his eyes again, sinking into the feeling of the world around him while his body is incapable of tolerating the feeling of itself.</p><p>When Al-Haitham surfaces again, the air is hot, stuffy with the heat of the day fully present and settled in over Sumeru. His body is starting to sweat.</p><p>Kaveh is kneeling in front of him. Watching. Waiting. Al-Haitham casts his mind around for something to say and comes up predictably empty-handed. His mouth remains closed and ignorant of its ability to be of use to communicate semi-complex concepts through manipulation of sounds. Kaveh just nods, somehow managing to understand without Al-Haitham so much as twitching a finger, before he holds something out to him. Water. Al-Haitham’s hands reach out and take it. His body drinks it. He waits for Kaveh to say something but Kaveh does not. He just takes the empty glass back and nods at Al-Haitham, turning and walking out of sight. Al-Haitham watches him disappear into the house.</p><p>Al-Haitham waits a little bit longer, but Kaveh does not return. So Al-Haitham stops waiting, closing his eyes and falling away again, wanting to move and get out of the heat, but also finding incredible comfort in the sound of water behind him and all of the green that sways and grows and thrives. The water Kaveh brought him was helpful. That Kaveh asked no questions was merciful.</p><p>Every time Al-Haitham steps back across the river of thoughts to attempt to re-enter his own body, something has changed — the light, the temperature. Sometimes a sparrow is nearby. Sometimes not. Sometimes there is more water. Sometimes there is food. Al-Haitham drinks the water. Some of the food must make it into his body because he can feel the weight of it. Al-Haitham attempts to move, but mostly just finds himself tucking himself closer and closer to the sound of water and the cooler shade of the house. </p><p>Every time Al-Haitham steps back across the river of thoughts to see if he is welcome in his own body again, he stays a little longer. His body welcomes him back grudgingly, in increments, until finally he is awkwardly seated within his own skull, feeling his limbs like they’re articles of clothing that were taking off of someone else’s body.</p><p>It is early afternoon, or maybe late afternoon. Morning is over. Night is not yet here. </p><p>Kaveh, this time, is sitting next to him, long legs pulled up with a sheaf of papers on his lap, backed by a wooden board. His pencil goes <em>skritch-skritch-skritch</em> across the coarse, cheap paper. After a moment of consideration, Al-Haitham decides that the sounds are not unpleasant. Kaveh does not speak. Al-Haitham blearily glances at the paper as his eyes adjust. Kaveh is working on a doodle of Mehrak scanning a lizard. Al-Haitham lets his eyes follow the movement of Kaveh’s pencil and trace his lines. Kaveh draws a little speech bubble from the lizard that says,<em> There’s you.</em></p><p>He sets down the pencil, reaching for something on his other side, and holds out to Al-Haitham the earphones. Al-Haitham looks at them for a moment, considering, raising a tired hand and pushing Kaveh’s away. Then Al-Haitham tucks his hands underneath his arms, holding the limbs tight to his torso. He is not yet ready to acknowledge that he exists in skin, with nerves and cells. It’s too exhausting right now. But he doesn’t need the absolute silence just yet, not with the backdrop of the water and the sound of Kaveh’s pencil.</p><p>Miracle of miracles, when Al-Haitham focuses, he feels his jaw and tongue shift and move. It’s grudging, it’s cumbersome, but they move. He breathes in through his mouth, testing the tension. He mouths a few words to the air before breaking the silence.</p><p>“Work?” Al-Haitham manages to push out through the repairing connection of brain and mouth. His own voice confuses him, sounding too far away despite the fact that he can feel his mouth shaping the sound.</p><p>“What are sick days for?” Kaveh replies after a moment, attention now returned to his sketching. Al-Haitham’s earphone pieces sit in Kaveh’s lap, kept against his belly at the bottom of the wooden board that Kaveh is using as a drawing surface. “I cancelled classes altogether and told my students to focus on their end of term projects because if they thought I was grading hard then I don’t know what word they’d use for the standard I’m going to consider for their final. Weirdly enough, I think I’ve just become their favorite professor for that. I was planning on cancelling anyway, so don’t think too hard on it. Besides, I got a lot done, myself. I had office hours open for a little but no one came.”</p><p>“Who told you?” </p><p>“I suppose that Lord Kusanali told Cyno, because I don’t know how else Cyno would know. And Cyno told me.” Kaveh taps his pencil on his arm. “I spent most of the day cleaning out some more of my stuff. I found some interesting things, if you feel up to looking.”</p><p>Kaveh turns to face him fully. “There’s also something I want to talk to you about, but I’m not quite sure if now is the appropriate time. But it is also something I’ve been putting off for a while and you, of all people, deserve to know about it directly from me.”</p><p>Al-Haitham sighs, slowly pushing to his feet and walking into the house, “Is it important?”</p><p>“Yes,” Kaveh says, quickly gathering his things to follow after Al-Haitham. “Very.”</p><p>“Then tell me,” Al-Haitham rolls his shoulders, trying to stretch his neck. “I’m going to bathe and then eat. Show and tell me whatever it is afterwards.”</p><p>“You’re in an off-mood.”</p><p>Al-Haitham turns. Kaveh is standing in the doorway to the garden, the sun at his back and the darkness of the house making it hard for Al-Haitham to read him clearly.</p><p>“I’m tired,” Al-Haitham replies. “But I am still myself. Or is it bad news that you’re trying to tell me? If so, rip off the bandage and don’t bother being gentle.”</p><p>Kaveh lets out a long, sigh, shaking his head. “I don’t know why I expected anything else from you. Alright, alright. Off with you, then.”</p><p>One bath and some amount of food that he can somewhat taste later, Al-Haitham sits next to Kaveh in the front room feeling more like his body is his own rather than some collection of borrowed parts that needs to be broken in. His earphones are on at half power and his mouth seems as though it is fully connected to the rest of his body. Most importantly, Al-Haitham’s brain feels as though it has settled back into the cradle of his skull as though it had never left. Al-Haitham is not sure if he’s relieved it was all over so (relatively) quickly and easily or annoyed that if it was going to pass him like such, it had to come about at all.</p><p>Kaveh has a small wooden box — plain and unmarked — in his hands. He’s carrying it carefully, like whatever is inside is fragile. Al-Haitham waits as Kaveh holds the box in his hands, thumb running over the edge before he opens it. The box contains what looks to be several letters. Kaveh must have already read them all, because his hand moves towards the back of the box, pulling out a worn envelope. Kaveh sets the box to the side, holding the one envelope in his hands before holding it out to Al-Haitham.</p><p>Al-Haitham takes the paper. The handwriting is unfamiliar, but neat. It slants to the right. It takes him longer than it should to recognize the name of the sender, the name of the receiver. Once Al-Haitham’s mind clicks the names together he almost drops the envelope in surprise.</p><p>“I found this,” Kaveh begins, “As I was cleaning out more of my things. It was with my mother’s belongings. I must have taken it with me when I sold the house and forgot to send it off to her. I didn’t realize what it was. I must have thought it was just more knick-knacks or something of the sort.”</p><p>Al-Haitham’s hands don’t shake as he opens the envelope, but it feels like something inside of himself is stretched taught, vibrating with tension and ready to spring. </p><p>There is a very old, very worn photograph — so worn that the edges are thin and frayed and parts of it where it had been folded have turned white — inside with the letter. Al-Haitham slides the photograph out. The kamera that took the picture was old, although he’s sure that at the time it must have been very new and expensive. The image is grainy, the color of it more brown and ruddy red than any other colors. Al-Haitham looks at the faces captured in blurry perpetuity.</p><p>“Imagine,” Kaveh says softly, “Even back then, we were linked to each other.”</p><p>“I do not need to imagine,” Al-Haitham points out, “The evidence is right here.”</p><p>In the photograph there is a man who looks very much like Al-Haitham. There is also another man who looks very much like Kaveh. The sender of the letter was Al-Haitham’s mother. The receiver of the letter was Kaveh’s mother.</p><p>Al-Haitham has no true memories of his parents. He thinks he has a few, but he cannot discern if they are real events or imagined ones, created from fragments of story and anecdote and idea to feed fantasy. He had always been told that he was very much like his father, in both looks and temperament. His grandmother had a faded portrait of his mother and father from their wedding, a lock of his father’s hair from when the man was a boy, and several softly spoken stories. But he had never truly connected any of those things to a real man, or to himself. Even now, looking at this photograph, Al-Haitham isn’t quite sure how to feel, how to connect to this.</p><p>There is surprise here, yes. And curiosity. But other than that, Al-Haitham does not know.</p><p>“They’re all between our parents,” Kaveh says, drawing Al-Haitham back. Al-Haitham turns towards him, towards the box that Kaveh has now placed between them. “This is what I wanted to show you. And now…”</p><p>“Say it.”</p><p>Kaveh’s fingers pick at each other, his sharp teeth dig into his bottom lip. And then Kaveh’s shoulders pull back and he raises his eyes to Al-Haitham’s.</p><p>“I’ve been getting rid of and cleaning out a lot of my things. You’ve noticed that. I know you have. Al-Haitham. I told you that I needed to make changes. I needed to…reevaluate things about myself, what I’m doing, about whether or not the things I’ve been doing have truly served me or if I just told myself that they did. Part of this…part of that has been acknowledging that I have carried my grief and grievances with me for so long. Too long. I don’t quite know how to fully let them go, even now. They feel pivotal to me, essential. I’m not quite like you, in this way. I hold onto things, but I do not accept them. I do not move on from them, not really. What I cannot bear to hold onto, I push away. You accept it all — better or worse, bitter and sweet, foul and fair. You accept it and make it part of you. And you make it look so easy that sometimes I resent you for it. You make me feel foolish, dramatic and weak, in comparison. Even though I’m the only one doing the comparing.”</p><p>“I know.” Al-Haitham frowns. This is not new to him. This is not new to Kaveh. Or at least, Al-Haitham didn’t think it was. They’ve argued over similar points several times over their years of knowing each other — usually using harsher words, louder voices, and sharper gestures of hand. </p><p>“But.” Here Kaveh pauses. He does not look away from Al-Haitham, but he pauses, hands gripping each other tight in his lap as his spine and shoulders pull back further until he is sitting up straight and tall, eyes bright, face cracked open like a wound opening itself up, tearing itself up. “But you know that I have loved you. That I <em>do</em> love you. Yes. I have resented you. I have mourned you. But I also — within me, <em>that</em>. There is too much in me, so much so that it pulls me in too many directions and sets me back even as it carries me forward. All progress made is at the cost of something else and thus I go nowhere.”</p><p>Al-Haitham puts the photograph aside before he accidentally crumples it.</p><p>Yes. Al-Haitham knows this, too. He has known it. They are not the type of people who say this sort of thing. They are both people who know, very keenly, the power of words. Just like the word “bad” fails to properly encompass the strange feeling of not-self that sometimes washes over him, the word “love” does not completely encapsulate everything that passes between the two of them. The word “love” is too small for all of the wars that they have waged against each other. It is too benign for the forgiveness and acceptance that they have put on the table between them in the name of armistice and further progression.</p><p>Loving Kaveh is like loving the sword, the flame, as it cuts and cleans. There is hurt. There is repair. There is the removal of something poisonous, something infected to save the greater whole. There is a learning curve and a sudden, irreversible demise, if proper attention is not given. There is a respect and an awareness for the other’s ability to wound and ability to defend, and there are the scars from when they have handled each other recklessly.</p><p>But love is not what saves them from each other. Quite frankly, it is what drives them apart most of the time. Love has nothing to do with what Kaveh is trying to bring up and they both know it.</p><p>“This is not what you wanted to tell me.”</p><p>Kaveh shakes his head in confirmation. When he speaks again, Kaveh’s throat clicks once, twice, before he manages to continue. “I am learning, slowly, to address things that I had refused to look at directly years. And part of it is understanding and acknowledging the terrible, the wrong, the resentful, the ugly. It is understanding that these things are things that are just part of nature, and that them being part of me does not make me any less than anyone else. These things, while unpalatable, are not unforgivable so long as I handle them with appropriate care. I am learning, Al-Haitham, how to be forgivable. And part of this incredibly uncomfortable process is carving a space within my own mind where I am permitted to be ugly and hurt, and therefore, with acknowledgement of this, actively choose to address and heal it. And this must begin with the poor habits that I have formed, the points of views I have adopted towards myself and others, and. Well. All of the other things I have chosen not to talk about.“</p><p>Slowly, so slowly that Al-Haitham isn’t sure if it’s actually happening, something inside of his mind slides into place. And then another. And another. All the while, Kaveh speaks. Now that he has started, he’s gained the momentum to carry him through the fall.</p><p>“It is — It is <em>incredibly</em> difficult. It is incredibly hard. It is quite possibly the most<em> uncomfortable, painful, and downright unnerving</em> thing I’ve ever done in my entire life. It was easier to push it away and ignore it, but I am tired of ignoring it and carrying around the weight. I’m too old for this. I refuse to do this for the rest of my life. This can’t be it for me. I <em>refuse</em>. I refuse that. I refuse to be <em>this</em> until I die. I don’t <em>want</em> to be tired anymore. I am <em>tired</em> of being tired. And I am <em>furious</em> about it, too, because I don’t think I’m ever truly myself if I’m not at least a little bit fed up and ready to fight about something that matters.<em> I matter.</em> <em>This matters.</em> I am tired of just hoping if I work hard enough on other things, the other problems will solve themselves. I am tired of treating my daily choices as penance for a crime no one has ever blamed me for committing. And now I’m rambling so I’m just going to say it — Al-Haitham. I am moving to Fontaine.”</p><p>Al-Haitham does not know when he looked away from Kaveh’s face to watch the way Kaveh’s hands have gripped each other so tightly they’ve turned pale. But when Kaveh says this, Al-Haitham’s eyes fly back to meet Kaveh’s. Kaveh’s eyes blaze out of his face, which has gone ashen. Like he’s about to throw up.</p><p>“Before the beginning of the next academic year, I am going to move to Fontaine as one of the professors in an exchange program. I will be teaching at their conservatoire and working on a long-term technological exchange program.”</p><p>Like stars in the sky, all of Kaveh’s previous actions for the past several months blink into place to reveal the greater constellation. This is why Kaveh has not picked up any new side projects. This is why Kaveh was in such a rush to finish all of his existing ones, as well. This is why Kaveh pushed so hard to establish an official Akademiya sponsored tutoring program that would take over his work. This is why Kaveh needed to renegotiate terms with Lord Sangemah Bay. This is why Kaveh has been getting rid of so many of his belongings. This is why Kaveh has been so anxious — throwing himself at so much while at the same time clearing his schedule. This is the big project.</p><p>There is a lot to speak of, to address, here. Logistics, the general timeline for this and all that came before it. There are questions. But the one that springs to Al-Haitham’s mind first is —</p><p>“Will you talk to your mother?”</p><p>Kaveh, somehow, manages to look even more ill. Al-Haitham reaches out a hand to steady him as Kaveh’s shoulders sag. </p><p>“You always ask the questions I don’t want you to. <em>Really</em>? That’s the one you’re going to open with? Yes. I think I’ll have to. I’ve written to her — about it. She’s very excited. Is it strange to you, Al-Haitham? Because it’s very strange to <em>me.</em> I’ve lived my entire life looking at uncomfortable things and trying to choke them down without tasting them even if I don’t accept them or otherwise acknowledge them. I’ve never had problems with people criticizing my work and I’ve fought for my ideals and philosophies. But in <em>this</em> incredibly specific field — in this one, I have dodged it for over half of my life. Did you know that I’ve never even spoken to her new husband? Al-Haitham. Do you think I am a coward?”</p><p><em>Kaveh</em>? A <em>coward</em>? Al-Haitham can’t help it. He laughs.</p><p>Kaveh squawks, face moving so fast from pale to bright red that Al-Haitham has to laugh harder. For the first time today, Al-Haitham feels light. He feels fully himself, every part of himself in complete and total agreement and content about their consensus. Al-Haitham from body to soul. <em>Here</em> is something to be entirely confident in.</p><p>“Kaveh. If you are a coward, then bravery does not exist.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>From Liyue, Nilou has found Inazuman texts supplemented with further anecdotal notes, on bonsai. Miniature trees. She has been away for only a month and she’s been sending everyone they know a letter with a small gift every week. She writes to them in cycles. </p><p>First to get letters were Lady Dunyarzad and Layla. Then Cyno and Dehya. Now Al-Haitham and Senior Faruzan. Every letter contains something different so everyone asks everyone else what they were told. Except Al-Haitham. He gave his letter to Kaveh to deal with, but it has not stopped anyone else from finding him and talking at him about what they read in their own. Nilou comes back in another month and a half, and Al-Haitham is sure that there’s going to be a large gathering where everyone is present to ask all of the questions to ever be asked. Why can’t they all wait until then to talk? It makes no sense to him.</p><p>But he does appreciate the books Nilou sent back. Although he does not appreciate the idea that she’s potentially sending him more work. Al-Haitham’s garden, suddenly and all at once, has kicked off into a veritable riot of inter-plant contests for space, sun, attention, and his personal esteem as the greatest trouble. And knowing how everyone talks, now everyone is asking him if he’s going to start growing trees. Al-Haitham had just said that there was no room for trees. And then they all pointed out that bonsai are small trees, purposefully kept small and continuously shaped and pruned and trained into manageable configuration.</p><p>Al-Haitham said that if they were so interested then <em>they</em> could take up the craft. He was quite busy with the fact that his roses were being strangled by jasmine; the mint was trying to throttle the fennel; the lavender was suddenly fainting dead away for reasons no one could discern other than the lavender; and the damned bitter gourd plant was throwing some sort of <em>fit</em> that involved everything on its left side wilting as though under watered and everything on the right being perfectly fine.</p><p>“Now that,” Nahida says when Al-Haitham tells her of everyone’s sudden interest in trees, sucking a leaf of mint between her teeth, “Seems <em>interesting</em>.”</p><p>“Did you put her up to that?” Al-Haitham asks. Because he is now wondering if the seed she gave him was for a tree. </p><p>Her mystery plant is currently in the middle of launching a takeover of the entire wall it’s next to. He is approximately eighty-eight percent certain he knows what sort of plant it is. At first he thought he knew what it was with ninety-nine percent certainty. Except now it’s behaving quite aggressively so he’s gained some doubts. The plant, shrub, possible tree, has grown thick and aggressive, its thorns mean and its leaves dense — the wood of its main base is a dark red-purple, and it is growing out and out and out. If he had known it would grow so large he would not have bothered with the climbing roses or the jasmine, or any other climbing plant. </p><p>The plant has grown so large, so dense, that it no longer needs any type of support. But Al-Haitham can’t even rip out the wooden stakes he’d used to initially prop it up because the plant has grown so thickly around them that it’s basically like trying to rip something out of someone’s unwilling hand. Birds have taken to nesting in the plant’s dense foliage — not while he’s in the middle of trying to tame it into something manageable, clearly. When he is not in the middle of cutting and binding the great mass of it down, he has looked out of the window or door to see sparrows sticking their heads in and out of the leaves.</p><p>“It would be nice for you to have your own fruits,” Nahida says.</p><p>Al-Haitham turns to look at her over his shoulder, sweat dripping down his neck, his back.</p><p>“You want me to make you something that involves a fruit.”</p><p>Nahida kicks her small feet, pretending at being an innocuous child while having the gall to look at him with the eyes of a several hundred year old god. She was not always like this. Al-Haitham is fairly certain that Nahida was not this mischievous, not this bratty before. This is someone’s influence upon her, but he cannot say who’s. It certainly is not <em>his</em>. It must be Cyno, somehow. Or the Traveler, but the Traveler is not even in Sumeru often enough for that.</p><p>“If you want fruit there’s an entire street of people who throw them out their door for free,” Al-Haitham points out. Al-Haitham has purposefully begun to avoid turning, facing, or even acknowledging that the entire left side of the world exists after opening his door, lest he suddenly be asked if he’s changed his mind on keeping chickens, if he knows who’s been feeding that one extremely vicious stray cat, or if he’s hungry. The answer to all three is no, but that’s not stopped anyone from continuing to ask him anyway.</p><p>“But aren’t you quite <em>curious</em>?” Nahida presses. “Doesn’t it seem like quite a <em>challenge</em>?”</p><p>Al-Haitham exhales through his nose, pushing hair out of his face with his wrist. </p><p>“You cannot get me to do things by calling them <em>challenging</em>,” Al-Haitham says. But now that she’s pointed it out, he has to acknowledge that it <em>does</em> sound like a challenge. It also sounds like work, but here he is covered in smears of dirt and shallow scratches all the way up his arms anyway. What’s one more thing? No miniature tree can be worse than Nahida’s mystery plant of thorns. </p><p>Al-Haitham begins with a potted lemon tree that looks very pathetic and almost entirely dead. This one is already too large to train and grow into a bonsai, but it’s still a tree so when it dies no one will be able to say that he didn’t make an attempt.</p><p>“I feel as though you are trying to cheat yourself on a technicality for reasons I can’t and don’t really want to try understanding,” Kaveh says as Al-Haitham attempts to find a place for the tree in the garden. “Where did you get that tree from? If you wanted a tree we could have gotten you a better one.”</p><p>“I don’t want a better one.” </p><p>“I don’t think that’s up to you,” Kaveh says, ominously.</p><p>“It’s my garden,” Al-Haitham points out, futilely.</p><p>Kaveh laughs, the sound of it startling some birds and a lizard. Al-Haitham tries to ignore the urge to turn around and flick a dendro shard at his face. A harmless one, mostly. Too many people are taking too much enjoyment from Al-Haitham’s garden. It’s been almost an entire year and for some reason the novelty of Al-Haitham having a garden has yet to wear off. Everyone who knows about it is entirely too excited to hear about even the most mundane of updates. Al-Haitham does not understand it — surely it’s not <em>that</em> interesting.</p><p>The lemon tree, against all odds, refuses to die. It even sprouts one whole new leaf within the next week. The one single new leaf makes it look more pathetic but also, in Al-Haitham’s eyes, spiteful.</p><p>Meanwhile, Kaveh returns from somewhere and the first words out of his mouth as soon as he opens the door is, “Don’t get mad. If you must be mad, don’t get mad at <em>me</em>.”</p><p>Naturally, Al-Haitham turns his sound cancelling up all the way, turns around, and goes to his study.</p><p>Unfortunately, this does not cause whatever problem Kaveh brought with him to solve itself. When Al-Haitham emerges from his study around an hour later to begin preparing dinner, Al-Haitham opens his door to a small tree right in front of his door.</p><p>Al-Haitham puts in a truly unnecessary amount of spices and chilies into dinner.</p><p>“I said don’t be mad at me.”</p><p>“When did I ever do what you tell me to?” Al-Haitham replies, mollified but only slightly by how red Kaveh’s face has turned and how much Kaveh is sweating. “Where did you get the tree and why did you put it directly outside my door?”</p><p>“I didn’t want to mess up your garden by putting it in the wrong place, and I didn’t want you to ignore it,” Kaveh answers, fanning his face. “It’s a cherry tree. It’s not from me, it’s from Senior Faruzan.”</p><p>“Why is Senior Faruzan giving you a tree?”</p><p>“She’s giving <em>you</em> a tree. I don’t know, maybe it’s a sign for you to go and talk to her. Maybe you annoyed her the last time you talked.”</p><p>“We were talking about you.”</p><p>Kaveh squawks, eyes going wide, cheeks coloring. “You talk about me?”</p><p>“Yes. So?” Al-Haitham frowns down at the miniature cherry tree that he’s put by the door while he tries to figure out where in the garden it’s going to fit. “Where did Senior Faruzan get a tree?”</p><p>Kaveh and Al-Haitham build another set of shelves, taller and wider, this time for the small trees that Al-Haitham has now begun to attempt to train and keep small — lemon tree aside, which seems torn between spiteful recovery and pathetic lingering. The cherry is joined by orange, peach, apple, olive, and pomegranate. Al-Haitham was not aware that the trees could be kept so small and still fruit, but then again it is not like Al-Haitham ever paid much attention to this topic before. Of the non-fruiting variety is a cypress and an azalea. </p><p>They are small enough, at least, that they aren’t competing for too much space with any of the other plants that have overtaken the space of the garden. And Nahida was not wrong in assessing them as a challenge for him to tackle. There is something very interesting about taming and training trees. It is entirely different from binding vine and stem and stalk towards trellises and stakes — the suppler, more flexible types of plant grow quickly, agilely, always reaching outwards for the sun in astounding curls and sweeps. But the trees grow much more slowly and they stay fixed once grown. Al-Haitham must consider the shape they will take with much more care.</p><p>If anything, the variety in color and plant height is something interesting to look upon.</p><p>But Al-Haitham has to draw the line here, otherwise there won’t even be room to walk.</p><p>The end of the Akademiya’s school term comes to a close. Senior Faruzan brings Layla and Collei out for dinner, grudgingly inviting Tighnari but also implying that he should not come. Tighnari and Al-Haitham spend that time in Al-Haitham’s garden talking about what projects Collei and Layla might get given by Senior Faruzan. They talk about flowers, which leads Tighnari to talking about the research of one of Collei’s friends in Mondstadt on Whopperflowers. Talking about Mondstadt leads Tighnari and Al-Haitham into talking about the artist Calx, a name Al-Haitham recognizes although his interest is primarily in the content of the books accompanying the man’s illustrations, and Mona Megistus. </p><p>“You know a surprising amount about astrology,” Tighnari says.</p><p>“She writes very well,” Al-Haitham replies. And after an entire year of assisting Layla on her work has given Al-Haitham new appreciation for the famed astrologer’s articles. He’s gone back to reread old issues with fresher perspective.</p><p>They’re still talking (this time retreated to the kitchen, discussing the decline in quality of academic journals which Tighnari believes to be an issue of lack of review time due to the several events that have happened over the past year or so and Al-Haitham argues has been a long-time coming even without the entire overthrowing of the Sages and their subsequent replacement) by the time Kaveh returns in the late evening. He looks pleasantly surprised to see them still talking, at which point the both of them realize how much time has passed and Tighnari hurries off to make sure Senior Faruzan hasn’t abducted Collei for good.</p><p>“You two really are getting along well,” Kaveh muses, eyes pleased as he takes Tighnari’s vacated seat, leaning forward to rest his head on his folded arms. </p><p>Kaveh’s preparations for moving to Fontaine have taken up much more of his time than expected, in ways that no one could have truly predicted.</p><p>The more practical matters have been settled. Kaveh is not going alone, he is going with a group of students and other professors and a few diplomats. Most of Kaveh’s things will be staying behind. Al-Haitham will keep them, for now, in Kaveh’s room. Neither of them are sure if Kaveh will move back into that room once Kaveh’s year in Fontaine is over.</p><p>But Kaveh has confirmed that he will not be staying in Fontaine permanently. His home, he had said insistently, is Sumeru, Sumeru City. Kaveh is going to Fontaine in order to find closure, and to open different doors, to face something so that he might put it away and take up something new instead. But he will return. Fontaine is a step in a journey of changes and self-reflections that Kaveh must undergo, but it is not his final destination.</p><p><em>Sometimes</em>, Kaveh said with a wry twist of the lips that betrayed his nerves, <em>the only way through is through the fire, through the water, and that is all there is.</em></p><p><em>By definition</em>, Al-Haitham said while holding out a hand for the tape they were using to pack up some of Kaveh’s books that he wanted sent ahead, <em>You must leave something in order to return to it.</em></p><p>Kaveh knows exactly what he needs when he leaves and is ready to pack them the day before. Kaveh has gotten new clothes commissioned and they are sitting with his incredibly spiteful tailor right now for adjustments. Kaveh is saving finishing packing all of his things for the last few days before his departure.</p><p>Meanwhile, Kaveh has been sure to keep himself busy. Kaveh has bought and begun tooling a set of spare external parts for Mehrak that he hopes will help with Fontaine’s incredibly damp surroundings. Kaveh has also requested data files to update Mehrak’s coding to be able to more easily process the languages and dialects of Fontaine.</p><p>His paperwork is arranged. Fontaine’s conservatoire and colleges have already settled the matter of lodgings and food for the most part. All of his projects that he wasn’t able to finish in that period of mad-cramming and rushing have been successfully passed off to others and by all accounts the handovers have gone quite well. Kaveh has settled his smaller debts and Lord Sangemah Bay’s larger one has been successfully renegotiated to allow for the greater distance his payments will have to travel and the adjustment in his income for the next year or so. Kaveh, while in Fontaine, will be unable to pick up on any independent commissions.</p><p>The true surprise is that now that word of Kaveh’s leaving has been officially announced, there seems to be a never ending stream of callers trying to squeeze in one last meeting with the Master of the Kshahrewar before he departs for Fontaine. Clients and patrons, former students and members of his cohort, partners from previous projects, sponsors, even just people he’s only met a handful of times want to meet with him for some form of well-wishing, some type of last goodbye. Kaveh rarely has to pay for anything as he’s constantly being asked out for breakfasts, lunches, dinners, every form of meal in between. Kaveh returns with gifts ranging from flowers to ink, parcels of mora to rare materials.</p><p>“I can’t get rid of it fast enough,” Kaveh jokes as he makes arrangements for a gift of Noctilucous Jade to be transferred from himself to Dori. “Where was all of this when I wasn’t leaving?”</p><p>In between these last minute appointments, Kaveh has taken extra effort to spend time with their friends. This includes the Traveller, who will be going with the group headed out to Fontaine as they’ve already been spending time over there and has — quite predictably — made friends in high places in their short time in the hydro Archon’s court.</p><p>Kaveh and Al-Haitham go over to Nour Aunt’s house and suffer under her attentions. More Kaveh, than Al-Haitham, as Nour Aunt attempts to fit an entire year’s worth of fussing and lecturing into one afternoon. Kaveh’s eyes somewhat glaze over partway through and Al-Haitham escapes to her garden while she insists to Kaveh that he must keep his mora pouch tucked into his underwear for safe keeping because thieves are everywhere and they’ll be looking to target foreign boys like himself. </p><p>One of the houses on the street opens their doors and windows for another one of those large street-wide gatherings. Kaveh and Al-Haitham both attend. Although Al-Haitham is kept in the relative safety of the kitchen, helping prepare ingredients for chutney. And then he’s permitted to mind the stove and fry food. Kaveh is mercilessly dragged between groups inside and outside of the house, thrown through several different rounds of chatter and will wishes and gossip. They return home with both of their arms filled with food, their ears filled with noise, and their heads with so much information about people they don’t know that they don’t exchange words for the rest of the evening.</p><p>The produce war continues as different plants come into their season, leaving others to quietly recuperate for the next round of warfare. There is a sister down the street who goes hunting frequently. Recently she traded Al-Haitham an entire brace of rabbit for one of Al-Haitham’s pots of aloe. Apparently her son somehow managed to kill the one pot they did have — not through any neglect, but apparently he’s in the pre-entry course for the Spantamad and there have been several accidents. This causes him to comment that perhaps he should pick a darshan that isn’t as exposed to fire. The woman threw her arms up into the air, cursing, “That is what I said exactly? Does he listen? No. Now he has no eyebrows! What am I to do with a son with no eyebrows? No eyebrows, no girlfriend, no boyfriend, no job! I’m going to run away from home and join the Forest Watchers to find some peace. Mark my words.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Al-Haitham’s garden continues to grow, leaf by leaf. Al-Haitham somewhat figures out trees. The lemon tree decides that it will not be dying after all. The mint plant decides it would rather<em> everything else</em> die in its bid to take over not just its own already comically large pot but also the entire shelf of pots it’s been placed on. If Al-Haitham had known that saving Kaveh’s mint plant all of those months ago would have led to this, he might have reconsidered putting so much effort into it. Maybe Kaveh was onto something when he only gave the plants a modicum of attention.</p><p>Al-Haitham’s fruit trees have at least a year or two before he can begin inflicting their small terrors upon others. And his vegetables are mostly done for the year, or at least, until Sumeru’s generous climate coaxes them into an extra round of production. It is now Al-Haitham and his flowers and the herbs, and the succulents.  He has been considering if it was worth the trouble to put in a bird feeder — seed for the sparrows and finches, or perhaps dyed sugar for the hummingbirds. He’s not sure where he would hang it from. If it’s the sugar, he does not want it exposed to the sunlight for fear it would spoil. A seed feeder seems like too much mess, though.</p><p>In the quiet mornings and the not-so-quiet evenings, Al-Haitham has taken to spending a few minutes standing in the garden, not doing anything or looking for something to do, but just standing there to stand there. He stands there and he permits himself to feel the place as it is — not as the river of dendro at the back of his mind — but as smells, as sounds, as colors, as textures. </p><p>How strange it is, to think back on what this was and see how far it has come since then. So many things can change in just a few months, a year. He shouldn’t be surprised by that. But he is. Perhaps it is because he spent so much of his life walking over a slow wave of change, one gradual thing at a time. And then suddenly he was at the forefront of so many changes, so many new things and new people, grappling with the creation of so many new groups, new procedures, new laws, new ideas.</p><p>Just a little under a year ago, this space was empty stone, dusty with weeds growing through the cracks. And here it is now. Here it is. Al-Haitham wishes he had the foresight to take a picture before he began. But not even he could have predicted that the garden would grow and flourish like so. How could he? What evidence or hint would have clued him in to anticipating something such as this sprouting from the faintest wisps of an idea? Al-Haitham had not even thought about growing something beyond parsley. How would the Al-Haitham of a year ago even conceived of — <em>this</em>?</p><p>Almost a full year ago, when Al-Haitham first started this as an experiment, Kaveh had asked him if this makes him happy. Al-Haitham, then, at the very beginning of things, could not answer him.</p><p>But Al-Haitham has the answer before him now.<em> Yes. </em>It’s a <em>yes. </em>Yes<em>. Yes.</em></p><p>Al-Haitham may have started this garden with questions on effect and efficacy, on capability and capacity, but those answers ceased to be important months ago. Al-Haitham has persisted, he has continued to feed into this, because it pleases him to do so. Is that not what he does? He does what pleases him. If Al-Haitham wants something, he finds a way to get it. If Al-Haitham likes something, he repeats it. In this, Al-Haitham thinks he is the simplest person in all of Sumeru, perhaps Teyvat.</p><p>The morning of Kaveh’s departure, Al-Haitham wakes and walks towards the garden for his morning check of the plants. And he is surprised to find that Kaveh is there, it looks like he might have been there for a while.</p><p>Kaveh stands with his back towards Al-Haitham, in the middle of the garden. The image of him there reminds Al-Haitham of something, some familiar scene to this one. Although he can’t quite remember it.</p><p>“Kaveh.” Al-Haitham steps into the cool morning air, immediately turning to start his morning routine of checking the plants. The miniature olive tree, in particular, has been causing him some trouble, and there have been insects taking over the hoya’s vines.</p><p>It is not unusual to see Kaveh in the garden. Kaveh comes out to smoke on the rare occasions he needs to. Sometimes, when he is cooking, he comes out to pick vegetables or herbs. Kaveh’s told him about various observations now and again — <em>Your harra fruits look like they’re getting overripe soon. The green onions look like they’re doing very well. The snail in your pond is being bullied by the fish. I saw a cat out there, underneath the jasmine, looking quite cantankerous, have you seen it?</em></p><p>So it is not unusual for Kaveh to be here. Kaveh’s helped him move things around, he’s built several of the shelves and the racks and the trellises. This is not Kaveh’s first time seeing the garden as it is. But there is something strange about seeing Kaveh here this early, when the morning is still very quiet. There is something strange about the way Kaveh stands, hands folded behind his back. It’s that Kaveh is still, Al-Haitham thinks. It is because Kaveh is being very still and very quiet. Kaveh can be one or the other, but he very rarely both at the same time.</p><p>Al-Haitham wonders if Kaveh slept last night. Kaveh travels poorly. He doesn’t sleep well in strange places. He’s going to be miserable by the time they reach Fontaine.</p><p>As Al-Haitham is testing the soil of basil — something is eating the leaves and he still cannot figure out what — Kaveh speaks.</p><p>“Before you get on me about it, I <em>did</em> sleep last night. I slept quite well, actually. But I suppose I must be even more nervous than I thought, because I woke up early like I was going to the Akademiya,” Kaveh begins, words slow and careful. “And I was lying there in bed tossing and turning and trying to fall asleep, but you know how it is once you’re awake. And normally I would work on something, but everything’s been packed up and away. So there I was just lying in bed with all of my luggage around me, staring at the ceiling feeling like a little kid. And then…I heard the water.”</p><p>Kaveh’s head turns towards the pond near his window, his voice softening and turning onto something wondrous, something luminous.</p><p>“I heard the water through the window. I heard the birds. And then I found myself out here, looking. Just looking.” Kaveh’s voice wavers. “I had heard it all before, of course. I’ve heard the water, I’ve heard the birds, I have heard the crickets and I have heard the buzz of the bees, I have heard that ugly cat acting like it owns the place whenever we’re not immediately present to remind it otherwise. And I have seen it, your garden, Al-Haitham. I know I have. I’ve seen it in all of its stages. But Al-Haitham. I don’t know how I didn’t realize it — maybe it’s because I’m going to be leaving it in a few short hours — but I came out here this morning and I looked at it and I listened to it and I realized…it is brilliant, Al-Haitham. <em>You</em> are brilliant.”</p><p>Al-Haitham’s hand drops from the basil leaf, confusion rising in him as Kaveh turns onto him that soft look, that glowing look, that wound of a look.</p><p>“Al-Haitham,” Kaveh says, red eyes gleaming, “You did so well.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“I’m proud of you.”</p><p>“Oh.” Al-Haitham blinks, the surprise taking him by surprise.</p><p><em>I’m proud of you,</em> Kaveh’s voice loops in his head. <em>I’m proud of you</em>. Al-Haitham doesn’t know why the words have caught him so off guard. </p><p>Perhaps it is because people don’t really say those sort of things to <em>him</em>. Why would they? Al-Haitham does not care for other’s opinions of him. And when people are telling him their opinions, it’s usually going the other way to point out his flaws or places where they think he ought to improve. Al-Haitham only ever listens to that if he finds that their statements have accurate evidence behind them and if he finds a benefit in listening to their advice — that is to say, <em>rarely</em>. Although <em>not</em> never. Al-Haitham is fully aware that he is not the most approachable person in most situations, and it’s very rare indeed when someone feels bold enough to come up to him with honest critique. </p><p>In any case, most people who speak on him in such a way do so out of frustration or anger. And when people speak from a place of hurt, from a place of anger with the intent to hurt back, Al-Haitham doesn’t bother to listen at all.</p><p>As nature loves a void, is it not true that rules love their exceptions?</p><p>And is Kaveh not Al-Haitham’s prime example of an exception? Even when Kaveh speaks in anger Al-Haitham listens. He does not usually agree or find merit in Kaveh’s criticisms, but he <em>does</em> listen. </p><p>Kaveh’s opinion, to Al-Haitham, matters. He has always held Kaveh in high regard. Is that why it takes him by surprise? Kaveh’s compliments are rare when it comes to Al-Haitham, and they almost always get appended or prefaced with something sharp as though he has to weigh out the good with something bad. For Kaveh to give him this form of honesty like so is unusual. Unheard of. Al-Haitham does not think Kaveh has ever spoken to him like so, not even when they were young men in the Akademiya. </p><p>Still -</p><p>“I don’t need you to be.”</p><p>Kaveh’s lips twitch up into a momentary grin, eyes fond as he shakes his head. “I know. I know you don’t. You don’t need anything from me. And most of the time, I don’t need things from you. But it is because it is you. It is because it is me. Isn’t it? It’s because it’s us that we do it anyway. That’s just how we’ve been, you and me, Al-Haitham and Kaveh. Just because we don’t <em>need</em> things from each other doesn’t mean that we don’t <em>give</em> them all the same. Just because we do not ask for, does not mean we cannot be offered it. And I wanted you to know, before I left. It felt important for you to know. For me to know that I said it to you at least once, even if it doesn’t mean anything for you at all.”</p><p>Before Al-Haitham can respond to that Kaveh looks around them, gesturing at the garden.</p><p>“Al-Haitham, before I go — I want to ask. Why did you do this? The experiment — what was the question you were asking? The hypothesis you were testing? You never told me. Or is it still ongoing?”</p><p>“It is not.” Al-Haitham pinches a leaf of the hoya between his fingertips, feeling around the rough and pitted edge where something has been biting and gnawing on the plant. “Do you remember the evening with the plums?”</p><p>Kaveh’s brow furrows, lips parting with the familiar sharp inhale that usually precedes him snapping something about Al-Haitham being evasive or obtuse or any number of unsavory things in the name of not answering a question. </p><p>A year ago, this garden did not exist. A year ago, Kaveh was not moving to Fontaine. A year ago, they did not stand together in the fragile mornings and speak of things like pride, of offerings. </p><p>Kaveh cuts himself off, eyes narrowing and flicking off to the side as he thinks over Al-Haitham’s question, mouth silently shaping the word, “<em>Plums</em>?” </p><p>Al-Haitham waits. Kaveh will remember. Kaveh has an unfortunately sharp memory for extremely useless things.</p><p>“Oh. The plums.” Kaveh blinks, recognition rising like the sun that continues to creep its way into the sky above them. His brow remains furrowed. Kaveh’s head, suddenly, snaps to the side, towards the mint. The aloe. The green onion. And then, like someone who was just startled awake, Kaveh gives a full body jerk and his head whips around as he takes in the garden courtyard again with new context.</p><p>“The soil, the cutting, the planting, the cleaning, helped,” Al-Haitham tells him. “I am not sure <em>why</em> it helped other than perhaps it was an acceptable sort of new and tactile touch, something that required some of my attention but not all of it. Perhaps it was because it required me to use familiar motions on unfamiliar subjects and it was intriguing, new, enough that it became tolerable. But it worked. I wanted to see if I could repeat it, and if so, would it yield a similar calming result? The answer is yes.”</p><p>Kaveh’s eyes move over pots, over wooden frames, over stem and stalk as he nods slowly. “Yes. You do have a tendency to come out here when you’re a little…<em>much</em>, I noticed. Although I was not sure if you did. It makes sense. Would you think poorly of me if I said I’m a little relieved you’re turning to this garden more than the stress baking? There’s really only so much you can bake at a time. That’s why it’s so funny when you complain about people giving us so much food, you know.”</p><p>“I don’t see you laughing.”</p><p>“Well no, because I end up having to eat it with you.” Kaveh’s nose wrinkles. “Alright, maybe funny isn’t the right word. So you started this garden to see if the action of gardening was something you could substitute in for baking or writing or reading when you get…the way you sometimes get.”</p><p>“Useless? Yes.”</p><p>Kaveh makes a sharp noise of protest that Al-Haitham waves away.</p><p>“That was part of it. The easier part of it to test,” Al-Haitham continues, curling a bit of a pothos’ yellow-green vine around his fingertip. The other part of the test is one that sits closer to the heart for him, one more personal in nature. Even more personal. He has a feeling that both Tighnari and Nahida had somehow gleaned that this was the secondary question that was actually (for greater part of the experiment when the garden was still an experiment) the primary question. Al-Haitham considers telling Kaveh of it now. </p><p>Kaveh would probably be able to guess given enough time just by the fact that he is who he is. And Al-Haitham should probably tell it to Kaveh using his own words, or else Kaveh might accidentally misconstrue it. Al-Haitham and Kaveh have an odd way of seeing the exact same thing, coming to the exact same conclusion, but walking away with entirely different ways of understanding the same conclusion.</p><p>“I was curious if I was capable of it.” And then, to make sure that Kaveh doesn’t get the wrong idea, he makes sure to clarify: “Care. Caring.”</p><p>Al-Haitham’s eyes travel over every shade of green, splatters of brown and white and yellow. The walls of the house are barely visible. Tendrils of vines and leaves have begun to creep up the eaves, getting handholds on the edges of the roof. The windows are the only things left clear, and even then the aggressive expansion of Nahida’s mystery plant, the jasmine, and the rose all vying for upward space infringes upon the glass. He’ll have to cut them again soon.</p><p>“I was curious to see if someone like me was capable of producing anything, of caring for something in a way that matters from start to finish,” Al-Haitham elaborates, moving to check on the aggrieved bitter gourd and then takes up the small little spray bottle to mist at some of the orchids that he’s been attempting to grow. There’s a small stag horn that’s just begun to look like it wants to survive behind them that he makes sure to avoid hitting too much. “I wondered if it was a literal matter of nurture versus nature. Could I cultivate, within myself, the ability to care and tend for something, or was it a non-starter? With effort, adequate supplies, and repeated trial and error, would I be able to overcome my own natural disinclination? Or is it something innately defunct within me that would require further external assistance? Is the ability to care and grow, cultivate, something innate that everyone has and simply requires refinement and practice over time, or is it something inborn? With neglect, is this a facet of the self that can atrophy and be permanently lost, or is it something that remains within a person always?”</p><p>As Al-Haitham speaks he is aware of Kaveh being very still and unusually quiet. Also, the man is turning quite red in the face. As Al-Haitham is misting the flowers Kaveh starts to sputter like a kettle.</p><p>“What are you talking about?”</p><p>“You know fully well what I am talking about.” Al-Haitham frowns, turning towards Kaveh. Kaveh’s face is splotchy, ugly red, and his hands are at fists at his sides. His shoulder are shaking. Al-Haitham doesn’t understand where this sudden anger has come from. And because Al-Haitham does not understand it, he cannot attempt to fix or appease it. But Al-Haitham does not want Kaveh to leave Sumeru, leave him, furious. He must try.</p><p>Then again, here is simple and timely proof of Al-Haitham’s question and answer.</p><p>“See?” Al-Haitham points out.</p><p>“See <em>what</em>? What are you talking about?”</p><p>“My ability to care, to tend, has always been poor. Look at us right now. You’re angry and I can’t even begin to guess why. Even after all of these years in proximity to you, I still make missteps when it comes to you. I am not naturally inclined towards being soft towards others. I am not particularly good at caring for things.”</p><p>Kaveh stares at him, expression blank before he explodes. “You keep <em>saying</em> that! <em>What</em> are you talking about? <em>Of course you care!</em> Of course you’re <em>capable</em> of care! <em>Good</em> at caring for things? Are you listening to yourself? What’s gotten into you? Since when were you so insecure and — and lacking in self-awareness?”</p><p>“Well, yes. I know I’m capable of it <em>now</em>. Afterwards. After this.” Al-Haitham waves his hand around himself. “I have developed the ability as I have developed my muscles, my language skills. <em>Now</em> I am capable because I have worked to be and practiced over time: a matter of nurture and nature, capability and capacity. That was my question and now I have my answer. I was not sure <em>before</em>, but now I am. I <em>am</em> capable of it. It <em>is</em> within my capacity. As you pointed out, in order to work at problem one must first address and identify it. I had to first acknowledge that it was not part of my natural aptitude, in comparison to most, and especially you — “</p><p>Kaveh snaps into motion, crossing the small space between them. He grows larger as he does. Practically speaking this is a matter of perspective. Things at a distance are smaller. Things that are closer are large. But Kaveh has a way of expanding beyond the boundaries of his own skin, his bones, his shadow, his voice. Kaveh can fill an atrium with his exuberance; he can cover a field with his weariness; he can smother a garden with his outrage.</p><p>Kaveh seizes Al-Haitham by the shoulders, sharply and suddenly shaking him into alarmed silence. Al-Haitham’s own hands fly up, dropping the mister, as he tries to grasp Kaveh’s wrists. But Kaveh just shakes him harder.</p><p>“<em>Why</em> do you keep saying that? Compared to? Compared to <em>who</em>? Since when did you compare yourself to others? Since when did you compare yourself to <em>me</em>?”</p><p>No man is an island. In less figurative terms that would cut to one of the meanings of the idiom: progress comes from comparison. This is a simple fact that Al-Haitham should not have to remind Kaveh of. An outside reference is always needed in order to confirm the original baseline reading, and to establish standards for evaluating development over time and final conclusions. In order to mark any change or difference, there must be a comparison made. So why is Kaveh acting so offended, so insulted, now?</p><p>“Who does not compare me to you?”</p><p>Kaveh goes still as if struck. Al-Haitham’s head spins with the sudden stop in motion and he blinks rapidly as he tries to reorient himself in the small reprieve Kaveh’s shock has given them both.</p><p>“And what’s so bad about that? <em>You</em> compare yourself to me, don’t you?” Al-Haitham points out unnecessarily. Kaveh has admitted it himself, time and time again. Sometimes he says it with reverence, with respect. Sometimes with resentment. They are each other’s challenges, for better or for worse.</p><p>“But…<em>but</em> —“</p><p>“Who <em>else</em> would I want to compare myself to in this specific field?” Al-Haitham continues, trying to pull Kaveh’s hands off of his shoulder. But Kaveh’s fingers have curled in, no doubt stretching and wrinkling the fabric. “Are you not the most affectionate and loyal there is? Why bother comparing myself to the mediocre when what I want to know is how I compare to the best? In any case, it was not really a <em>direct</em> comparison that I was holding in the forefront of my mind as I went through this. It was just an idle thought that would sometimes come up while I was thinking about the garden. The point is that I wanted to <em>know</em> what I was capable of — <em>if</em> I was capable at all.”</p><p>“<em>Oh</em>,” Kaveh says, sounding a little stupid. And then, entire body flooding with some mixture of emotions Al-Haitham does not have the energy to try and identify, Kaveh shakes him again, gently this time. “<em>Oh</em>.” And then Kaveh’s hands leave Al-Haitham’s shoulders for his neck, his face, his hair. Kaveh’s hands flutter over his skin, unable to settle as Kaveh’s red eyes gleam, looking right into him for some kind of answer to a question Al-Haitham has not yet glimpsed. “<em>Haitham</em>,” he whispers, voice cracking, “Haitham, <em>of course you’re capable.</em> Of course you are. Who told you otherwise?”</p><p>“Have you not said it yourself often enough? <em>‘Of course you can’t see it’</em>. Have not you and most others who know of this venture of mine not expressed the shock at it? I don’t care about rumors or gossip, Kaveh, but I am not deaf to it. I know how people think of me. I know how my words and actions are perceived by others. It’s simply that I normally don’t pay any mind to it. What other people feel about me is their problem, not mine. But I do know that I am lacking in compassion, in softness. I know I am considered selfish, egotistical, self-absorbed, and individualistic. These are some of my stronger qualities. I was simply curious to see if I had any ability to be anything else.”</p><p>Kaveh’s face, as Al-Haitham talks, crumples. His fingers shake as they press flat against Al-Haitham’s skin on the sides of his face, his neck, into his hair. Al-Haitham raises his hands to hold Kaveh’s shaking arms, unsure of how to soothe, to satisfy, when he doesn’t know what the problem is in the first place.</p><p>But Al-Haitham knows the shape of the shining thing in Kaveh’s eyes, the dark twist of his mouth, even if he is not sure why it is present. Al-Haitham moves a hand to cover Kaveh’s mouth before he can say something ridiculous.</p><p>“I don’t want an apology from you,” Al-Haitham says. “What would I do with it? What is there to apologize for? To feel guilty or shame about? And what would it have to do with <em>you</em>? I’m happy. My questions were answered, the answers are much better than I anticipated they would be, and I find the garden satisfying even when it is not acting as my testing ground for questions of philosophy or physiology. Besides. Since when did I ever do anything just because of you? If I, myself, were not invested, curious, in the topic on my own I never would have invested so much time and effort into this. I will not deny that some of the things you’ve mentioned made me curious, but it is not about <em>you</em>. Do not take credit that isn’t yours. And even if it <em>was</em> about you —<em> it isn’t,</em> stop looking at me like that — then it would have only been in the very beginning.”</p><p>Al-Haitham drops his hand and waves out around them. “This garden has escaped the boundaries of an experiment. It did so months ago. I am not doing this to answer questions anymore. I am continuing with the growth and development of this space because I want to. It pleases me to do so, so I will. Do not tell me you’re displeased that I have a <em>hobby</em>.”</p><p>“No, of course not. It’s just — the questions that caused you to do this in the first place — <em>It’s</em> — you should <em>never</em> have thought that it was a <em>question</em> in the first place,” Kaveh says, sounding miserable. “<em>How</em> could you have even thought that? That you weren’t capable of the care?”</p><p>“Kaveh, you are not the only person in Sumeru to think of me as uncaring. <em>I told you.</em> I <em>know</em> how people think of me. It isn’t an insult to me. It’s true — just like the color of my eyes or hair.” Al-Haitham shrugs. “I am not affectionate. I am not nurturing. I am not good at being soft. I believe one of the more lighthearted assessments I once received was ‘<em>doesn’t interact well with others’</em>. I have, clearly, learned, but it is not something that comes to me naturally. For me, at least, it seems to require much more effort than it does the rest of you. And most of the time I simply don’t see the point in it.”</p><p>To Al-Haitham’s horror, Kaveh’s eyes start to glimmer, welling up. Kaveh’s hands tremble, still pressed flat against Al-Haitham’s face, thumbs shakily touching against the outer edge of Al-Haitham’s brows, his temples.</p><p>“Al-Haitham.” Kaveh’s voice shakes as much as his hands do. “I think you really are going to break my heart for good one day. I meant of course <em>you</em> couldn’t see it.”</p><p>“<em>Yes</em>. We established this. I <em>know</em>. I cannot see it. I <em>still</em> don’t. Although, sometimes, I catch glimpses of it. The garden helped, but caring for plants is vastly different than being able to care for other people.”</p><p>Kaveh shakes his head.</p><p>“No. <em>No</em>. That’s not what I meant — I mean. You can’t see it because it is <em>inside</em> of you. You cannot see the power you, yourself, have. Researcher’s bias. Al-Haitham — you cannot see the effect you have, the magnitude of your very self upon the world because you, yourself, are biased by <em>being</em> the effect. Of course you can’t see your potential and your effect when you choose to act upon it. Your own power as a potentiator. You are within it, Al-Haitham. You are inside of it. A cause is fundamentally incapable of lingering to witness its own effect due to its nature as the catalyst, the precursor. Present action is unable to see beyond itself into the future it creates because it is always within itself, within the act of transformation and transition. It becomes an issue of tense: past, present, future<em>. Do you understand?”</em></p><p>Al-Haitham’s hands close around Kaveh’s wrists. Kaveh is no longer shaking. Not his hands, not his voice. Al-Haitham, now, is the one on entirely unsteady ground — unfamiliar territory. What are they talking about? Al-Haitham doesn’t know. It is Kaveh who has found himself to solid footing while Al-Haitham feels himself losing his own. It feels like they are talking about separate topics, but are somehow including just enough cross over that they are able to continue. How do they come to this point? Where does it come from?</p><p>Al-Haitham thought they were talking about the experimental findings of his garden. This should not be an <em>emotional</em> topic. Al-Haitham wants to say that’s Kaveh’s doing — Kaveh brings his exposed heart to every fight and is still somehow surprised to find it injured — but it takes two to hold a discussion, so Al-Haitham must have done something to bring them here.</p><p>"Al-Haitham. Did you know that every time I look at you, you have changed? You change and yet you are somehow still you, still Al-Haitham. I am constantly in awe of it, of you. All of your changing, all of your growing and adapting, all of your causes and effects — you don’t see it. That’s what I mean when I say — when <em>we</em> say — that you wouldn’t understand, that you wouldn’t see. In reaction to you and the way you change, the rest of us change too. Do you know that? Do you understand that? You must. You’re so observant. Although I’m sure that the conclusions you’ve drawn are vastly different from the ones the rest of us have come to consensus on. To you it’s absolutely nothing at all — nothing to do with you, no big deal, nothing to speak or even think on. But to me that is one of the most beautiful, most awe-inspiring things of all. <em>All of you</em>. All of that excellence.”</p><p>Kaveh steps in so close. Al-Haitham cannot pull away.</p><p>“You <em>care</em>. You care so <em>deeply</em>. About people. About those around you. I have known it. I have <em>always</em> known it. Al-Haitham, there is a love in you that leaves me floored every time I catch so much as a glimpse of it. The ways you express this care, this love, are not the ways bards will sing of or poets will eulogize. But they are so <em>powerful</em>. You do not see it, but the rest of us do. We know it. We have known it.”</p><p>Al-Haitham shakes his head but Kaveh holds him still. Kaveh pauses, breath hitching slightly. </p><p>“Even if we were to discard the rest, even if we cut out everyone else from the equation — there’s me. <em>You</em> <em>know</em> what you have done for me, Al-Haitham.<em> I</em> <em>know</em> what you have done for me.”</p><p>Their faces, now, are so close. What happens next is not a kiss. Their mouths do not quite meet. It is more that Kaveh presses their faces close together, so that they are sharing the patterns of their breaths, the corners of their mouths touching, the sides of their cheeks and jaws and brows pressing together. Al-Haitham closes his eyes. It is too much. <em>They are too much.</em> Kaveh smells sweet — he smells of green things. He smells of rosewater and he smells of morning sun, a warmth that lingers with the weight of humidity and the faintest edge of actual heat. Kaveh smells of freshly ironed clothing. He smells of the light. </p><p>“That you cannot see it, that you cannot understand it of yourself, aggrieves me. But there are some things that cannot be explained, shown, to you by others. And I must settle with knowing it for you, until you are able to know it for yourself.”</p><p>Kaveh’s face turns into his and he whispers into Al-Haitham’s unprotected ear —</p><p>“So when I return, will you show me what you have done next? Will you show me what new form of excellence you have taken when I was not looking? I want to see it, Al-Haitham. I want to see it. I want to see you. Would you let me?”</p><p>Al-Haitham’s arms, without much of Al-Haitham’s own conscious thought, slide around Kaveh as he presses his cheek against Kaveh’s, holding him close. Al-Haitham can feel the fast pound of Kaveh’s heart, and stutter of his breath as their arms circle each other, holding on tight. He is sure that his own heart is going just as hard, his own breathing just as fast.</p><p>“Do what you want, Kaveh. Who stops you? What stops you? If you want to do something then do it. If you want to see it, then look upon it. If you want to see me, then come find me. It will be here. I will be here. When you return, let us remember the flowers together.”</p>

<p>Time moves inexorably onwards, apathetic and ambivalent to how it is passed, wasted, spent, marked, and measured. </p><p>Kaveh, taking a page out of Nilou’s book, begins to write to them as soon as he settles in Fontaine — sending them each letters in cycles, although slightly more irregular. He writes to someone when he has time, and trusts that whoever he wrote to will pass on the message to everyone else in their tapestry of busybodies. Al-Haitham has to respect the efficiency. Kaveh’s letters are several pages, double sided, in length; some are written over the course of multiple sessions based on the color of the ink and the sudden shifts in tone. Al-Haitham wouldn’t care to write out the same contents in similar letters more than once, either.</p><p>The first of them to get a letter is, unsurprisingly, Senior Faruzan who would have no doubt been incredibly peeved if the respects due to her were not given.

Besides, what business is it of anyone? Al-Haitham and Kaveh are, as always, unique onto themselves.</p><p>In Al-Haitham’s letter, Kaveh writes of his mother, of her new husband. He writes of going to their house for the first time and how strange it felt, of wanting to run, but forcing himself to dig his heels in to stay. Kaveh writes, at the very end, <em>I am not quite sure if being brave is all that it’s made out to be, Al-Haitham. But you would tell me that there is nothing beautiful or pleasant about being brave, wouldn’t you? They have a small little garden, smaller than yours even, here. Do me a favor, won’t you? Send me something from yours, something from Sumeru? </em></p><p>Enclosed was a dried sprig of lavender that made him sneeze, and when Al-Haitham held the pages up to his nose he could smell it and a trace of something that must have been Kaveh’s cologne. He ran his fingers over Kaveh’s salutation at the end — <em>Regards</em> —and went to the tea canister by the door where he keeps all his extra seeds. </p><p>He wrote back, briefly,<em> If you know what I am going to tell you, then you do not need me to write it down for you, do you? </em></p><p>Enclosed with the letter were carefully packaged bulbs of the Mourning Flower, which he had asked Dehya to get for him and had been saving for when the weather was a little bit drier, and the seeds of the Sumeru Rose gathered from the ones in his own garden.</p><p>Much to Al-Haitham’s surprise and annoyance, Kaveh has even written a few of their neighbors. He is entirely sure that this was because they threatened him before he left. Nour Aunt calls Al-Haitham over to read Kaveh’s letter for her. He sits on the floor of her living room as she squints at her embroidery hoop, reading out Kaveh’s assurance that he is being treated well, is not having trouble with the food, is eating properly, and has not been robbed or swindled by anyone.</p><p>“<em>Yet</em>,” Nour Aunt grumbles. “Tell your Kaveh to write larger next time.”</p><p>Kaveh’s writing, in Nour Aunt’s letter, is already twice its normal size. In the post script Kaveh writes directly to Al-Haitham (knowing that Nour Aunt would call upon him to read it for her) to remind him to give it another go at convincing Nour Aunt to wear her spectacles.</p><p>When someone asks Al-Haitham to read or write for them, he does exactly so without editing or filter. So he reads this part out to Nour Aunt and she gets so annoyed that she stabs her needle into the side of her embroidery project and commands Al-Haitham to get a pen and paper right now so she can reply while the thoughts are still fresh in the mind.</p><p>Al-Haitham’s hand cramps with how fast he has to write to keep up with Nour Aunt’s dictation, which is incredibly impressive because normally he’s able to handle transcribing arguments between four people at once. Al-Haitham is shaking out his hand and rubbing his wrist as Nour shepherds him out the door and down the street towards Sarath Uncle’s house where he’s sat down to eat dinner while Nour and Sarath and the rest of Sarath’s family come in to chatter about Kaveh and Nour Aunt’s continued distaste for spectacles and how they’re all entirely certain that there must be someone on the street who’s feeding and taming the dusk birds because now the things keep hanging around like they’re waiting for something.</p><p>Nilou has decided that the dance she had worked on while in Liyue is ready for the stage. Dehya asks him to go with Lady Dunyarzad on the opening night. Dehya would go herself, but Candace also wants to see the dance and then talk to Nilou about the sword arts she learned in Liyue, but Candace is unable to leave Aaru Village for another few weeks. Dehya wants to wait to see it with Candace so it’s new for the both of them.</p><p>Al-Haitham goes with Lady Dunyarzad and Cyno. He is not versed enough in Liyue Opera, Liyue sword styles, Sumeru sword dance, or how any of those should come together to make any form of helpful statement. But Al-Haitham knows how much work Nilou put into it and he makes sure to watch the precise positioning of her hands, the calculated twists of her limbs that causes the specially tailored fabric of her newly tailored clothes to flare and twist that he remembers her working on and examining from multiple angles in the mirror over and over again to get just right.</p><p>When the show is over, Al-Haitham follows Cyno and Lady Dunyarzad backstage, letting the two of them break the way through the crowds. Between Lady Dunyarzad’s general air of genteel nobility and Cyno’s reputation (even when off duty) the path clears to Nilou’s dressing room and the three of them slip inside easily. Nilou’s face glows with exertion and joy. Al-Haitham has had his sound cancelling on since her performance ended and he keeps it on as he makes himself comfortable against the wall, waiting for the other three to finish their talking.</p><p>Cyno must offer to escort Lady Dunyarzad back because the two of them leave, Cyno nodding at Al-Haitham and Lady Dunyarzad offering him a small smile. Nilou is sitting in front of her dressing table, waiting for him. He slides his sound cancelling down, moving forward to hand her the simple arrangement of roses he had cut from his garden. </p><p>The roses are pale pink, but large and ruffled, with the centers of their blooms a darker, almost violent shade of pink compared to the outer petals that have faded to an almost white.</p><p>“Careful,” Al-Haitham says, holding the simple arrangement back from her when she reaches for them. “There are only a few thorns, but they are sharp.”</p><p>Nilou pauses, hand outstretched before he passes the flowers off to her. She smiles, bringing them up to her face and breathing them in. Of the roses that Al-Haitham has successfully grown thus far, he finds that this variant lasts the longest in bloom and scent. The smell is not overpowering, but it is noticeable and rather pleasant. </p><p>“You know, usually when people cut roses to give they trim the thorns off before giving the gift.”</p><p>Al-Haitham frowns. “Why would I do that?” What a hassle. It’s not that hard to avoid being pricked by the thorns. “The roses grew them for a reason. They are part of the flower. If you don’t want the thorns, then there are thornless variants or, better yet, flowers that do not have the thorns at all.”</p><p>Nilou’s smile spreads wider, turning into a grin that causes her eyes to curve. She holds the stems of the roses loosely in her hands.</p><p>“And this is why I find it hard to believe when people call you cold,” she says. Al-Haitham’s frown deepens. What does <em>that</em> have to do with anything? “Thank you, Al-Haitham. I have a letter from Kaveh I just received earlier today. I haven’t opened it yet. Do you want to read it together?”</p><p>Kaveh writes about learning to cook from his mother and how the food in Fontaine is strange and also their dogs are strange and peculiarly groomed, usually just as tidy, if not better styled than the people. Kaveh writes that some of the dogs have jobs. He cannot tell if these jobs are more like mascots or if these are legitimate working dogs.</p><p>Separately, in a letter Al-Haitham reads while meat simmers on the stove and the spin crystal player croons out something soft and strangely thematically appropriate, his eyes read over the simple letters that Kaveh had sent him directly.</p><p><em>I do not remember how to be a son,</em> Kaveh writes on one page. And nothing else. Then, in a separate envelope that must have been mailed right after the first, Kaveh appends himself.<em> I am trying. I’ve always been a fabulous runner, but I’m starting to regret not brushing up on my swimming. I suppose it’s a good thing. I am trying. I am trying.</em></p><p>As Al-Haitham leans with his hip against the kitchen counter, glass of wine in one hand, the sound of the spin crystal singing in a dialect that belongs to an ancestry Al-Haitham has never met, but knows in faded memory tends a land that yields up figs and rice and cherries, Al-Haitham writes underneath Kaveh’s confession, <em>Who asked you? Who asks you to be anything other than you are? And who are they to make you yield?</em> He mails that back without bothering to sign and is utterly unsurprised when his next update comes through one of their friends instead of one of these more personal communications.</p><p>For reasons that Al-Haitham doesn’t care to think about, he is still — on the occasion — dragged in to voice his opinions during higher level meetings at the Akademiya. He has complained and pointed out how this is a flagrant violation of hierarchy and obvious bias, unbefitting of both the Archon and General Mahamatra, but his complaints have been thusly ignored every time. He’s considering filing a legitimate complaint but it would go to the Sages and the Sages, tragically, also want him in on these meetings. Apparently when Al-Haitham is present the meetings go much faster. </p><p>Either people talk faster in an attempt to try and get everything out before he can open his mouth and point out the obvious flaws in their plans, or people are too afraid to actually voice their thoughts knowing that he’d poke holes in them. In both cases, would it not make logical sense for those flawed plans not to be voiced at all? If they aren’t fit to be voiced before a simple scribe, <em>why</em> should they be suitable for the ears of the Sages, let alone the Archon or the General Mahamatra?</p><p>Al-Haitham is considering if he could hide in the archive long enough that they can’t stall the meeting while waiting for someone to find him when Nahida taps against the back of his mind in the shape of a question, a plea. And who is he to undermine the authority of their Archon after all that work he put into making sure she’d never be ignored again?</p><p>“This seems like an abuse of power,” Al-Haitham says when he arrives in the meeting room.</p><p>Cyno points him to a chair and promptly upends an entire bag of locks in front of him.</p><p>Al-Haitham stares at them, eyebrows raised. “And how do you expect me to take notes if I’m doing that?” And how desperate are they for him to be physically present that they’re now outright trying to entice him into staying with puzzles? Well. He is on the clock and if they want to waste time by having him sit in on a meeting he has no actual part to play in, solving puzzles and playing with locks the entire time then that’s how it will be. At least he’s getting paid. And no one can get annoyed with him when it’s the General Mahamatra himself that seems to have given unspoken permission for Al-Haitham to mess around during the meeting. </p><p>Nahida sets her chin on her hands and leans in, using a bit of her powers to nudge the pile of metal. Cyno sits next to Al-Haitham and gestures towards his second in command to begin opening statements to bring the meeting to order.</p><p>Al-Haitham makes himself comfortable and picks up the first padlock, turning it over in his hands. He recognizes the model. This one doesn’t even need a pick. Simple kinetic force will work just fine. He slams it down on the table, causing everyone in the room except for Nahida and Cyno to jump. The padlock swings open before the sound has finished echoing. Al-Haitham tosses the lock down the table towards Cyno, who simply puts it to his side and gestures for his second in command to keep talking.</p><p>Much to Al-Haitham’s disappointment, none of the locks prove to be much more of a challenge than that. He spends almost the entire meeting opening locks and tossing them at Cyno. </p><p>The Kshahrewar group presenting to the Sages is, for reasons he cannot understand, watching him like they’re either going to be sick over themselves or like they’re going to lunge across the table to throttle him. Frankly, if they did either, it would only contribute to this otherwise incredibly dull meeting. The Sages are doing an adequate job of keeping everything flowing along smoothly and Cyno is in his element, speaking with great authority and experience along with the rest of his support staff. Al-Haitham did not need to be here for this. And these locks are pathetic — hardly worth the effort. Dehya and Candace bring him better puzzles than these.</p><p>Al-Haitham is firmly convinced that he is somehow doing work for the Matra without being acknowledged or paid for it. At the end of the meeting (which had gone on long enough that he’d cleared every lock with time to spare to turn around and gesture the other two scribes present to pass him paper and pen so he could also work on his transcription of meeting notes, which he got almost entirely caught up on) Cyno reaches over to him before he can get up and leave to burrow himself in his archive again until clock out, lest he be besieged with requests for work.</p><p>“Lambad’s later,” Cyno says, tapping the table next to Al-Haitham’s elbow. “Collei just got a letter from Kaveh and sent it to me.”</p><p>That night after Nilou’s last performance of the evening, she arrives at Lambad’s with Dehya, Candace, and Lady Dunyarzad. Senior Faruzan had gone off with Layla for something or other. Some sort of research trip near the Wall of Samiel, but not quite across it. Perhaps on top of it, now that he thinks on it. Senior Faruzan had invited him to go, but at the thought of being stuck somewhere with Senior Faruzan and Layla at the same time without someone else to distract them from each other and himself made him feel inexplicably exhausted just thinking about it so he said no and that was that.</p><p>When Cyno arrives, he tosses Al-Haitham another set of locks as the rest of their group settles in to catch up. Much to Dehya’s amusement, Al-Haitham weighs the two locks in his hands before using the heavier one to strike the lighter one open. Dehya bursts out laughing when both locks swing open immediately. Al-Haitham frowns in distaste. He’d only meant to open the lighter lock. The heavier one should have at least required him to use a pick. He tosses them both back at Cyno, disappointed. It’s like the quality of locks Cyno has been giving him is <em>decreasing</em>. The first few times Cyno gave him locks they were actually challenging. Or at least, they required him to listen to the actual pins and tumblers inside.</p><p>“This is not even interesting anymore,” he says as he pulls out a book that Tighnari recommended to him on unique tree grafting practices from Inazuma. Tighnari wants to attempt the practice here in Sumeru and Al-Haitham is rather interested to see if the Inazuman practice can be used for some of Sumeru’s more temperamental cultivars that are already prone towards rapid-growth and mutations due to the increased dendro energy that permeates through the land. “The puzzles Dehya sends me are better than this.”</p><p>Cyno, to Dehya, says, “I had him do that in front of the new Kshahrewar governing body and the Sages during today’s security meeting. The meeting was two hours and he’d finished all of the locks in less than one.”</p><p>Al-Haitham frowns as the rest of the table laughs. </p><p>Dehya pauses in her laughter, turning to examine him with her sharp eyes, “What’s the scowl for?”</p><p>“That was a meeting on security?” Al-Haitham turns towards Cyno. “It was written into my schedule as a routine review of Kshahrewar budgeting and public works priorities.”</p><p>“The Kshahrewar are also partially in charge of security measures as masters of technology and construction,” Cyno reminds him.</p><p>“That is a topic of actual importance that I might have been interested in,” Al-Haitham says. “Why did you give me the locks then? Did you not want me to talk?” </p><p>Al-Haitham was paying enough attention to take notes, but the Kshahrewar representatives weren’t really saying much, and the main speakers for the meeting were Cyno’s Matra as they reported in on physical, manual, security flaws they had been steadily working on reviewing and updating now that the Akasha system was no longer functional to monitor or restrict people’s movements. Al-Haitham had reviewed some of those issues during his time as Acting Grand Sage, but he had mostly turned the matter over to the Matra as a matter of their renewed and strictly reinforced jurisdiction.</p><p>“Al-Haitham, Cyno brought you to a meeting on security measures and had you picking locks the entire meeting. Do you not see the reason why he might do something like that?”</p><p>“Picking would be a generous term for it, considering that for a majority of the locks all he had to do was give them a firm strike against another solid surface,” Cyno corrects dryly.</p><p>Candace’s mouth curves into a faint smile as she reaches over to inspect one of the locks Al-Haitham had just finished with. “Were these the Kshahrewar’s latest attempts at improved security that you were discussing at the meeting itself?”</p><p>Al-Haitham blinks, eyes turning towards the locks with renewed disappointment and distaste. <em>Surely not.</em></p><p>Cyno’s eyebrows raise at Al-Haitham, “Did you truly think I brought those locks to you at that specific meeting for no reason?”</p><p>Al-Haitham narrows his eyes. “I thought it was to keep me occupied so that I wouldn’t leave during the meeting. Or say something that would have the rest of the presenters reluctant to take the floor.”</p><p>“You did not seem very occupied, Al-Haitham.”</p><p>“I had hoped you had bought me actual <em>good</em> locks.”</p><p>“Apologies, but good locks seem to be thin on the ground,” Cyno says. And then, as if this would somehow make Al-Haitham feel any form of satisfaction, “I’ve temporarily permitted any lock that required you longer than thirty seconds and at least use of actual lock picking tools to be used for Sage rank clearance materials.” Before Al-Haitham can say what he thinks of <em>that</em>, Cyno pulls out Kaveh’s letter and hands it to him. “Read that while we order. Collei mentioned that he had a few more choice comments about the Kshahrewar’s current opinions on security. Kaveh was actually the one who suggested I bring you in for that when I asked him for advice on how to handle his contemporaries. They seemed to be of the belief that their security measures were adequate and refused to listen to either myself or the other Matra when we said otherwise. In his words: a picture is worth a thousand words. A demonstration is several thousand pictures. Al-Haitham is several thousand demonstrations in a single word.”</p><p><em>Meddler</em>, Al-Haitham thinks sourly as he flips through about twelve pages, front to back, of Kaveh’s neat writing detailing the goings on in Fontaine, how he’s been spending his off-hours, the food he’s eaten, the places he’s explored, so on and so forth. How does Kaveh have the time to meddle from an entire country away?</p><p>In a letter addressed to Al-Haitham directly, Kaveh writes of a fictional book he had picked up in Fontaine. It was very short, and Kaveh wasn’t particularly fond of any of the characters involved. In fact, Kaveh called the main protagonist an entitled narcissist with a penchant for the theatric. The two main supporting characters were paper-thin in terms of depth or realism and pretty clearly only exist to firstly, be mouthpieces for the author to shoehorn in some grand statements of that sounded much too grandiose and out of place for the text’s genre, and secondly to be quote, unquote, <em>mysterious</em>. The main protagonist’s love interest was wish-fulfillment wrapped in the shallow fantasy of romanticism.</p><p>And people have the audacity to say that<em> Al-Haitham</em> is a harsh critic.</p><p>But before Al-Haitham could wonder why Kaveh would waste so much time on writing about that, Kaveh finally got around to saying what he actually meant to be saying.</p><p><em>There is a portion shared here, through the mouth of the lover,</em> Kaveh wrote in brown-ish and slightly faded ink. And then he must have stopped and held the letter-writing off because the next sentence was written in dark blue. <em>That speaks of the practicalities and intricacies of written communication, and the dilation and warping of time, experience, and perception. In one moment, I am writing to you with my thoughts of you and wondering if you are thinking of me, not knowing when your hands will be the ones to touch the words I write. In another time, you are the one holding the page — and will I be thinking of you, then? When am I, when you read this letter? Are you the Al-Haitham I hold in my mind’s eye, as I remember you, that day I left you? Or are you some new Al-Haitham? Am I still the Kaveh that left you? </em></p><p>
<em>We are not the men who put their name to a shared thesis several years ago. But are we the men who met in a tavern and walked home together? Are we the men who shared that house for a few years?</em>
</p><p>
<em>But more importantly — are we still the men who stood shoulder to shoulder and held moonlight in their palms? </em>
</p><p>Kaveh does not answer his own question, signing off there rather abruptly. But Al-Haitham doesn’t mind. He tucks this letter away with the others and listens to Senior Faruzan cluck and titter over Kaveh’s letter to her explaining a clash of cultures during one of his joint-classes that’s giving him no small amount of grief.</p><p>(Al-Haitham is not sure if this is a reward, a punishment, or some third thing, but both he and Senior Faruzan have been granted paid leave to — simply put, do absolutely nothing at the Akademiya’s main campus while the Kshahrewar rapidly re-evaluate their works. Senior Faruzan is granted leave because if she’s around during a massive reshuffling of projects, priorities, and personnel there’s definitely going to be those disillusioned enough to go follow after her and her promises of greater knowledge in the Haravatat. Al-Haitham is nearly entirely certain that he’s being directed elsewhere because the Kshahrewar are definitely holding a grudge against him.</p><p>The new Haravatat sage, while handing them their leave budget, had deep bags under their eyes as they said, “This is why no one likes our Darshan.”</p><p>To which Senior Faruzan said, “Why wouldn’t anyone like our Darshan?”</p><p>And Al-Haitham said, “What does it matter if anyone likes our Darshan or not? Just don’t join then.”)</p><p>“As long as he doesn’t bow his head too far,” Senior Faruzan says, shaking her head with both arms up to the elbow in the guts of some machine made of various parts. Al-Haitham hands her some copper wires that she immediately begins to guide through the machine’s empty shell so that they can have some measure of what things are like inside. “Cooperation is all well and good in any venture, but what’s to be gained with being meek about it? And he’s there representing the Akademiya! Now’s the time for him to show off the Kshahrewar’s pride, if anything. What’s the point of all of our darshans having such bold mascots if we don’t at least act like them once in a while? Where’s the insulator? Not that one, the other one — you’re much better at this than most. Very well done. Are you sure you don’t want to apply to be my assistant?”</p><p>The machine, under her hands, suddenly jerks, momentarily sparking to life, before going inert once more.</p><p>“The hours,” Al-Haitham reminds her as they both carefully back away from the machine, “You put forward are miserable. But I am open to renegotiation.”</p><p>“It’s for <em>research</em> though. And they’re better hours than most other assistant positions. Also, my research is infinitely more interesting than whatever drivel they have you reviewing with a rubber stamp,” she sighs, using her Vision to send a little push of air at the machine. She elbows him lightly when the machine doesn’t move. Al-Haitham uses his Vision to give it a somewhat harder jab. The machine lights up with a flurry of harsh electric noise, jerking about before falling off the work table with a loud clang.</p><p>“You said that power channels were defunct and severed.”</p><p>“I think I made new ones,” she replies. They both walk over, Al-Haitham moving the machine back up onto the table as Senior Faruzan adjusts the magnifying loops to inspect the interior. The copper wire that Senior Faruzan had been working with appears to have inadvertently connected two glyphs that were inlayed along the interior of the machine near where the power core would have been. That shouldn’t matter though, because none of the parts they’re using were from recently functional machines, and the main core was decommissioned for at least a few months before Senior Faruzan got her hands on it. “Those runes aren’t supposed to work like that.”</p><p>Al-Haitham angles one of his dendro mirrors into the machine. “But they did. We need to find a book on metallurgy.”</p><p>Senior Faruzan lets out a disgruntled sigh. “No. Forget the books. We need to find a metallurgist. You can’t ask books questions.”</p><p>Unfortunately, they do not get very far into this new road of investigation and experimentation before they’re both quickly called back to the Akademiya and their postings — Al-Haitham’s as the scribe, Senior Faruzan’s as one of the senior members of the Haravatat’s active field research body.</p><p>“You two had <em>one</em> job,” the Haravatat Sage laments. “And it was stay out of trouble.”</p><p>“We did stay out of trouble,” Al-Haitham points out, but more importantly, he asks, “Do we get to keep the leftover budget?”</p><p>Senior Faruzan’s eyes light up and she claps him on the shoulder, nodding, “What my assistant said.”</p><p>The Haravatat Sage puts their head into their hands and laughs.</p><p>The answer is yes, and Senior Faruzan tucks a portion of that budget into his hand and gives him strict instructions to use it on something nice. Al-Haitham buys the most recent journals on ferrous material composition tolerances and applications, and some spare parts to see if he can recreate the experiment at home.</p><p>Al-Haitham finds that he makes excellent progress in whatever task or venture he has put his mind to when he works with the windows open. The sound of the pond and the birds is just as relaxing as all of the studies he’s read on background noise have claimed they would be. After much deliberation, he decided on trying out hummingbird feeders. By this, he means that one of the neighbors at the latest gathering decided to give him one of their old feeders because they got a new one and he did not get any say in this.</p><p>In one of Kaveh’s letters, this one sent to Tighnari, perhaps because Kaveh believes Tighnari capable of getting Al-Haitham to do something, Kaveh asks Tighnari to remind Al-Haitham to remind the rest of those living on the street that’s adopted their house as one of theirs that he’s just moved to Fontaine for a year. He isn’t dead. Tighnari does not tell Al-Haitham to do anything, but he does ask if Al-Haitham can bring Collei along for one of the gatherings.</p><p>Collei blanches, but apparently Kaveh’s paying more attention to the neighbors than Al-Haitham realized, because apparently there are at least five who are studying to enter the Amurta medicinal research branch and he thinks it would be good for Collei to interact with others in her same field, who are around her same age, who are not also Forest Watchers. Tighnari, apparently, agrees.</p><p>Al-Haitham turns to Collei and says, “You are a Forest Watcher. If it gets bad you can escape.” </p><p><em>Al-Haitham</em> cannot escape because he lives there and for reasons he does not care to try and understand, the entire street has the full confidence that they can walk up to him at any time and start talking at him. Al-Haitham has walked off in the middle of people talking to him but it doesn’t seem to deter them at all. They also don’t seem to care if he turns up his noise cancelling at them, which is a pleasant change of pace but also results in him sitting or standing around for at least an hour while he’s talked at and around. At this point he thinks that some of these people should get a pet. A stationary pet. Like a fish.</p><p>“Do…do you think I would <em>need</em> to escape?” Collei asks, eyes squinting in consideration.</p><p>“If you can handle Senior Faruzan you can handle this,” Tighnari points out, folding Kaveh’s letter and sliding it into one of his several hidden pockets. “Besides, they’ll be too busy hectoring Al-Haitham for news on Kaveh to really pay you any mind.”</p><p>Collei looks at Al-Haitham for confirmation and is so clearly relieved when he nods that he wonders if he should be at least a little annoyed by it. </p><p>“If you want to, then come,” Al-Haitham says. “If you don’t, then don’t.”</p><p>“I’ll go,” Collei says, squaring her shoulders, looking a lot like she’s signing up to walk into the middle of a battle. He supposes that it is not an inappropriate mindset to have.</p><p>Nour Aunt gives him a whole two days notice that he’s expected at her house, and informs him that she expects him earlier than everyone else to help. Her niece will be coming to help along with her newborn son. Her nephew will also be there, but Nour hasn’t any idea what for — “He can’t cook, he can’t eat properly, and he’s apparently not even doing so well in the Akademiya, so what’s he good for other than nonsense?”</p><p>“Why do I have to be there early?” Al-Haitham asks, neither confirming nor denying if he will be there at all, and idly wondering if he could plot an escape on that day or if the power of a neighborhood aunt’s disappointment can stretch all the way to the Dunes of Steel.</p><p>“Who else is going to be making the bread and helping with the rice?” Nour Aunt says, “And I have another letter from your Kaveh. Did you not tell him to write bigger? I still can’t read a single thing he says. His poor students!”</p><p>Two days later, Al-Haitham wakes up, tends his garden and opens his door to go to Nour Aunt’s house before she can drag him over. Perhaps if he starts early he can be dismissed early. When he opens the door, Collei is standing at his front step, hand hovering as if to knock. She stares up at him. And then, she holds up a letter with Kaveh’s writing on it. Meddler. Does he not have enough to do in Fontaine?</p><p>Al-Haitham resists the urge to roll his eyes. Instead he gestures her aside, locking his door and then heads to Nour Aunt’s house. The front door is unlocked. Al-Haitham would comment on that if he wasn’t entirely certain that the woman could make a burglar repent more than any run in with a member of the Corps of Thirty.</p><p>“You’re late,” Nour Aunt says, already halfway through creating mountains of diced vegetables in her small kitchen. She squints at Collei and says, “You’re thin.” And then to Al-Haitham, “Well, get to it. You know where everything is by now.”</p><p>Al-Haitham turns his sound cancelling up to maximum and, in her words, gets to it while Nour Aunt fusses over Collei and starts teaching her how to make kofta. Better her than Al-Haitham.</p><p>Collei is allowed to help for only so long as its just Al-Haitham and Nour. Once Nour Aunt’s niece and nephew, and her grand nephew arrive, Collei is set to watching the baby and the nephew, who apparently also needs the watching. Al-Haitham and Nour’s niece, Faridah, are assigned to keeping up with Nour Aunt as fast as they are able. Nour Aunt and Faridah occupy themselves with chatting at each other and leaving Al-Haitham alone except to tell him what to do next.</p><p>By the time people start arriving, every single portion of Nour Aunt’s kitchen is taken up with dishes being made, being cooked, waiting to be cooked, or just finished being cooked. Al-Haitham is set to peeling and cutting fruits as fast as he can. With any luck, Al-Haitham can get out of here just after noon.</p><p>When he’s given a break, Al-Haitham chances Nour’s small back yard to see if he can spot Collei. Collei is surrounded with children who are all interrogating her at speed. Collei does not seem to be bothered by this, and minding young children (in Al-Haitham’s limited experience) are a suitable deterrent from other people talking to you.</p><p>When he walks over to her, the baby in her arms immediately wriggles around to reach for him, almost falling out of Collei’s arms in the process. Al-Haitham takes the baby up, propping the child up on his hip and gestures for Collei to hold out her hands.</p><p>Collei does so and he drops his key into her hand. “If you need to go, then go,” he tells her, untangling the baby’s eager hand from his hair. </p><p>“What about you?” Collei asks, staring down at the key in her hands like it holds answers to incomprehensible questions of importance. It’s just a key.</p><p>“What about me?” </p><p>“If I have your key how will you get in?”</p><p>“The lock,” Al-Haitham says, “Is not very hard to get past.” And then. “Did your Master not teach you how to lock pick?” That seems like an oversight on Tighnari’s part.</p><p>“Um. I don’t think you’re supposed to pick your own lock.”</p><p>“Why? It’s very easy. And it’s my lock,” Al-Haitham points out, handing the baby off to Collei again because he can feel Nour Aunt or one of the several Aunts, Sisters, Uncles, or Brothers currently occupied in the kitchen about to put him to work. </p><p>Al-Haitham leaves just after early noon with too much food for one person to eat, somehow more than when he and Kaveh were both attending these gatherings, cuttings for a moringa plant he does not have room for, and an entire bag of dried and salted melon seeds.</p><p>Collei is nervously sitting in the front room when he returns. “Um. I didn’t know what I should do with the key? You have a letter from Master Kaveh.”</p><p>Al-Haitham sends Collei off with as much food as she can carry and a note to Tighnari asking him why his apprentice doesn’t know how to pick a lock, or seems so scandalized by the thought of using lock picking as a daily skill.</p><p>He reads Kaveh’s latest letter as he cracks seeds with his teeth, the pale white wash of salt on the exterior making his fingers and lips dusty. Kaveh writes about learning to cook from his mother.</p><p><em>Nothing</em>, Kaveh writes<em>, tastes the same. I don’t recognize anything. </em></p><p>Al-Haitham cannot tell if Kaveh is referring to the tastes or to something larger. It is most likely both. If Kaveh were here, he would say, <em>Why would you? You’ve never been to Fontaine for an extended amount of time before. </em></p><p>Kaveh continues, <em>I want to try cooking some of these for you. I can’t tell if you’d like it or hate it. I don’t know what I’d prefer. But I imagine some of these dishes could be much improved with some good Sumeru seasonings, and the fresh produce of your garden. Don’t things always taste better when they’re home grown? The bulbs you sent have begun to sprout and bloom. They’re beautiful. If you had kept them, where would you have found room for them in your garden? Tell me of the flowers that aren’t.</em></p><p>Al-Haitham isn’t sure, which is why he didn’t plant them. There’s hardly room for anything new anymore. Especially with how his older plants have decided to adopt an attitude. He is personifying plants, but he has no other way to say it. The jasmine and the climbing roses are inseparable in their war against some of the Hoya that have begun to climb in their direction. The miniature olive tree demands trimming and pruning every week on a schedule or else he faces a riot. The lemon tree has produced one single lemon and done so in such a recalcitrant manner that Al-Haitham almost thought to apologize for the inconvenience of expecting proof of life from the plant when clearly that was too much of a burden. The less that is said about the mint plant the better.</p><p>Meanwhile, Nahida’s mystery plant reveals itself to be a blackberry, Al-Haitham learns this when the shrub flowers, revealing five pedaled blooms of pale white-pink. He doesn’t tell anyone though. Dehya comes to sit in the garden with him on her way through Sumeru City headed south towards Port Ormos to meet with a new contact from Liyue.</p><p>“Branching out?” Al-Haitham asks her as she trails her finger through the surface of the water of the pond. The fish follow her finger, nibbling and biting. He is busy cutting stalks of mint, of fennel, of every single overgrown thing that somehow managed to get out of control in the three days he was gone to conduct a routine joint inspection of archival records at Caravan Ribaat with the Investigator. Al-Haitham tosses handfuls of greenery into a basket, resisting the urge to sneeze. He needs to get this plant smaller so he can move it.</p><p>“I can’t tell if you were trying to be Cyno or not,” she says and it takes Al-Haitham a moment to realize what she means. Once he does, he does not dignify that with a response. </p><p>Dehya fills him in on the goings on in Aaru Village and further expeditions in the sands. Senior Faruzan’s been making bolder excursions deeper in, and there’s that fellow from the Inter-Darshan competition, somewhat simplistically referred to as Hat Man, and of course Layla, although at least Layla seems somewhat more aware of her visits out there than she used to be.</p><p>“When are you coming around next?” Dehya asks, stretching her leg out to poke his ankle. “Come get some desert plants to add to your collection, make a proper Sumeru garden.”</p><p>“What is a proper Sumeru garden?” Al-Haitham asks, pressing his ankle back against her foot before retreating to continue sneezing.</p><p>“Are you allergic to your own garden? You’re a little far into it to be discovering that now, aren’t you? Hey, are these the ones that Lord Kusanali gave you?” Dehya asks, tipping her chin to indicate the blackberry he’s currently attempting to get under some semblance of control.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Now you have to learn how to make something with blackberries.”</p><p>“There is the chance it will not fruit.”</p><p>“You sound hopeful.”</p><p>Al-Haitham waves around them. “I wonder why. What would I do with blackberries?”</p><p>“I did just say you could learn to make something with blackberries.” And then, because Dehya  sometimes uses her sharpness to make sure no one gets complacent, Dehya says, “You know, now that I really think about it properly, and look closely, this suits you. You like it. It suits you.”</p><p>Al-Haitham turns to look at her. Her monicker is the lioness, but sometimes Al-Haitham looks her in the eye and thinks of mountains. He thinks of the thin air, he thinks of the sharpness of the breathing, the burning of the limbs. He thinks of the sharp contrast of stone and snow and ice. He thinks of the sprawl of sky and he thinks of the dizzying, staggering, spread of the world from the peak that looks like the spread of a wave upon the shore, as though the world was liquid and the stone is the only thing real. Everything kneels at the foot of stone. Even the sky must bend its neck.</p><p>“How do you come to this conclusion?”</p><p>“If you like something, it suits you. You grow to fit the things you like. Or maybe you don’t. I’m not thinking too hard about it, but I’ve decided that I feel that this suits you,” she says. “It doesn’t matter if it does or doesn’t, but I feel that it does. Do you disagree?”</p><p>“Yes,” Al-Haitham answers. “But I am enjoying it, and that’s the part that matters, is it not?”</p><p>Dehya smiles, the sun bending to fit the shape of stone. “Now we are in agreement, Al-Haitham. Maybe you should quit the Akademiya and work with me. I promise I won’t upend bags of boring locks on you to deal with or make you read through any really badly written reports. But you would have to put up with some sand. A lot of sand.”</p><p>Al-Haitham wrinkles his nose at the mention of sand. Dehya laughs, shuffling over to crouch next to him. She touches her bare shoulder to his, she is cool from being in the shade. Al-Haitham leans against her. She leans into him.</p><p>She reaches out and carefully holds onto the blackberry shrub’s too small pot as Al-Haitham resumes trying to loosen the soil enough that he can pull it out and move it to a larger one.</p><p>“I could,” Al-Haitham says, “But if I did that, who would take care of my garden? Should we switch places?”</p><p>Unfortunately for him, the blackberry plant does bear fruit. A lot of fruit. A truly disproportionate amount considering how hard he worked to keep the thing contained.</p><p>In the shaded corner of the garden, at the corner where kitchen and front room would meet, Nahida sits at one of the two chairs next to the small round table. Al-Haitham eventually brought in a second chair to sit across from the first. It is rarely occupied and it seems strange to have in a place with only one occupant. It matches neither the first chair nor the table. But not much in the garden really matches anyway, and Al-Haitham saw it and liked it, so he bought it. It is not a waste of mora because rarely occupied does not mean never occupied. </p><p>Right now, it is the throne for the Archon of his country as she feasts on the spoils of his garden as it comes to its first full fruition, with every plant mature enough to yield something and deciding to do it all at once.</p><p>The berries have stained her fingers and she is watching the slow progress of a lizard along the edge of a wooden shelf of pots. The garden is a riot of every color and many smells.</p><p>Al-Haitham sits across from her, reading through a letter that Kaveh had sent with an enclosed picture. The picture is taken from somewhere on Fontaine’s coast, facing towards Sumeru. Kaveh writes —<em> You are somewhere here, in this direction. I know I cannot, but sometimes when I look, I imagine I can see the Divine Tree. And if I can see the Divine Tree, I can see you. I can see the house. The flowers. The water will carry me to you, to Sumeru. I will be miserable the entire trip back. It’s been too long since I complained about being seasick. The people of Fontaine are mutants. They are as fish. Even the pyro allogenes. I have not learned how to swim any better. I am told it helps to keep your eyes on something in the distance — on a fixed point. I think this is the trick to dancing, too. My eyes are fixed on a tree I see when my eyes are closed. Does the point have to be real for it to work?</em></p><p>Kaveh has at least a month left in this academic term before he returns, and as much as Kaveh seems to want to be back in Sumeru, he is also taking something of the long way around — sightseeing on the way back, skirting around the edges of Mond and Liyue before circling back by boat to Sumeru. When Kaveh returns, he won’t have much time for holidays and sabbaticals. Apparently he is already lining up commissions for his return, and the Kshahrewar are eager for the return of their pride, their conflicting and challenging sometimes-joy.</p><p>Perhaps Kaveh will return in time for the Queen of the Night’s to bloom. Perhaps not. With the way things are looking in the garden, he will be back in time for some sort of fruit or vegetable to present itself.</p><p>Al-Haitham sets the letter on the table along with the photograph. He looks at Nahida, his god and Archon. His strange sponsor.</p><p>“How did you know?” He asks. Nahida does not need him to clarify what he means. They are sitting in the middle of the question right now.</p><p>Nahida’s eyes sparkle. “One of my titles is Steward of the World Tree. Do you know what this means?”</p><p>“I take it you are not referring to a literal meaning in this context.”</p><p>“The role of a steward is to tend, to guide, to assist. The World Tree is the knowledge of all things — everything is connected to this tree: past, present, even potential futures. As such, I believe that it is not only enough for me to tend to the tree, but to tend to you, those who come together to become part of the network that this tree grows upon, you who later are born from this tree in other forms.”</p><p>Al-Haitham is not here to discuss philosophy about reincarnation and thoughts on cyclical natures. And if they got into that line of questioning, including information about the World Tree, they would be here for weeks.</p><p>“Alright. Thank you for that information, Lord Kusanali. And now what is the real reason, <em>Nahida</em>?”</p><p>Nahida laughs. The edges of her mouth are stained with blackberry juice. “Alright, don’t look so cross, Al-Haitham. It is simply because I am fond of you. You are one of mine and I truly do care for you. You were one of mine before I fully understood what it meant to belong to something and to have something belong to you in return. I have seen and experienced what it is like to belong to you firsthand, Al-Haitham, to be chosen as something worth your attention. And the thought that <em>you</em> thought yourself incapable of care made me incredibly sad.”</p><p>Nahida holds up the bowl of blackberries between them. He leans forward and takes one, dropping it into her sweating glass of water. He’s never studied the biology or nutritional needs of an Archon, but he’s not sending her back dehydrated. Cyno is still peeved at him for sending Collei back to him with so much food that he had to leave some in the Matra break-room.</p><p>(“Now they’ll be <em>expecting</em> me to be bringing them food,” Cyno said to him.</p><p>“You bring them food anyway,” Al-Haitham pointed out. For all that the General Mahamatra is still a feared figure within the Akademiya, to those working under him or used to working with him, Cyno is a leader who cares very deeply about how his subordinates see him and takes great pains to be approachable to them.</p><p>“I pay for take-away for them when I have the time to organize something,” Cyno corrected. “I don’t bring them<em> home cooked</em> meals.”</p><p>“This is a good time to start,” Al-Haitham said, thinking of the giant platter of biryani that he would never be able to finish.)</p><p>“You wanted to know what you were capable of. You had determined though your beginner’s attempts that you were not suited towards acts of care. You had originally surmised that you were the factor that must be removed in order for life to flourish, and that this was something about yourself that could not be helped or changed. Your original conclusion was that there was something innate to your own nature that did not allow for the type of care that would allow you to grow or nurture life. This is, perhaps, too strong of a subject to have approached with something as mundane as a garden. How can we judge someone for their lack or possession of a green thumb?”</p><p>Al-Haitham would point out that if someone can’t take care of a simple pot of seeds, then that would be a fair assessment for their ability to care for anything more complex than that. It is a simplistic comparison that ignores several other factors, but it would be much like giving a small child a fish and telling them that if they could keep a fish alive then maybe they could work their way up to a cat or a dog. This is not a practice he particularly agrees with, but the theory behind it — if stripped down to the bare bones of the sentiment behind it — he could follow the logic through on.</p><p>“Now, I could have pointed this out to you, but your mind was already set,” she says. “Researcher’s bias. You were too attached to your experiment as it was, and the hypothesis and conclusion you had reached under unfair terms. You were using half-dead seeds and you had no real experience or guidance in the subject.”</p><p>Al-Haitham will concede to that. Upon reflection and looking back at his early observation logs he can see the clear gaps in his knowledge that caused those early attempts to go poorly. And he can read in his own hand how he was already predisposed towards failure as the outcome. </p><p>He pointedly stares at the glass. Nahida pops another blackberry into her mouth, but smiles and takes up the water to take a long drink from it. While Al-Haitham is thinking over what she’s said so far, Nahida looks around them, eyes drawn to watching three hummingbirds chasing and chirping at each other for the offense of being perceivable in the same location as each other. Al-Haitham has a suspicion that this has been a discussion a long time coming, one that Nahida has been looking forward to having since the very beginning.</p><p>“I knew you were capable. <em>More</em> than capable,” Nahida continues when the hummingbirds chase themselves out of view. “The reasons I spoke of helping you before were true. It is rare for you to need help. And that which you have given to me so freely, I wanted to offer to you in return. Al-Haitham, in this way you remind me of myself. You do not know that which flows through you. The joy, the glory, the peace, the splendor. If you can forgive the imagery and metaphor, let me put it like this: we are all as glass prisms. We can see the light and colors that are made by others, but we are often unable to see our own until the product of it is revealed to us by external shadow or other perceivable result. So here is the result of your own light, Al-Haitham, made tangible and undeniable for all the world to see and know. Here is the proof of your splendor before you. Do you see it?”</p><p>“You’re eating it right now,” he says dryly. Her words remind him of what Kaveh said to him before he left. He wonders if the two of them have ever sat down and talked to one another outside of Akademiya business. It seems strange that they wouldn’t, but then again, why would they? Nahida has spoken to most of the people he knows, not all of them.</p><p>“Ah, but do you actually <em>see</em> it?” Nahida asks. “Let me elaborate to make sure we are speaking of the same thing. You read Rtawahist papers and journals so that you can better help young Layla with her coursework. You go sit with Lady Dunyarzad for an hour or two now and again to keep her company — firstly because Dehya asked you to, as your friend, and because while you don’t quite understand what it is to be lonely, you know that recovery is isolating and demoralizing at times. You let Cyno foist all of those locks onto you even when only one in perhaps a dozen is actually worth your attention. You carefully write out page after page after page of potential lesson plans for Collei to make sure that she not only has the proper background for the venture she is seeking to undergo, but also that she can understand how all of the things that the rest of you are teaching her are meant to work in coordination with one another. You are perhaps one of the only people in the Akademiya who speaks to Faruzan normally and listens to her through the mind of a Haravatat scholar instead of a Kshahrewar or Vahumana one. You’ve gone through books and records for hours to help Nilou figure out a single detail for a performance. When Dehya speaks, you listen. These are simple examples of proof of your care. You hear us, Al-Haitham. You hear all of us and you take it all into you and you make it part of you. You return it to us in ways that we did not know to ask for, in ways that only you know how. What is care if not that?”</p><p>“These are things I have only recently begun to do,” Al-Haitham points out.</p><p>“That is only because you have recently met these people and understood what you have observed from being near them,” Nahida replies. “If we were to turn back to prior examples. Well.” Nahida’s eyes purposefully move towards the photograph and letter between them. “We don’t need to belabor that specific example. In any case — the idea that you are <em>incapable</em> of care, Al-Haitham, has always been laughable to me. If you did not care, I would not be sitting here. I imagine most of Sumeru would not be extant at all, really, to care about. To grow a plant, one must understand its needs. There are the obvious things: adequate light, good soil, and consistent water and avoiding extremes in temperature. But as you have learned, each plant — even within the same species, the same set of sprouts from the same group of seeds — requires individual care and attention. Plants do not speak. At least, not to you. You had to learn and observe them. You had to approach them on their own terms. The act of care is based upon one’s ability to listen. And you are very good at listening.”</p><p>“One could argue it is more about actions taken with what is heard.”</p><p>“And did you not take action? When it is needed of you, have you not always stepped forward to rise to the action you understood as needed, even when you could not understand the why of it? Even when it was not very pleasant, and when it has turned against you — when it has been held against you as a grudge, as resentment and distrust? There is so much to learn from you, in this regard. And that is something that everyone who has met you and has known your care can agree on. Through you, Al-Haitham, the rest of us are humbled. Through you, the rest of us can find inspiration and motivation in one. Through you, it is easy to see the clear way forward, even if it is not the most <em>pleasant</em> way forward. You are excellence, Al-Haitham. You are beyond nurture and you are beyond nature. You are wholly and unrepentantly yourself, and as much as this self of yours can be frustrating and incomprehensible, the pride you take in being that self is incredibly inspiring. Especially when you apply yourself with such transparency and sincerity. Quite often, when I find myself stuck on something, wavering between options, I find myself thinking about what you would do.”</p><p>Al-Haitham feels his mouth press together, lips flat. This seems overly much. But if that is her opinion he’s not going to argue with her over it. And she knows it. </p><p>“Why blackberries?”</p><p>“Double-blind,” Nahida replies instantly. “I really didn’t know that they were blackberries. I needed a mystery that would keep you occupied long enough to get truly invested for long enough that the rest of it would come to be. I didn’t want to know what it was because if I knew what it was I might be tempted to give you hints. Or I might have given something away on accident. You really are<em> too clever</em>, it’s what gets you thinking yourself into these tangles, like so. In any case, the first layer of questions you applied to this original experiment was easily understood and confirmed with one or two repetitions of the action. The truer more philosophical nature of the experiment needed time to unfold and I needed to make sure you would be invested in it long enough for it to get a chance at showing you results.”</p><p>“You play a very long game, Nahida.”</p><p>“I play on the scale of gods, Al-Haitham. And aren’t you a little bit pleased that I do?” Nahida smiles. Al-Haitham feels the slightest touch of her at the back of his head, on the other side of himself where the power of dendro lathes against the border of conscious thought, like light, like temperature, like sound. “It gave the rest time to grow and take root within you.”</p><p>Nahida turns away from him to look over the small space of the garden, overflowing with all manner of color and shape.</p><p>“That was what the second part of your experiment was about, wasn’t it? If it did not exist, could it be <em>encouraged</em> to exist — learned, adapted, acquired? Could an ability to care, to nurture, <em>be</em> nurtured where it was not previously? And how would you know that if you did not give it a chance to grow? Again, Al-Haitham, the idea that you were not capable is outrageous to me. It would be something like saying that Cyno’s not capable of discretion. It’s so very clearly part of you. Anyway. I needed something that would take a while to grow and complete to maturity so that you would continue with the experiment long enough for you to look and understand the rest of it. So now, looking around yourself, at the tangible proof of your capability and your capacity, do you see the proof of what the rest of us have known, even if we have not always been grateful for it?”</p><p>Al-Haitham looks away from her blackberry stained hands, away from the little table with the bowl of fruit and the letter and the photograph. He looks into the sun and shadow-dappled garden before them. Fat bees hover over flowers. Leaves rustle from the occasional movement of a lizard, of some small hiding creature. The water of the pond burbles softly. The hummingbird feeder sways gently in the wake of the small birds fighting near it as they zip away once more. A butterfly, simultaneously languid and jittery flutters in through the open square of sky above them, momentarily blending into the riot of flowers that the roses and jasmine make.</p><p>When Al-Haitham breathes in, the air is heavy with life. It tastes green, for the lack of a better descriptor.</p><p>The things Nahida speaks of are small things to him. Inconsequential. He hadn’t even thought of them as they occurred. He saw a need that he could fill, that wouldn’t bother him to deal with, that would quite potentially be trouble later down the line, and handled it before it could develop into something further. There was something that required doing, he was capable of doing it, he did it. There was something he thought he might like to do so he tried it. Al-Haitham did not do any of the things she seems to be alluding to out of any specific sense of kindness.</p><p>Quite frankly, for some of the things she’s mentioned, he gained something in return. These were not altruistically done.</p><p>Al-Haitham genuinely does find some measure of interest in reviewing Layla’s work with her. He’s never truly done a deep dive on any Rtawahist works, and going through her papers and asking her questions had been elucidating to him. She is also not poor company to be around, and usually talks to herself if he’s not directly addressing her. It’s much the same with Lady Dunyarzad. Her family’s estate is quiet, the refreshments on hand are quite good, and when they do speak Lady Dunyarzad has proved herself to be a refreshing conversational partner with an impressive range of knowledge that would put many of the Vahumana and Haravatat scholars on the back foot. Most importantly, Lady Dunyarzad knows how to appreciate a good silence.</p><p>While Al-Haitham isn’t exactly <em>pleased</em> with being the Matra test subject for testing security measures, he has to admit that at least some of them are interesting enough for him to spend time on. Most are not, but for every ten to twenty mundane locks or cyphers Cyno has thrown his way there’s been at least one that proved challenging enough for him to actually bring out his picks.</p><p>Collei’s coursework is a matter of necessity, one he doesn’t mind handling as the one with the most experience in such matters. She has five of the most preeminent minds of the Akademiya attempting to lend a hand in her education. Five different styles of teaching, five different subjects, five different modalities of thought and educational philosophy. This is a suitable challenge to balance and Al-Haitham doesn’t mind it, it’s broadening his own knowledge as he works with Cyno, Tighnari, Senior Faruzan, and Kaveh to make sure they’re all somewhat coordinating their efforts. </p><p>What is so special of how he interacts with Senior Faruzan? Is it not the same as how he interacts with anyone else? How else would he interact with her? What is so special about the way he treats her? If he shows her any deference, it is because she truly is an expert in her specific field deserving of such respect. It’s not as though he knows better than she does. </p><p>As for Nilou — well. It’s not as though he isn’t interested in the topics. He is a swordsman, even if it is not how he would primarily introduce himself. And he does enjoy stories and how language, culture, and time shapes them and passes them around. Nilou’s interpretations of certain stories and her unique background in dance provide new and interesting insights he would never have thought of on his own. And she has a talent for explaining them. Nilou gives a certain weight to her words that most others do not care to consider. He respects this about her.</p><p>And Dehya — what’s there to be said? Why <em>wouldn’t</em> he listen to Dehya?</p><p>Al-Haitham closes his eyes, tipping his head back as he listens to the sound of birds and water. </p><p>No. He doesn’t see what she means. </p><p>But had she not just said as much? Had Kaveh not explained it to him before he left? Isn’t that the point of their differences? Bias and perspectives, a matter of cause and effect. Perhaps he cannot see or understand what the rest of them see and understand of him. But he can understand that they are seeing something — that they are seeing something in him. He might not agree with it, but that’s not his problem to address. He has what he wanted — needed.</p><p>When it comes down to it — he did not do this for anyone else. He did not ask this question in order to give an answer to anyone but himself, and he <em>does</em> have those answers. He has his answers several times over. He has been content with them. He has been satisfied with them. And he has moved on from them.</p><p>Al-Haitham does not see the other answers that everyone else seems to see. But he does see this —<em> his garden</em>. He sees the result of work and careful study. Al-Haitham sees the results of that which he applied himself to, and chose to take up for his own.</p><p>Almost two years ago, Al-Haitham saw it fit to try his hand at gardening, at growing. And when Al-Haitham looks around himself now, at the climbing vines, the spills of petals, the shining variegation of leaf, he can see that at least. </p><p>Al-Haitham lets his eyes lazily move over leaf, over fruit, over flower, over stem and stalk, over bark and vine. He thinks of the barren space that once was and the half-withered away pots of onion, of mint, of aloe. Al-Haitham thinks of the dusty stones and beaten dirt and he thinks of the stillness, the emptiness of the space. He thinks of those several failed first attempts. He thinks of his hands in the soil, he thinks of the excitement and the curiosity that followed with the first pale green sprouts. Al-Haitham thinks of the slow arranging and rearranging of pots to understand what works and why, what doesn’t and why not. He thinks back towards the building of the shelves, the trellises. Al-Haitham thinks of the building of the pond and the careful anchoring of plants as he waited for them to take root on their own. He thinks of releasing the first fish and of the little aquatic snail that’s still going about somewhere in the shaded depths of the pond. He thinks of all of the changes that have come around through his hand and through his choices.</p><p>And then he stops thinking and actually looks at it all.</p><p>What does he see?</p><p>Within him, a river of green thoughts in a deeper world that escapes word. And around him, a garden presenting the fruit of two years worth of labor and dedication, a miniature world of its own that is part of him and is not, but remains his just as he, in his own way, belongs to it.</p><p>This is an answer, in its own form, that is for him and him alone. It is the one that matters the most.</p><p>Does he see?</p><p>“I do. I do.”</p>
