<p>Shen Qingqiu wakes up, and the world that he sees when he opens his eyes is a vast expanse of grey. He’s kneeling on a grey stone slab in the middle of the water prison, with his arms bound painfully behind his back and legs folded underneath him. The waterfall mechanism is temporarily down, and he’s surrounded by an endless sea of murky grey water. When he looks up, there’s nothing but jagged stone walls in the distance, enclosing on him from all sides.</p><p>Here, imprisoned in the Huan Hua Water Prison, the only accompaniment he has is the trickling of the water as the waves laps against the rocks, the distant sounds of the waterfall hitting the stones and seeping into the ground, and the biting cold that leaves him shivering at night once the sun sets.</p><p>The longer he’s here, the more surreal it feels. </p><p>On Qing Jing peak, the silence is a tranquil blanket of comfort, and the breeze that blows past is a gentle spring caress against his skin. Here, the silence of the water prison is deafeningly loud. It eats away at him from the inside, and the cold breeze that trails in from the openings of the caves bites harshly at his skin, leaving it red and numb.</p><p>It’s funny how much things can change all in a single day.</p><p>In the periphery of his vision, he sees a flicker of black and red in his world of grayscale tones. Shen Qingqiu would recognise that figure anywhere.</p><p>The figure makes his way over, and Shen Qingqiu shifts on his knees to sit himself upright, ignoring the sharp prick of pain that runs up his legs when his knee presses against a jagged edge of the rock on the stone platform. It’s hard to move about like this, with his arms bound behind his back.</p><p>“Binghe,” he greets eventually when the figure is close enough to be standing right before him. His voice comes out slightly raspy from the cold harsh hair that he’s been breathing in.</p><p>Luo Binghe looms over him, and Shen Qingqiu takes in the sight of the blackened protagonist. Binghe is no longer dressed in the familiar colours of white and pale greens, the colours of Qing Jing Peak. Instead, he’s dressed in a mix of red and black, ostentatiously vivid in the dull expanse of grey Shen Qingqiu has gotten used to.</p><p>It leaves a bitter taste in his mouth and a painful squeeze in his chest—</p><p>—This Luo Binghe is a Luo Binghe that Shen Qingqiu is no longer able to to recognise.</p><p>Gone was his white lotus disciple from their easier, carefree days. Gone were the days Luo Binghe would shyly gaze up at him with admiration in his eyes, seeking his approval. Gone were the days they would bask contentedly in the presence of each other’s company.</p><p>The pang of nostalgia and guilt hits harder than Shen Qingqiu expects. He’s driven his pure, innocent disciple to this. If Shen Qingqiu had never listened to the system— if he had refused to push Binghe down the abyss, then perhaps things would never have turned out this way.</p><p>Wasn’t Binghe’s blackening all his fault? </p><p>In exchange for his own life, Shen Qingqiu had chosen to sacrifice Binghe— broke his trust, rejected him, stabbed him, threw him down the abyss.</p><p>Cared for him, gave him hope, <em> loved </em>him— and then ripped it away cruelly all in a single breath. </p><p>How was he any different from the scum that he’d painted the original Shen Qingqiu to be, with the things he did?</p><p>A fitting host for a fitting soul. It’s disgusting how he’s worn the skin of the scum villain Shen Qingqiu so well and so naturally that it has practically melded in his bones and turned him into the person who he is now.</p><p>“Shizun,” Binghe greets back, snapping Shen Qingqiu out of his spiral of thoughts. Binghe’s demon mark glows in the dim lighting of the water prison, and it flashes as red as his eyes. </p><p>He’s not hiding his mark, Shen Qingqiu realises. What was the point, when they were the only ones present in this prison? There is no need for any pretenses of the sort— for Binghe to continue pretending to be the little sheep that he is not. The other disciples of Huan Hua Palace aren’t present.</p><p>It is only the two of them.</p><p>A captive prisoner, and the child he’s hurt— the child who has turned black, the child who will carve him into a human stick.</p><p>The child who has grown into the blackened protagonist of the novel he’d read in his past life, who is no longer a child but a cruel and twisted man bent on taking revenge, who has schemed and plotted his way to have Shen Qingqiu fall from grace and meet his end.</p><p>The panic wells up from within, almost like a hysterical fit rising in violent tides and threatening to burst from under his skin. He’s at Binghe’s mercy, bound and helpless. He’s going to get carved into a human stick, ripped from limb to limb, chained and hung up for display, with empty sockets for eyes and a blood-filled mouth, bloody tongue and limbs strewn on the floor—</p><p>—Shen Qingqiu takes a sharp intake of breath and forces it down, the welling panic and the bile in his throat. He hopes he looks as unfrazzled as he thinks he does. It takes some effort and a few more intakes of air, deep and slow through his nose, for his vision to clear enough to focus on the red and black in his world of grey.</p><p>Luo Binghe is gingerly carrying a wooden bamboo tray. And in a series of actions that makes absolutely no sense, he folds his knees in a kneel, and settles the tray in front of Shen Qingqiu.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu’s gaze immediately shifts to the tray placed before him.</p><p>He blinks.</p><p>Congee…?</p><p>“This disciple has taken the liberty to prepare Shizun’s meals until the trial commences,” Luo Binghe says once he’s settled the tray on the ground, folding his palms over his lap. He fixes his gaze onto Shen Qingqiu, eyes a burning red. “Pray that Shizun still finds this disciple’s cooking to his tastes.”</p><p>The congee introduces a myriad of colours to Shen Qingqiu's world of grey. It's a pure, unblemished white, topped with scallions and thinly sliced ginger and meat, fresh like snow and still steaming hot. On its side lies another small dish, filled with braised peanuts marinated in soy sauce. </p><p>Shen Qingqiu remains silent, gaze transfixed on the bowl of congee, freshly prepared and still piping hot. He can feel the warmth from the congee spreading through his skin down to the tip of his fingers.</p><p>The last time he's had Binghe's congee was on the day of the Immortal Alliance Conference. Binghe had woken up at dusk to prepare it for him, eyes still ridden with sleep. It's also the same congee as the one he had several days after the demonic invasion led by Sha Hualing, when he was recuperating from his injury from the poisoned spikes of the Elder Hammer Demon— the very first dish Binghe had personally cooked for him, the first of the many that were to come. </p><p>It had been his favourite. </p><p>It still is.</p><p>A complex feeling washes over him like a flood. </p><p>Shen Qingqiu breathes, and snaps his eyelids shut. </p><p>Was this perhaps an attempt to remind him of the day of the Conference, where he had pushed Binghe down into the abyss with his own two hands? Was this a warning and a threat; a reminder of his wrongdoings? </p><p>—But how could he forget? </p><p>The tremble in his arms as he held Xiu Ya, impaled into Binghe's chest. The painful thumps of Binghe's heart beating and travelling up the blade, through the hilt of his sword and into his hand. The rushing of his own blood to his head, pounding at his ears. </p><p>The broken smile on Binghe's face, tear stains accompanying trembling lips. The heart-wrenching twist and the smooth, wet slide of Xiu Ya through Binghe’s chest when Shen Qingqiu wrenched it out. The flash of hope in his eyes, fleeting like a glimmer in the night sky, amidst the splatter of fresh warm blood onto the ground—</p><p>—how it all crumbled into despair when Shen Qingqiu shoved him down. </p><p>The way Binghe had still reached out for him mid-fall despite all that—</p><p>—How was he to forget?</p><p>…</p><p>Shen Qingqiu dreams frequently, of peaceful mornings and the distant echoes of his rowdier disciples outside his bamboo house, happy and cheerful. Of a young boy, with bright shining eyes and an adoring gaze standing by his bedside when he wakes. </p><p>He also dreams frequently, of Binghe trembling and falling to his knees before him, of crimson blood staining the tip of his sword red. Of Binghe's shaky pleas, of the hurt and despair twisting his face. </p><p>Even after three years, Binghe's expression as he fell still remains vivid in Shen Qingqiu's memories. </p><p>It's something Shen Qingqiu will never be able to forget. </p><p>"Is Shizun not in the mood for congee today? I remember it to be Shizun’s favourite dish," Binghe speaks up eventually, when the silence between them drags on for too long. He acts out a faux and cheap imitation of what their days used to be. </p><p>Shen Qingqiu feels sick to his stomach. </p><p>"This disciple can prepare something else, Shizun need only instruct this disciple to do so."</p><p>Binghe sounds hesitant, and the way he holds himself, the way he's kneeling— it's all so familiar to Shen Qingqiu that he can't help but see the white lotus disciple he's raised instead of the blackened protagonist here before him. </p><p>"What is the meaning of this?" Shen Qingqiu’s voice sounds distant even to himself as he tears his gaze away from the protagonist kneeling before him. He doesn't understand why Binghe would fall back into their previous loving master and disciple dynamic. They have long lost that easy familiarity with each other— Shen Qingqiu had brutally ripped it apart when he'd pushed Luo Binghe into the abyss three years ago. </p><p>Binghe doesn't quite understand what he's getting at, though. Instead, his gaze is earnest as he looks at Shen Qingqiu. "Shizun should eat," he explains. "The immortal binding cable blocks all qi pathways.  Shizun should not practice inedia now that Shizun's body is but a mortal shell.."</p><p>It doesn't answer his question, but it brings about a new wave of turbulent emotions, stifling and heavy, as he contemplates over Binghe's words. </p><p>Eat?</p><p>
<em> How? </em>
</p><p>How was he supposed to eat, if his hands and arms were bound by a hundred over immortal binding cables? Did Binghe expect him to eat it off the ground, to grovel at his feet, live humiliatingly off his provisions, subjected to his whims and mercy? </p><p>In the first place, wasn’t it all because of Binghe that he’s stuck here like this, reduced to a mortal shell of himself?</p><p>"This master might be a prisoner placed under your custody, but I naturally still retain my dignity," Shen Qingqiu answers stiffly. </p><p>His answer seemingly takes Binghe by surprise, and Binghe's neutral expression immediately cracks at his refusal. </p><p>There is a moment of silence. </p><p>"Shizun must really despise demons then, to be willing to starve even under such conditions." Binghe's smile turns icy cold, and Shen Qingqiu is quite literally able to feel the cold flames of anger rolling off Binghe in waves. Despite this, Binghe doesn't move an inch from his spot. He remains kneeling rigidly before him, hands clenched into tight fists at his lap. "Or is it just this particular demon that Shizun despises? <em> Dignity?"</em> He laughs bitterly in a mocking imitation of Shen Qingqiu. "Is this disciple's cooking too filthy for Shizun to eat, now that half my blood reigns from the demons that Shizun abhors so?"</p><p>Shen Qingqiu blinks, thrown for a loop. </p><p>No? Shizun just doesn't want to eat food off the ground like some cow?? Shen Qingqiu thinks incredulously, but Binghe’s smile is so icy that Shen Qingqiu chooses to remain silent in fear of further angering the protagonist. Instead, he shifts his gaze back to the bowl of congee sitting before him.</p><p>If Shen Qingqiu hadn't read the original PIDW, hadn't known the type of cruel person the original Luo Binghe had turned out to be, he would have thought that in his cold fury, Binghe had actually sounded a little sad. But Shen Qingqiu has long since accepted the fact that he had killed his Binghe, his innocent naive disciple with a bleeding heart, with his own two hands. </p><p>This Binghe, who kneels rigidly before him with flashing red eyes and a cruel smile, isn’t his Binghe. He’s the blackened stallion protagonist from the original PIDW, the Binghe who will rule the demon and human realm with a cruel iron fist, who will have a multitude of wives at his beckoning, who’s out for revenge against his Shizun who threw him into a place worse than hell.</p><p>“Shizun doesn’t have a choice,” Luo Binghe speaks up again coldly, seeing that Shen Qingqiu was intent on remaining silent. His eyes bore holes into Shen Qingqiu’s, burning with a fervent sort of possessiveness that leaves him unsettled. “Shizun will have to eat, eventually. No one else but this disciple is allowed to step foot in this prison. No one else but this disciple is allowed to prepare and serve you food. No one else but this disciple is allowed to see to your needs. Shizun, you can <em> only </em>rely on this disciple. This is a futile struggle.”</p><p>Shen Qingqiu swallows a lump in his throat, feels a shiver run up his spine. “...Why go through all this?” He asks instead, his voice coming out raspy and dry. </p><p>He’s unable to understand why Binghe would choose this form of humiliation, when the trial is only a month away— when he already has Shen Qingqiu in his grasp, trapped in his web of schemes he has carefully laid out. </p><p>“This master has already played right into your hands. Am I not already imprisoned here, just as you wished?”</p><p>Almost immediately, a look of frustration flashes across Binghe’s face at his words, and his lips curl into a sneer. “As expected, Shizun really does think quite wretchedly of me. Sure, this disciple might be a demon, and is keeping Shizun here temporarily for several reasons, but—”</p><p>Upset, Binghe abruptly cuts himself off, seemingly giving up on explaining himself in his anguish. “—Does Shizun really believe this is all a scheme set up by this disciple?” </p><p>“Was it not?” Shen Qingqiu asks in return, and Luo Binghe scowls.</p><p>“Then, may I dare ask, is every unfortunate turn of event, every single drop of blood that’s spilled, every flicker of life extinguished— must they all be my fault?” Binghe shoots back angrily. His clenched fists tremble at his lap, knuckles white as he speaks. </p><p>“May I dare ask, was everything Shizun told me all a lie? Was it all a farce? That not all humans are inherently good, and likewise, not all demons are evil, that every being has a right to live— Shizun, why am I the exception to this?” </p><p>His voice grows harsher and shakier as he continues angrily, almost rambling. “Shizun, those words you spoke of that night, you don’t know how much they mean to me. I hear these words, again and again, in the figment of my dreams I conjure up in the abyss. Deliberate, intentional dreams just so I could find the will to keep going. Unconscious, involuntary dreams even when I’m bleeding out moments away from dying in the hell you threw me in.”</p><p>“...”</p><p>“Shizun, when you said all demons, has it never included me? Did Shizun really mean it, when you said that the place where I truly belong, is not by your side, but hell itself?”</p><p>For every word that leave Binghe’s lips, every question Binghe asked, Shen Qingqiu’s mind flashes back to that heartbreaking scene at the opening of the abyss. </p><p>He remembers the tears streaking down Binghe’s face, the tremble in his arms as he held Xiu Ya, the way he had cowardly looked <em> through </em>Binghe instead of at him when Binghe had asked him this very same question back then—</p><p>Ah, he had really…</p><p>He had really forsaken his disciple back then, hadn’t he?</p><p>Shen Qingqiu is unable to bring himself to say anything. Afterall, he had, indeed, said all those words himself, and pushed Binghe down. </p><p>At his silence, Binghe’s lips curve up into a bitter smile as he reaches his own understanding. “I see,” he says, and in that instance, the words that had left Binghe’s lips had come out so softly Shen Qingqiu can’t help but feel a pang in his heart.</p><p>Then, without another word, Luo Binghe stands, and stiffly clasps his fists into a bow. “Since my presence here is unwanted, this disciple shall take his leave first.” Binghe’s tone is flat, almost mechanical. Clearly holding himself back from lashing out with emotions, Luo Binghe grits his teeth, and turns to stalk out of the water prison.</p><p>Feeling almost as if he’s a single mother watching her teenage son throw a temper tantrum (rightfully so), Shen Qingqiu is only able to watch after the retreating back of Luo Binghe for a few seconds, before the waterfall mechanism slams back into place and he is once again enclosed by the acid waterfall. The bowl of congee remains untouched in front of Shen Qingqiu, still steaming hot, and when Shen Qingqiu stares at it, he sees flashes of memories instead of the snowy white congee.</p><p align="center">
<em> “Shizun!” </em>
</p><p align="center">
<em> “Shizun, should this disciple prepare some snacks?” </em>
</p><p align="center">
<em> “Towards painful bitterness and hardships, Binghe is fearless and only asks to be strong enough to protect his important people!” </em>
</p><p align="center">
<em> “But Shizun, you’ve said before that people can be good or evil, and that demons can also be good or evil.” </em>
</p><p align="center">
<em> “Shizun, really wants to kill me...?” </em>
</p><p align="center">
<em> “Shizun…?” </em>
</p><p>...</p><p>Perhaps…</p><p>Perhaps, staying here wasn’t all too bad. </p><p>If his presence could alleviate Binghe’s grief by even just the slightest amount, then Shen Qingqiu will willingly stay by Binghe’s side, as his prisoner, until the very last moment.</p><p>It’s what he owes him, after all.</p><hr/><p>Luo Binghe visits again the next day.</p><p>This time, in addition to freshly made noodles, Binghe also brings over an exquisite blend of tea, freshly brewed in a clay pot, alongside a plate of glutinous rice cakes stuffed with a variety of different fillings— all of which, Shen Qingqiu notes, are still his favourites even after three long years.</p><p>The glutinous rice cakes are small and round, shaped delicately into plum blossoms and lotus flowers, white and pink dusting beautifully over the soft skin of the pastry. It’s ridiculously cute and almost too pretty to eat, and Shen Qingqiu blithely wonders if he’s still dreaming.</p><p>Luo Binghe, the blackened protagonist, painstakingly kneading and shaping the dough; pinching carefully at the pastry, molding it with flour-dusted fingers, into the shape of <em> flowers</em>—</p><p>—It’s too wild a scenario for Shen Qingqiu to even begin imagining.</p><p>“Shizun must be feeling hungry by now,” Binghe comments dutifully as he kneels and settles the tray before Shen Qingqiu, much like how he had done the previous day. He says nothing about the frankly horrendous interaction they had yesterday, and remains tight-lipped about it. “Apologies for not being able to come by earlier; this disciple is inadequate and has made Shizun wait.” </p><p>Then, he arranges the food, lifting the plates and bowls off the tray and placing it on the stone ground. He nudges the plate of glutinous rice cakes towards Shen Qingqiu. “Shizun didn’t really have an appetite yesterday, so this disciple has taken the liberty to prepare some of Shizun’s favourite pastries. Shizun can snack on the pastries instead if he so wishes.”</p><p>Luo Binghe paints the picture of a filial disciple, dedicated and earnest as he pours the tea into a small teacup. The tea is a pale amber, and the light and nutty fragrance that drifts over from the teapot brings another wave of nostalgia to Shen Qingqiu. It’s the very same one Binghe used to prepare for him three years ago back on Qing Jing peak on cold winter mornings and chilly autumn nights, brewed to just the perfect temperature it settles warmly in his body and brings a pleasant heated flush to his cheeks whenever he lifts the teacup and sips at it.</p><p><em> “This tea is good for fending off the cold, Shizun should take care to stay warm in this weather,” </em>Binghe had explained to him enthusiastically back then, eyes bright as he gazed up at a Shen Qingqiu who had been not so conspicuously bundled up in layers of blankets during a particularly cold winter morning. Back then, Binghe had still been a small thing, his head barely coming up to his chest. Now, Binghe towers over him effortlessly even when kneeling.</p><p>“This master isn’t hungry,” Shen Qingqiu immediately lies through his teeth, feeling his shackles rise at the oddity of the entire situation. </p><p>What was Luo Binghe planning this time? To lovingly brew tea and make him pastries, delicate and intricate down to every last detail, from the folds of the petals to the stems of the leafs— it must have taken Binghe a painstakingly long amount of time and effort, even with his god-tier cooking skills. What Shen Qingqiu doesn’t understand is <em> why </em>Binghe would feel the need to go through all this trouble, when he already has Shen Qingqiu in captivity. </p><p>Wouldn’t it be easier if Binghe simply just went ahead with his revenge rather than beat around the bush like this? Shen Qingqiu can’t help but feel like he was being toyed around with.</p><p>The corner of Binghe’s lips tilts ever so slightly downwards. “This again?” He sighs with a furrowed brow, looking displeased. “It doesn’t matter whether Shizun is hungry or not. A mortal body is not fit to practice inedia. Shizun doesn’t really have much of a choice, see?” Binghe finishes with a sharp smile, in which Shen Qingqiu is able to see the tightness of his jaw, the stiffness of his smile, and how close Binghe is to snapping.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu lets out an exhale through his nose. It’s only been a few minutes since they’ve started talking and he’s barely said anything much, but Luo Binghe already looks furious with him. </p><p>It hurts even more than Shen Qingqiu expects— that his relationship with his disciple whom he’d so painstakingly and lovingly brought up has deteriorated to the point where they’re unable to have even a single amiable conversation without hurting each other. It hurts to remember that they had once been a loving pair of master and disciple, and it hurts even more to know that he had torn this apart himself.</p><p>“There is always a choice,” Shen Qingqiu responds, and he can’t help but remember the wisps of black smoke drifting up high, the stench of blood permeating the air, crimson red dripping down the blades of Xiu Ya as he stood before the opening of the abyss. </p><p>His own words weigh heavily on him, twisting at his heart and heavy on his tongue. His words feel like they’re meant more for himself than for Binghe— for the Shen Qingqiu who had chosen to push his precious disciple into the abyss in exchange for his own life.</p><p>After all, hadn’t Shen Qingqiu been given a choice as well?</p><p>Between his precious disciple and his own meagre life, Shen Qingqiu had chosen to live.</p><p>It takes him a while to recollect himself. “This master appreciates Binghe’s efforts. Nevertheless, this is unnecessary.”</p><p> “<em>Unnecessary?”</em> The laugh that escapes Binghe’s lips is sharp and bitter. “Shizun really has a way with words. Won’t you be more forthcoming with this disciple? For Shizun to reject me so vehemently time and time again— rather than unnecessary, doesn’t Shizun actually mean to say that this disciple’s efforts, this disciple’s <em> presence</em>, is unwanted and unwelcome?”</p><p>Shen Qingqiu blinks, unsure of how to reply.</p><p>“How long, exactly, is Shizun planning to continue this?” He asks, and there’s a dangerous smile playing at his lips. “Or perhaps, is Shizun worried that I’ve poisoned the food? Shizun need not fret, this disciple has done nothing of the sort despite being a despicable demon that Shizun believes me to be.” His words come out mocking as he reaches out to pick up the pair of chopsticks gingerly.</p><p>He places a single rice cake, in the shape of a lotus flower, into his mouth, chews it slowly and swallows, his gaze never leaving Shen Qingqiu’s all the while. He does the same for the noodles and the tea; spoons a little of the soupy broth and brings it to his lips, sips at the tea with the same lips pressed lightly against porcelain.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu watches all this, distracted.</p><p>When Binghe is done and is still visibly sitting upright, he settles the teacup back onto the ground with a clink, the same mocking smile still etched onto his face. “Surprised?”</p><p>No, Shen Qingqiu thinks. No, he isn’t surprised in the slightest.</p><p>Binghe has the blood of a heavenly demon, how could ordinary poison work against him?</p><p>Anyway, he hadn’t even considered the possibility of Binghe poisoning his food until he’d brought it up himself, and Shen Qingqiu finds himself stunned speechless when he realises—</p><p>—Over his time living as Shen Qingqiu, he had already gotten so used to eating Binghe’s food, has already been conditioned in such a way that it was just natural for him to eat whatever Binghe prepares without questioning it. Even with his life in mortal peril under the hands of the blackened protagonist out for his life, Shen Qingqiu has never once actually considered Binghe’s dishes to be a threat.</p><p>It’s quite terrifying a realisation, in all honesty.</p><p>Binghe darts a tongue out to lick at his bottom lip. “Mn, not bad,” he hums, pleased, ignoring the fact that Shen Qingqiu has been silent for a long while now. “So, has Shizun changed his mind? The dishes aren’t poisoned, and this disciple remembers they’re Shizun’s favourites.”</p><p>Shen Qingqiu sighs. </p><p>“It defeats the purpose if Binghe is the one who consumes it. There is little to no poison the heavenly demon blood is unable to remove,” he says, matter-of-factly.</p><p>Binghe purses his lips, staring at him. </p><p>Then, softly, “Shizun really believes this disciple poisoned the food?””</p><p>“...This master doesn’t dare to guess.”</p><p>Binghe doesn’t reply immediately, and the silence that hangs over them feels like a heavy and suffocating pressure weighing down on Shen Qingqiu’s shoulders. Then—</p><p>“—<em>Shizun</em>,” Binghe’s voice cracks, still soft, and the suddenness and sheer vulnerability behind Binghe’s broken-hearted whisper takes Shen Qingqiu by surprise. When Shen Qingqiu looks back at him, the expression on Binghe’s face feels like a dagger to his heart.</p><p>Binghe looks—</p><p>Binghe looks sad.</p><p>He looks angry and lost and sad for some mystifying reason, and Shen Qingqiu…</p><p>...Shen Qingqiu doesn’t know what to do. </p><p>Unlike before, Shen Qingqiu couldn’t pat him on the head, ruffle his hair and dry his tears. Couldn’t embrace him in his arms, hold his cheek in the palm of his hand, wipe off his tears with the brush of his thumb. </p><p>He no longer has the right to.</p><p>And for Luo Binghe, receiving comfort from the one person he hated the most— the person who had hurt him and pushed him down the abyss— would probably seem like a bad joke. Shen Qingqiu wasn’t crazy enough to willingly jump from the boiling pot into the fire himself; his current situation was already bad enough.</p><p>Besides, with his arms bound like this, it’s not as if he could offer much comfort, either.</p><p>It doesn’t last for more than a second, though. Binghe’s expression twists into an angry scowl before Shen Qingqiu can even manage to call out his name, and it happens so fast that Shen Qingqiu wonders if the previous few moments were all figments of his imagination conjured from his wishful thinking and naive hopes that his white lotus disciple hasn’t disappeared completely.</p><p>Binghe stands abruptly, fists clenched at his sides. He knocks over the tea when he does so, and it splashes against the hem of his robe, spilling and seeping into the stone ground. Despite this, Binghe pays it no mind, his attention laser focused on Shen Qingqiu bound and kneeling before him.</p><p>“It seems like nothing this disciple does can change Shizun’s view of me,” his breath comes out shaky, red tinting the corner of his eyes.</p><p>Then, he laughs. </p><p>“Of course! After all, this disciple <em> is </em> a heavenly demon! A heavenly demon will <em> always </em>spill blood, massacre innocents and throw the world into chaos, isn’t that right, Shizun? Then, maybe this disciple shall do just that! Rid this world of those who’ve once stepped on me, laughed at me, cursed me! Spit on them, kick them, pierce their body with a thousand blades! Drown them in cold blood and tear their bodies apart!” </p><p>With a breathy chuckle, he pauses and looks at Shen Qingqiu with a mad gleam in his eyes, demonic energy clinging onto him like a second layer of skin. “Maybe I’ll start from Cang Qiong Sect, even! Since there’s no other way… Since there’s no other way for Shizun to see me for the person who I am, then I’ll just become the scum that Shizun insists me to be! <em> Maybe then, will Shizun finally look back at me?”</em>  </p><p>Shen Qingqiu watches in trepidation as the black mist envelops Binghe as he speaks, the demonic energy steadily rising in pulses. </p><p>“Luo Binghe!” He exclaims as a warning. The demonic energy of Xin Mo is relentless; it slowly consumes his wayward disciple, taking over his senses and eats away at his rationality.</p><p>“<em>Shizun</em>,” Binghe answers in response. His voice comes out wrought in twisted anger, low and rumbling, but the black mist subdues by just the slightest bit when Shen Qingqiu calls out his name.</p><p>“Binghe, control yourself,” Shen Qingqiu says cautiously once he has determined Binghe to be aware enough to listen and process his words. He ignores the painful squeeze in his heart and swallows down the lump in his throat at the sight of his precious disciple, reduced to a shell of resentful anger under the influence of Xin Mo. “Don’t let the demonic energy consume you.”</p><p>Binghe’s lip curves up. “Oh? Is Shizun showing concern for this disciple now? How surprising.”</p><p>“<em>Binghe</em>,” Shen Qingqiu urges, brows furrowing into a frown. Xin Mo was a dangerous entity, doubly so for its user. Luo Binghe, having emerged from the abyss years ahead of schedule, is unsurprisingly less prepared and equipped to deal with Xin Mo’s backlash. </p><p>Shen Qingqiu is unable to help the growing concern welling in his chest for the blackened protagonist standing before him.</p><p>Even if Binghe wanted to pay him back tenfold, humiliate him, torture him, rip off his limbs and turn him into a human stick, Binghe was still Shen Qingqiu’s precious disciple. Shen Qingqiu still cares, even if Binghe didn’t know.</p><p>It didn’t matter whether Binghe knew.</p><p>Luo Binghe, with his demon mark glowing brighter than ever and his robes fluttering heavily from the ripples in the air, continues gazing at him with bloodshot eyes. His fists remain clenched by his sides, and he bites at his lips so hard he draws blood.</p><p>Despite this, Binghe eventually calms. It takes a few moments of stifled, tense silence and Shen Qingqiu has to repeatedly coax Binghe out of his Xin Mo-induced anger, but the blackened protagonist’s murderous rage subsides nevertheless, the ripples of demonic energy dissipating along with the tension in the air.</p><p>“Shizun,” Binghe whispers, almost brokenly, once he’s regained his bearings. Visibly exhausted, the blackened protagonist looks so very small, much like a lost child, when he’s not consumed by anger and hate. </p><p>“Shizun,” Binghe whispers again. His fingers tremble at the side of his robes, and he clutches at the hems desperately, bites at his bloodied lips, stares at Shen Qingqiu with red-rimmed eyes. </p><p>Shen Qingqiu listens.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu listens to his name spilling out of Binghe’s lips like a broken record. </p><p>He listens to each breath Binghe takes, hears every minute tremble laced in his voice. But Binghe doesn’t say anything more than that, and when he leaves, Shen Qingqiu is left kneeling on the cold stone ground of the water prison, hearing the echoes of Binghe’s whispers in the deafening rush of the waterfall.</p><p>It accompanies him till he falls asleep, and accompanies him through his fitful dreams.</p><hr/><p>The events of the following few days occur in a similar fashion.</p><p>In Shen Qingqiu’s world of grey, Luo Binghe and the myriad of dishes he brings in is the only other reprieve Shen Qingqiu experiences. He brings in a palette of colours, striking against the dull grey hues of the water prison, from the red and black of his robes to the snowy white of the rice in a porcelain bowl, pale yellow and greens of the tea in the pot, golden honey brown of a fried pastry peeking out of a wrapped paper towel.</p><p>Saying nothing of the momentary vulnerability he had displayed during Xin Mo's backlash, Luo Binghe comes in every few shichen during the day, bringing along with him different colours when Shen Qingqiu refuses to eat and he cooks some other dishes that he knows are Shen Qingqiu’s favourites. Reds of the chilli spices kneaded into the noodles, dark browns of the sauce drizzled atop the side dishes and lighter browns of the soup in a separate porcelain bowl.</p><p>Rinse, wash and repeat.</p><p>For the entirety of the next few days of Shen Qingqiu’s imprisonment in Huan Hua Palace’s Water Prison, he doesn’t do anything else other than very reluctantly rejecting Binghe’s food, and convincing himself, in those few shichen when Binghe’s left to cook more food, that he shouldn’t trade his dignity for said food which also happened to be ridiculously delicious, no matter how badly he’s been starving.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu, regardless of whether it’s the original goods or the fake that had replaced him in a qi deviation sometimes back, would never willingly lower himself to such a state. If it were the him pre-transmigration, he would already have caved and eaten Binghe’s congee on day one. </p><p>Who cares if he had to eat it off the ground? Waste not, want not, right? He had died originally because he’d eaten expired yoghurt, eating Binghe’s cooking off the ground couldn’t possibly be any more humiliating than that!</p><p>Unfortunately, he has long since abandoned his identity of his previous life; Shen Yuan might not have any dignity, but Shen Qingqiu certainly did, which also meant he couldn’t just casually submit.</p><p>And anyway, Shen Qingqiu was still feeling relatively fine for now. Aside from the low, constant ache in his head and the weakness he feels in his lower limbs, Shen Qingqiu has long gotten used to the hunger.</p><p>Maybe when he feels like he can’t endure the hunger any longer, then that’s when Shen Qingqiu would have to give up on protecting his dignity. But even then, it still wasn’t too bad! It basically just meant Shen Qingqiu had bravely and heroically withstood the hunger pangs until he was no longer able to. That wasn’t humiliating in any way, right?! That’s how the suffering of the tragic characters in cliche storylines works!</p><p>Yes, Shen Qingqiu thinks, feeling slightly proud of himself. That’s a fool-proof plan.</p><p>Now… How to get Binghe to give up for the day?</p><p>This really wasn’t healthy; Binghe must have been spending these entire few days flitting about busily in Huan Hua Palace’s kitchen, doing nothing but preparing different sorts of dishes and pastries, brewing different blends of teas (which suspiciously also happens to be all of his favourites) while ignoring his other duties. </p><p>Shen Qingqiu frowns; why was Binghe so insistent on this form of humiliation? Isn’t this much more trouble than it’s worth? </p><p>And isn’t he the head disciple of Huan Hua Palace? Shen Qingqiu is pretty sure that head disciples aren’t usually so free!</p><p>Plus… cooking for him like that every shichen… isn’t that wasting a lot of food? Binghe, haven’t you cleared out the kitchen’s supplies by now? What are you going to do with all these leftovers?</p><p>Shen Qingqiu needs a plan.</p><p>Maybe he could try convincing Binghe he’s on a diet? Would that work? It’s like intermittent fasting, but the xianxia version of it, so it lasts for a few days instead of hours. That works, right?</p><p>Yeah, maybe he’ll give it a try!</p><hr/><p>It works, but not in the way Shen Qingqiu expects.</p><p>As per usual, their conversations are filled with snarky jabs and bitter, self-deprecating laughs from Luo Binghe, as well as clipped replies from Shen Qingqiu.</p><p>This time, though, Luo Binghe’s patience snaps at Shen Qingqiu’s horrendously poor attempt in trying to convince him. He throws a temper tantrum similar to the one Shen Qingqiu had witnessed on his first day of captivity.</p><p>“Coming up with this farce,” Luo Binghe had seethed in anger. “Shizun really does take me for a fool!”</p><p>“Binghe,” Shen Qingqiu starts, faltering. “That… isn’t what this master is trying to imply. This master will not be eating Binghe’s cooking regardless of what Binghe cooks, so this master figured that Binghe would be… better off fulfilling his other tasks instead. Doesn’t Binghe have many things to do? Shizun has heard that you’re now an important member of Huan Hua Sect.”</p><p>Luo Binghe stiffens, and looks at Shen Qingqiu as if he had just told him the one thing he didn’t want to hear. “Serving Shizun is part of my task as your disciple as well,” he says rigidly, forcing the words past his lips. “Is Shizun no longer willing to recognise me as your disciple?”</p><p>Shen Qingqiu raises a brow. “If Binghe is still willing to refer to this master as Shizun, then naturally this master will also recognise Binghe as a disciple of Qing Jing Peak. Yet, Binghe seems to have settled comfortably in Huan Hua Sect and has gained the trust of the palace master.” </p><p>Desperately wishing he had a fan to hide the lower half of his face with, Shen Qingqiu does his utmost to school his expression. He wonders if Binghe is able to see through his mask of nonchalance, and realise that underneath all that regal aloofness and indifference the Qing Jing Peak Lord portrayed was a man jittery from nervousness and fear. “Considering the circumstances, pardon if this master is hard-pressed to believe that Binghe’s allegiance lies with Huan Hua instead.” </p><p>His tremor of fear gives way to a more pressing emotion when he thinks about what he’s going to say next. It comes in like a flood; raw and painful, a harsh twist at his heart. Swallowing past the lump in his throat, he forces himself to continue. “And… And if that’s true… If Binghe wishes for it, then this master would no longer be considered—”</p><p>He doesn’t manage to finish his sentence. </p><p>“—<em>No</em>.” Luo Binghe interrupts darkly. “Shizun is Shizun, no matter what.”</p><p>Shen Qingqiu’s throat clams up, and whatever words he had been planning to say immediately dies at the tip of his tongue. </p><p>It’s… fine by him either way. In the first place, those were words he hadn’t really wanted to say, couldn't really bring himself to. Flimsy and problematic as their relationship was —being fuelled with hatred, rage, and guilt— it was still the only thing left between them tying them together. Cutting this tie between them— Shen Qingqiu finds himself unable to do such a thing.</p><p>Luo Binghe’s lips crack into a wry smile. “Shizun can’t get rid of me, if that’s what Shizun’s been hoping. This disciple won’t let Shizun go.”</p><p>Shen Qingqiu feels a shudder run up his spine, and the entire atmosphere turns heavy. The fear returns with a vengeance and sinks heavily deep in his gut. </p><p>As expected, the blackened protagonist Luo Binghe would never let him off that easily, after everything he’s done. He’ll keep him captive here, toy with his mind, and cajole him with sweet words. </p><p>Mislead him with unshed tears, with deliberate words trembling with layers of false sadness, with anguished rage fuelling his harsh words, all to lower his guard.</p><p>Of course. Binghe would never give up this relationship between them so easily. After all, it had been his shizun that stabbed him, his shizun that had pushed him into the abyss, his <em> shizun </em>who had mercilessly broke his heart.</p><p>Then, naturally, Shen Qingqiu should pay the price as Binghe’s Shizun. It would be unfair to Binghe if Shen Qingqiu discarded that label and the responsibility that he has to bear along with it. </p><p>“Fine. Binghe can call this master whatever he wants,” Shen Qingqiu concedes tiredly, fear giving way to sheer exhaustion. He can feel his headache worsening, and the coldness of the water prison is starting to seep into his bones, chilling him at his core, but he’s left helpless and defenseless to the harshness of the environment. He hasn’t felt this awful in ages, and it brings back flashes of buried memories from his past.</p><p>“But Huan Hua’s palace master and the rest of Cang Qiong Peak Lords might not be so understanding. It is… unheard of for someone to belong in two different sects at once,” he explains hesitatingly.</p><p>Binghe clicks his tongue in annoyance, and his demonic energy pulses threateningly. “They can disapprove all they want, their opinion hardly matters,” he snorts. “As long as they don’t stand in my way to Shizun, this disciple does not care what others think.”</p><p>It’s a bold claim to make, but it’s fitting for the blackened Luo Binghe who had crawled out of the abyss fuelled by hate and anger at the entire world and his circumstances. Why was it that others could live so freely and happily, had everything they wanted and needed served to them on a silver platter, while he had to struggle and beg and fight so desperately just so he could live?</p><p>Why is it that even in the end, the one person who had accepted him and lovingly gave him a home, the only person other than his adoptive mother to have loved him, raised him, cared for him, taught him how to live, protected him as if he were a precious thing—</p><p>—Why did even that person throw him away? Why was he discarded so easily, just like that?</p><p>Had everything he felt, the tender gazes he’d seen, the lingering warmth from the familial loving touches against his skin and the pleasant press of a palm against his scalp, ruffling his hair—</p><p>Had they all been a lie?</p><p>Luo Binghe falls silent, and Shen Qingqiu shifts his gaze away.</p><p>The memories of a kinder and much brighter past consumes them. It wraps around them, like a soothing balm, like a knife to the heart. It’s ironic how the memories of their happier times cuts like broken glass shards, yet it is in the wake of these that they are able to find their little crumbs of solace.</p><p>Their conversation grinds to a halt, and falls apart.</p><p>This pattern is nothing new between them as of late.</p><p>Afterall, hasn’t the relationship between them turned out the exact same?</p><hr/><p>One week into his captivity, Shen Qingqiu wakes up feeling like absolute shit.</p><p>There’s a familiar burn in his lungs and he comes up short of breath. By this time, Shen Qingqiu knows what exactly is happening even before he is acutely aware of his symptoms. </p><p>Wryly, Shen Qingqiu smiles. It’s good enough, he finds himself thinking. It’d been a good, long six years, and every single day had been a day stolen from a man of this world, for a man of another who had died miserably six years back. </p><p>Even in the millionth chances that their plan failed, it still really wasn’t much of a loss. In fact, he’d gained six years worth of treasured memories and cherished bonds with his precious people, and lost absolutely nothing in return for this piece of treasure he’s received.</p><p>Seemingly unbothered in the slightest, Shen Qingqiu shifts his attention back to Binghe, who is kneeling patiently before him, waiting for him to wake fully. As per usual, there’s a tray of food settled before him, with another plate of pastries and a pot of tea. Only this time, there’s a small basin of water sitting besides the tray and a clean white cloth folded neatly next to it.</p><p>“Good morning, Shizun,” Binghe greets. His tone is warm, and he smiles as if the previous few days’ incidents had never happened at all. It’s slightly unsettling, but Shen Qingqiu finds that he’s starting to get used to Binghe’s constant ire hidden behind false smiles.</p><p>“Good morning, Binghe,” he greets amiably, before sighing. “I’ve already told you, this master isn’t planning to eat. There’s no need for Binghe to go to such lengths to prepare such…” Here, Shen Qingqiu eyes darts to the five different dishes plated out onto the tray, truly a meal fit for a king. “... extravagant meals.”</p><p>“Shizun naturally deserves only the best,” Binghe refutes cheerfully. “And it has already been a week, Shizun should eat,” he insists. Binghe’s lighthearted demeanor only makes him seem like he’s on the verge of snapping anytime, and Shen Qingqiu wonders if Binghe’s pent-up frustration was due to his repeated uncooperativeness over the past few days.</p><p>In fact, all things considered, he was pretty surprised Luo Binghe hasn't actually ripped off his limbs yet, but he sure wasn’t about to complain. He’s almost certain Binghe will eventually turn him into a human stick and exact his revenge once he decides he’s done humiliating Shen Qingqiu, but until then, Shen Qingqiu will most certainly try his best to preserve his measly life.</p><p>Too caught up in his thoughts, Shen Qingqiu doesn’t notice the series of action the blackened protagonist takes— reaching out for the cloth, dipping it in the basin of water, wringing it dry— all the while humming an upbeat tune.</p><p>When he <em> does </em>realise it, Binghe has already shifted himself closer on his knees, leaning closely over him. The tip of Binghe’s finger brushes across his bound arm, and before Binghe can even attempt to hold Shen Qingqiu steady enough to wipe him off with the wet cloth, the close proximity of their bodies, the smallest touch against his skin, against his robes—</p><p>—it feels like a blazing trail fire dancing across his skin, and the sheer panic and fear that surges within Shen Qingqiu is enough to shatter his mask of forced aloofness and calm.</p><p>He flinches.</p><p>Binghe immediately freezes, the arm holding the cloth stilling in the air, his other hand hovering over Shen Qingqiu’s bound arm where his fingers had brushed across earlier. He doesn’t move a muscle, eyes flitting down to gaze at Shen Qingqiu. </p><p>Then, he lowers his arms, and sinks into his kneel. His actions are stilted and tense. “...Did Shizun think I was going to hurt him?” His voice comes out soft, barely a whisper.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu’s mouth is dry, his heart hammering in his ears. “N-no,” he denies weakly. “This master was just… surprised.”</p><p>Luo Binghe stays silent for a moment or two. Then, he exhales through his nose, and laughs, long and slow. </p><p>“Of course. This disciple has overstepped his boundaries,” he says, still chuckling. It sounds raw and bitter, and Shen Qingqiu thinks belatedly that he has been making Binghe do a lot of that, recently. </p><p>Bitter laughs, mocking smiles and soft, sad whispers. </p><p>“Is Shizun afraid of me?” He asks, when his laughter finally dies out. The demonic energy pulses in tandem to his rising anger, and it cloaks and settles densely on his skin. The sigil of the heavenly demon glows a burning red on his forehead.</p><p>Luo Binghe smiles, lips curling over pearly white teeth. It’s chillier and frostier than all his other smiles combined. “But this disciple hasn’t even done anything yet? Would Shizun like me to, since he believes this disciple likes to inflict pain?”</p><p>He folds his hands across his lap, and Shen Qingqiu immediately panics.</p><p><em> Abort mission, abort mission, abortabortabort</em>—</p><p>—Luo Binghe snaps. </p><p>It starts off as a mild burning pooling in his gut, and it spreads thickly, heat blossoming from under his skin. It dances like fire across his veins, setting his nerves aflame with every itch and painful crawl of his blood. Shen Qingqiu lets out a choked gasp, tears immediately springing to his eyes.</p><p>He’s unable to hold himself upright from the sheer pain that surges from within, and Luo Binghe reaches his hands out to steady him, gingerly pressing his palms against Shen Qingqiu’s shoulders. Then he tilts Shen Qingqiu forward, so that his head is resting in the crook of his shoulder, and his entire weight is supported by Binghe’s sturdy frame.</p><p>“Steady there now,” Binghe hums, patting at Shen Qingqiu’s back soothingly. “Shizun can lean on this disciple if need be. The blood parasites must hurt quite badly, after all.”</p><p>Shen Qingqiu grits his teeth, too overcome by pain to even complain about the position they’re in, or the twisted irony of Luo Binghe’s actions. The blood parasites, under Binghe’s ministrations, burns and nips painfully at his organs, twists viciously in his veins.</p><p><em> System!!! </em> He calls desperately in his mind. <em> Do something!!! </em></p><p>The accursed system whirls to life, and in his haze of pain, Shen Qingqiu barely hears the system respond cheerfully in his haze of pain.</p><p>
<b> <em>[System is here to provide host with 24/7 service! Does host require any assistance?]</em> </b>
</p><p><em> What do you think?!!??!?! </em>Shen Qingqiu roars internally, too overcome by pain to even bother with pleasantries.</p><p>
<b> <em>[  Σ(゜ロ゜;)  ]</em> </b>
</p><p>Then, the system seemingly scrambles away, and in its place, a loading circle takes over. A few seconds later, the blue box of the system pops back up.</p><p>
<b> <em>[Answering host, Luo Binghe’s anger level is only at 30 points! According to system’s calculations, Luo Binghe is only teasing you with his blood parasites, and will stop in a few minutes!]</em> </b>
</p><p>
<b> <em>[Just tough it out, host! (*＾∀ﾟ )ъ ]</em> </b>
</p><p>With that, the useless system disappears, and Shen Qingqiu is so incensed by the sheer audacity of the sorry excuse of his system (who even gave him a thumbs-up! A <em> thumbs-up!!</em>) that he thinks he would have qi-deviated if it weren’t for the immortal binding cables blocking his meridians.</p><p>But seriously, only 30 points? And this was just him being playful?!</p><p>Shen Qingqiu didn’t want to imagine a truly livid Binghe.</p><p>Accepting his fate and giving in to the pain, Shen Qingqiu buries his head in Binghe’s shoulder— anything to distract him from the burning flame in his blood and the flares of pain blooming under his skin. His breath comes out in short pants, ghosting lightly over the skin of Binghe’s collarbone.</p><p>Luo Binghe chuckles lowly. </p><p>“The pain actually isn’t too bad, isn’t it, Shizun?” Binghe sounds darkly amused, voice coming out a low, smooth rumble next to Shen Qingqiu’s ears. “Where else would Shizun like it to hurt? Should this disciple command the blood parasites to start biting?”</p><p>Then, Luo Binghe lets out a sound, eyes flickering with understanding. “Ah,” he says. “Maybe here?”</p><p>Shen Qingqiu bites at his lips, muffling a pained groan as Binghe directs the blood parasites up to gnaw at his chest without even waiting for a reply. At the exact same spot where he had thrust Xiu Ya into Binghe’s chest— it’s a wrenching pain that leaves him stuttering for breath.</p><p>“Does it hurt, Shizun?” Luo Binghe asks. “It does, doesn’t it? Of course it does. It hurt the same for me back then as well.”</p><p>Leaning heavily and quite literally caged in the arms of the blackened protagonist, Shen Qingqiu is able to feel the reverberations in Binghe’s chest as he chuckles, the warm puff of breath and lips murmuring over his ears, the soothing press of a warm palm against the back of his head, pushing him comfortingly into the crook of Binghe’s shoulder.</p><p>The blood parasites feel like they’re rioting at his chest; sharp, stabbing flares of pain and a searing heat burning torturously at his heart. Shen Qingqiu bites at his lips so hard he draws blood. </p><p>“Shizun is afraid of me, isn’t that right? Afraid that this disciple is a monster? That I’ll hurt you, just like this?” Binghe lets out a huff, and there’s a teasing lilt to his tone. “Well, Shizun is right. After all, look at what this disciple is doing, inflicting pain on his dearest Shizun. But isn’t Shizun at fault as well? Since Shizun believes his disciple to be so, then naturally this disciple must live up to his expectations, don’t you think?”</p><p>Shen Qingqiu is near tears. His shoulders tremble underneath Binghe’s hand, and each inhale of breath sends a spike of pain through his nerves. Really, how is this ‘only teasing’??!?! System, are you mad??!?!??</p><p>Binghe smiles wryly. “This disciple didn't want to use this method, but it seems like it works well to be a monster. When Shizun is scared and hurting like this, he will be a lot more obedient, won’t he?”</p><p>Then, he lets up the blood parasites, and despite how much his words sound like a threat, Shen Qingqiu is unable to help the relieved sigh that escapes his lips when the burn under his skin and searing pain slowly dissipates.</p><p>His relief doesn’t last for long, though. The initial burn in his lungs he’d woken up with comes back with a vengeance now that he’s no longer distracted by the blood parasites, and this time, a wave of nausea accompanies it.</p><p>Weakly, he lifts his head off Binghe’s broad shoulder in an attempt to sit himself upright. It’s much harder than he expects, too weak from the combined forces of the blood parasites and the burning in his lungs.</p><p>Vision blacking out for a split second, Shen Qingqiu sways precariously— only to be caught mid-fall by a gentle hand from Binghe, who gingerly picks him up, and leans him against a nearby wall.</p><p>Then, Binghe picks up the napkin, dips it carefully in the basin of water, and wrings it dry. “Be good now,” he murmurs lowly.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu is too weak to even lift a finger, let alone protest. He lets Binghe do as he pleases; tenderly wiping his sweat and grime off in focused silence, dipping the cloth back into the basin every few minutes. The cloth feels damp and comfortably lukewarm against his skin.</p><p>In the aftermath of pain, Shen Qingqiu finds himself increasingly aware of Binghe’s every action, every brush of his fingers across his skin, the soft caress at his neck. </p><p>How he gently slides the cloth across his shoulders, down his arms, around his wrists.</p><p>Kneads at his palm when he reaches his hand, wipes gingerly at the corners in between his fingers. </p><p>Rubs tenderly at every nook and cranny— in the crook of his elbow, the dip in his collarbone, behind his ear. Across the bare skin of his nape, down his neck, soft flesh giving way to each press of his fingers against bare skin.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu shivers.</p><p>The entire process and Shen Qingqiu’s quiet acquiescence seemingly lifts Luo Binghe’s mood, who takes his time with his careful touches; kneading the muscles at Shen Qingqiu’s back, rubbing gently at the flesh of his palm and fingers, pressing and loosening the taut muscles that had formed over his time being tied up by the cables while also taking care to wipe the dirt and grime away.</p><p>After a long while, Shen Qingqiu’s body feels loose and relaxed, and seeing this, Luo Binghe eventually releases Shen Qingqiu with a pleased, satisfied hum. Seemingly in a better mood after having touched and served his Shizun properly for an extended period of time, Luo Binghe’s cold fury is no longer as suffocating as it previously had been.</p><p>Despite this, Shen Qingqiu obediently remains silent in fear of triggering the protagonist’s ire again, watching him with a careful eye.</p><p>Binghe folds the cloth and sets it back down besides the basin of water. Then, he turns towards the tray of food, picks up the spoon, and proceeds to skim the top layer of the congee with it. Then, with a pair of chopsticks, he gingerly places a small strip of chicken drizzled golden brown onto the spoon, and hovers it in front of Shen Qingqiu’s lips.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu, in his weakened state, almost goes cross-eyed, mind reeling in shock.</p><p>What.... What was this?!?!</p><p>I-Is Binghe s-spoonfeeding him?! </p><p>Never mind wiping him off like some lowly servant, was Luo Binghe, the stallion protagonist, <em> spoon-feeding </em>him lovingly as if he was one of his 600 wives in his harem?!</p><p>“W-What... is the meaning of this?” He manages to croak out, eyes transfixed onto the spoon held before his lips.</p><p>Luo Binghe smiles sardonically, his spoon lowering. “Is Shizun going to put up a fight again?” He asks with a heavy undercurrent of threat.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu feels another wave of fear course through his veins. “No,” he immediately denies, unwilling to go through another round of the blood parasites wreaking havoc in his body. “But this…?” </p><p>Binghe blinks. </p><p>"How else did Shizun plan to eat?" He questions back. Now he sounds slightly amused, and his smile comes off marginally lighter— and realer. "Did Shizun assume this disciple would make him eat it off the ground?" He teases. </p><p>Shen Qingqiu stays silent.</p><p>Yes, yes he did!! How was he supposed to think otherwise; wasn’t Binghe supposed to torture him, humiliate him and visciously turn him into a human stick?! Why would Binghe lovingly spoon-feed him instead?!??</p><p>“Nonsense,” he refutes almost immediately in an attempt to save face, brows twitching. </p><p>Binghe smiles indulgently, and lifts the spoon up to nudge at Shen Qingqiu’s lips. “Then, Shizun won’t refuse the food this time, right? Be good now, you know this disciple has other ways to make Shizun eat.”</p><p>A shiver crawls up his spine at Binghe’s foreboding words, and Shen Qingqiu eyes at the spoon skeptically.</p><p>Well, if he didn’t have to eat it off the ground…</p><p>Rigidly, Shen Qingqiu complies; obediently parting his lips to accept the spoonful of congee.</p><p>The congee spreads warm and flavourful in his mouth, and together with the finely sliced chicken, it tastes exactly the same as it did those many years ago, before he had pushed Binghe down the abyss. Lusciously rich and savoury as it melts on his tongue, thick and smooth as it slides down his throat. A faint sweet aftertaste lingering on the tip of his tongue.</p><p>It’s a nostalgic flavour.</p><p>Distractedly, he wonders if Binghe had never meant for him to eat his food off the ground. Perhaps… Perhaps, Binghe had intended to spoon-feed him like this from the start? </p><p>Is this another weird sort of humiliation play Shen Qingqiu didn’t know about?? Why would Binghe even go through the trouble to do something like this? </p><p>Or maybe this was Binghe’s method of stripping away all of Shen Qingqiu’s autonomy? To humiliate him by leaving him helpless and completely at Binghe’s mercy for his survival, like a treasured doll kept in doll houses.</p><p>Well, whether it's with the intent of humiliating him or not, this was still a far better option than eating it off the ground, Shen Qingqiu decides. It’s not like Binghe didn’t hand feed him sweets back then before the Immortal Alliance Conference, especially during the times Shen Qingqiu had been preoccupied reading texts on demonic beasts and hadn’t wanted to dirty those precious books— even though Binghe had been a stuttering and bumbling mess back then.</p><p>Lost in his thoughts, Shen Qingqiu doesn’t notice how Binghe watches his every action; the way his lips slide over the spoon, the way he chews slowly and carefully as if savouring the taste of the congee, the way his throat bobs daintily when he swallows it.</p><p>Binghe lifts another spoonful of the congee, watching intently with a burning gaze when Shen Qingqiu, still distracted, compliantly leans forward to accept the spoonful again. </p><p>They spend a long while sitting in the water prison like this, with Binghe gingerly spoon-feeding him the congee and the side dishes, and Shen Qingqiu, in a manner reminiscent to his previous spoiled attitude with a white lotus Luo Binghe, eating the dishes off Binghe’s hand.</p><p>Binghe’s actions are slow and unhurried, indulgent in the way he waits for Shen Qingqiu to finish chewing every mouthful and every little bite he places into his mouth. He spoons only a small amount, and only the top layer of the congee where it’s warm and no longer scalding hot, and carefully tops every spoonful with a small portion of a side dish; braised chicken strips, succulent and tender chilli prawns, crisply fried tofu sprinkled with sesame seeds.</p><p>He dabs at the corner of Shen Qingqiu’s lips indulgently with a clean napkin from his inner robes when a smear of the sauce stains Shen Qingqiu’s lower lip, rubbing at it gently before feeding him another mouthful.</p><p>He waits patiently as Shen Qingqiu chews, rubs at his lips with the napkin and his thumb every so often in between mouthfuls. Alternates the spoonful of congee with sips of tea, and when Shen Qingqiu has cleaned out the entire bowl, he picks up the pastry— a fluffy white cotton-like dragonbeard candy— with his fingers, and brings it to Shen Qingqiu’s lips, eyes darkening when Shen Qingqiu eats the pastry off Binghe’s fingers with no qualms, tongue brushing against the tip of his fingers.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu’s eyes brighten when the candy melts on his tongue, the soft, fluffy strands of spun sugar giving way and coating the peanut filling. He eats the next candy off Binghe’s fingers eagerly, and finishes the rest speedily.</p><p>Binghe chuckles, and rubs at Shen Qingqiu’s lower lip with his thumb, brushing off the half-dissolved flyaway strands of the candy. “Looks like Shizun enjoyed the pastries?” He teases knowingly.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu coughs, and forces down a blush. “It was acceptable,” he answers evasively, but Binghe, who is aware of his Shizun’s exceedingly thin-face, knows that it is akin to a compliment. </p><p>His lips curve up into a smile, and he lifts the cup of tea again to Shen Qingqiu’s lips, watching as the Qing Jing Peak Lord took leisurely sips of the warm tea, throat bobbing as he swallows. The heat of the tea brings a warm flush to Shen Qingqiu’s cheeks, and Luo Binghe finds himself content just staring at the image of Shen Qingqiu paints; compliant and comfortable under Luo Binghe’s care.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu eventually finishes the tea, and Luo Binghe settles the teacup back onto the tray, along with the other empty plates and bowls. “This disciple will bring over more pastries tomorrow,” Binghe says indulgently. “What would Shizun like to have?”</p><p>Shen Qingqiu pauses in contemplation, before replying, “...hard candy?”</p><p>“Then this disciple will bring over some hard candies tomorrow. Shizun may look forward to it,” Binghe smiles. Then, he stands up, and leans over to scoop Shen Qingqiu back into his arms, tilting him so that he falls securely against his chest, tucked tightly within his arms.</p><p>Of course, he doesn’t miss how Shen Qingqiu’s eyes widen slightly in fear and how stiff he becomes when trapped within his embrace, but there’s also a flustered blush that spreads across Shen Qingqiu’s cheeks— pretty and pink against the pale shades of his skin.</p><p>“Pardon this one for his impropriety,” he murmurs unapologetically, completely ignoring the protests that spill out of Shen Qingqiu’s lips. Shen Qingqiu weighs almost close to nothing in his arms, all lithe with lean, toned muscles. Bound with his arms behind his back and stripped of his cultivation, the resistance Shen Qingqiu puts up is akin to that of a new-born kitten pawing at his chest. </p><p>Luo Binghe feels a complicated feeling rise up in his chest— he’s strong enough now to care for his Shizun and attend to his every need, strong enough now that he could successfully twist Huan Hua Sect under his scheme, strong enough to keep Shen Qingqiu in his grasp. Yet it feels even lonelier now that he has Shen Qingqiu by his side, when his every action is met with apprehension and fear.</p><p>He strides over to the stone platform with Shen Qingqiu bundled in his arms, and sets him down in the middle of it— where he’d originally been.</p><p>Now seated on the stone platform, Shen Qingqiu is still staring at him, completely befuddled. Luo Binghe can’t help but feel his heart twist faintly at the sight of his Shizun before him— imprisoned, bound, helpless with his guard down after how he had let Luo binghe tend to him so carefully after so many days of insistent protests. </p><p>The guilt wells up in his heart, and it’s a suffocating pressure that chokes him and renders him unable to speak.  </p><p>Maybe Shen Qingqiu had been right all along— that Luo Binghe is a despicable demon who belongs in the depths of hell, that he had been right to have feared him for the demon that he is, had been right to push him into the abyss where he truly belongs.</p><p>After all, inflicting pain onto his Shizun, forcing him to comply against his wishes… </p><p>Isn’t he acting exactly like how Shizun had predicted him to be?</p><hr/><p>Later that night, Shen Qingqiu wakes with a painful throb in his temple. His breath comes out weakly in short, shallow puffs— the cold prison air is an icy burn in his lungs, and it forces out a cough whenever he breathes any deeper than the shallow intakes of air that seemingly feels just <em> almost </em>never enough to fill his lungs. His arms are still bound painfully behind his back, and the ropes dig painfully into his skin, chafing it red and raw.</p><p>He wakes up to a tremble in his limbs from the constant kneeling over the previous few days, and a weary ache deep in his bones, with the remnant tingling of his blood smoldering just beneath his skin— a reminder of the blood parasites crawling within his body.</p><p>He wakes up to cold water splashed unceremoniously onto his face, drenching his robes and wetting his hair. It jolts him awake, and makes him feel the entirety of his weakened state. </p><p>Shen Qingqiu stifles down a cough. It takes him a while for his body’s physical function to catch up with his mind, and he has to blink several times to rid himself of the droplets of water sitting on his lashes and blurring his vision.</p><p>The little palace mistress is standing in front of him, a hand placed haughtily on her hip. In her other hand, there’s an empty basin with droplets of water dripping onto the ground. A familiar scowl is etched onto her face, the same disdainful look he’s been seeing on all the other disciples of Huan Hua Palace when they notice his presence— at Jinlan City’s inn, at Huan Hua’s palace when his name was smeared, while escorting him to the water prison.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu lets out an indignant huff, feeling slightly like a drowned, miserable cat. His temple throbs mercilessly when he focuses his gaze on the little palace mistress, and the wind that trails in from the opening of the caves feels like a harsh, biting cold against his wet skin and damp robes.</p><p>Then, he frowns.</p><p>Weren’t everyone else, minus Binghe, barred from entry into the water prison?</p><p>What was the little Palace Mistress doing here?</p><p>“Finally awake?” The Little Palace Mistress sneers down at him. “Being able to sleep so peacefully in this condition, Shen Qingqiu, aren’t you acting a little too carefree for a criminal living out his numbered days?”</p><p>…</p><p>You’re kidding.</p><p>The little Palace mistress really broke the rules, came all the way down to this god-forsaken caves, just to ‘bully’ a mere prisoner?! Just exactly how free were Huan Hua disciples?!</p><p>“...Good morning to you as well, Little Palace Mistress,” Shen Qingqiu greets tiredly, ignoring how the cold basin water dumped unceremoniously atop his head trickles down his neck and soaks the upper half of his robes. His hair plasters wetly onto his face, and Shen Qingqiu has to blink away a droplet of water trickling into the corner of his eyes. “The trial has yet to be held, what makes Little Palace Mistress so sure that this one will be found guilty?”</p><p>His words are simple, direct and innocuous in nature, but the little palace mistress bristles in anger regardless. She puffs up angrily, cheeks reddening. “Cut the crap! Don’t think we’re unaware of your crimes and wrongdoings, and the things you did to Luo-gege! It’s only a matter of time before you meet your end, Shen Qingqiu!”</p><p>Amazingly enough, the little palace mistress’ angry tirade sounds exactly like the speech of a cannon fodder villain that Shen Qingqiu almost does a double-take. Little Palace Mistress, aren’t you supposed to be the protagonist’s wife? Why are you following a villain’s script?!</p><p>“This isn’t something the little palace mistress should be concerned about,” Shen Qingqiu eventually replies. As expected, this entire ‘visit’ was to take revenge for Binghe. Little girls sure are aggressive nowadays, Shen Qingqiu marvels. </p><p>“And this is neither the place for you to be in, isn’t that right, Little Palace Mistress?” he asks knowingly, with a raised brow.  Besides, a little girl like her, with barely any cultivation prowess or standing, interrogating a peak lord is really quite an audacious act in itself. Are kids nowadays all so brazen? </p><p>“That is none of your concern,” the Little Palace Mistress replies arrogantly, tilting her chin up and crossing her arms with a scowl. “I can go wherever I want to; my father is the head of Huan Hua, I’ll see who dares to stop me!”</p><p>Shen Qingqiu barely manages to refrain from sighing. It’s not at all surprising that the treasured daughter of Lao Gongzhu had grown up so spoiled. Huan Hua Sect is as influential as their reputation precedes, and their wealth far outclasses most ordinary sects by no small amount. With her father as sect leader, who would dare to stop her?</p><p>“Then, this one is naturally curious as to why Little Palace Mistress has deigned to visit. I don’t believe we’re acquainted enough to warrant such a joyful... chat.”</p><p>The Little Palace Mistress scoffs. “Luo-gege is too nice,” she begins, “he isn’t willing to lay a hand on you for the mistreatment and abuse you’ve subjected him to, and he doesn’t say a single word about it. Look at you, still acting as if you’ve done nothing wrong at all, Shen Qingqiu, have you no shame?”</p><p>Shen Qingqiu blinks, momentarily stupefied.</p><p>Abuse? Mistreatment? </p><p>That sheer audacity—!</p><p>—Asides from pushing Binghe down the abyss, from the day he transmigrated up until the Immortal Alliance Conference, Shen Qingqiu had never once mistreated the protagonist. In fact, he’d quite literally coddled and mother-henned Binghe until he turned into something like a sticky rice cake and clinged onto him constantly! Binghe sure had some guts to imply that he had been mistreated— Shen Qingqiu would like to file a complaint!!</p><p>And the protagonist halo truly is a scary thing!! </p><p>Binghe didn’t even have to say anything— Shen Qingqiu’s name has already been smeared so thoroughly and effortlessly that the little palace mistress was even willing to break into the water prison for Luo Binghe’s sake!! All Binghe had to do was to stay silent and let the Huan Hua disciples make their own assumptions!</p><p>After all, for a disciple to be unwilling to return to the sect that he’d initially belonged in, there were only a few plausible reasons, and none of them painted Shen Qingqiu in a good light.</p><p>And the truth— that Luo Binghe is of the heavenly demon bloodline and that Shen Qingqiu had been forced by a mysterious god-like entity known as the system to push Luo Binghe down the abyss or face a permanent termination from life itself— is so much more far-fetched and ridiculous than the lies that has been spreading that it’s practically impossible for anyone to even consider such a scenario to be possible.</p><p>“Shen Qingqiu, do you dare say your hands are clean? Do you dare say you are not guilty?” The Little Palace mistress sneers down at him, and Shen Qingqiu jerks out of his thoughts.</p><p>Clean?</p><p>No.</p><p>Not at all, he thinks. His blade has tasted the flesh of his disciple, his hands stained with the blood of a person who adored him with every fibre of their being. How could he be clean?</p><p>Shen Qingqiu <em> is </em>guilty.</p><p>So, he keeps his lips sealed firmly shut, and stays silent under the Little Palace Mistress’ overbearing gaze. </p><p>“You think just by staying silent, you can pretend you’ve never hurt Luo-gege? That you’ve never been heartless and viscious, that you’ve never done anything wrong?” The Little Palace Mistress seethes. “You think just by staying silent, you can get away with doing evil deeds without getting retribution?! You’ve colluded with the demons, your hands are stained with the blood of thousands! In the Immortal Alliance Conference, my sect’s disciples... My shijie, my shixiong, shidi, shimei— all of them! They all died by your hands!”</p><p>The Little Palace Mistress stops abruptly, and lets out a short, cold laugh. Her voice comes out breathless and airy from the intense outpour of emotions.</p><p>“Shen Qingqiu,” she warns, brandishing a barbed whip from thin air. It glows a dull gold besides her, pulsing heavily with spiritual power. “Just because Luo-gege can’t bear to hurt you, that doesn’t mean the other Huan Hua disciples won’t.” </p><p>Here, she reaches out to tug harshly at the back of his hair, pulling painfully at his scalp. The sheer force of the hair-grabbing lifts him slightly off his knees, and Shen Qingqiu, ill and defenseless, is left unable to defend himself. </p><p>The Little Palace Mistress’ face is mere inches away from his, and she has a sickly sweet smile etched on her face. “You deserve this, Shen Qingqiu,” she says, almost kindly, peering down at him from underneath her lashes. Her words resonate hauntingly within the depths of his mind, and Shen Qingqiu…</p><p>Shen Qingqiu closes his eyes.</p><p>
<em> He does. </em>

<p>When he was still Shen Yuan, he had been sick.</p><p>Back then, the place most familiar to him hadn’t been his home.</p><p>It hadn’t been his pre-school, or the playground just a few streets down the city. It hadn’t been by his siblings’ side, where they’d laugh and play and tousle about on the cool ceramic tiles of their apartment.</p><p>It hadn’t been within the arms of his parents’ comforting embrace after he’s had a particularly bad day, or when his illness flares painfully and he’s left struggling and retching in his own pool of vomit, sweat and tears.</p><p>From the tender age of nine, the place most familiar to him— the place he’d most frequently found himself in— had been the hospital.</p><p>He had spent the majority of his previous life as Shen Yuan cooped up in his hospital ward, surrounded by cold grey walls and the heavy smell of antiseptic. The doctors had told him then, that he had a higher order neurological dysfunction, that it was incurable, that his body was falling apart like broken clumps of dirt, like loose ashes scattered in the wind.</p><p>He’d be unable to lead a normal life, and with every ragged breath he takes, he would feel the entirety of the pain his illness brings in his every waking moment and every sleepless night. </p><p>Shen Yuan would have to struggle getting by everyday of his life until the day he dies.</p><p>When he falls asleep and wakes up the next day to the soft rays of the sun filtering through the windows of his hospital ward, warm like a soothing caress against his cheek, it is another day he has fought for, and another day he has managed to win. </p><p>And even if he manages to blearily blink his eyes open amidst all the pain his body is in, on most days, he’d still been immobilised in his hospital bed with a breathing tube stuck down his nose and airways, IV drips jabbed into his veins.</p><p>Shen Yuan is barely able to remember most of his sicker days— those few months prior to his transmigration before he’d passed away. He’d almost never been fully conscious, too overwhelmed by the pain that he usually just passes out, unable to hold on to even a silver of his consciousness. Like fine grains of sand sifting through his fingers, his last few days as Shen Yuan had passed him by in a flash; gone without him knowing, slipped out of his hands without him realising. </p><p>But on some better days, he’d been able to retain his consciousness. In those days when he’d been fully aware, he notices how devoid of colours the grey walls of his hospital rooms are, how devoid of life the antiseptic air smells. He notices the constant rhythmic beeping of the heart monitor beside him, and how deafening it seems to become after his gege and meimei leaves.</p><p>His only respite came in the form of his web-novels, where he’s transported to a world filled with life and bustling noises amidst splashes of bright colours, with passion-filled dreams and exhilarating adventures, with legendary pills and miraculous cures. </p><p>Cures that he’d spent many hours lying on his hospital bed fantasizing about— could they cure him of his illness? Could they magically fix whatever that was wrong with him somehow? Let him feel the cool breeze brushing against his cheek as he walks along the streets, feel the sweet mint burn in his lungs as he runs for the bus, feel what it's like to live ardently instead of lying in his bed waiting for his time to come?</p><p>But of course, when it came down to it, there wasn’t even really a need for a cure. </p><p>Transmigrated into the body of Shen Qingqiu, a peak lord with a healthy body and a cultivation strong enough to keep his previous sickly nature at bay, Shen Yuan finally experienced what it was like to live freely, unbounded by his frail body’s inhibitions. </p><p>As Shen Qingqiu, he had ample strength at his disposal, powerful enough to simply <em> live.  </em></p><p>He’s strong enough to just simply notice the wind tousling his hair when he goes through his sword forms, to relish in the rush of adrenaline and the thrumm of excitement coursing through his veins when he wields Xiu Ya. </p><p>He’s strong enough that he doesn't have to desperately try to catch his breath at the side of the streets when he walks for five minutes too long, strong enough that he doesn’t have to clutch desperately onto the handicap rails as he regurgitates his dinner and heaves blood into the lavatory in the middle of the night.</p><p>He’s strong enough— that he can even protect the people close to him and the things he’s slowly come to cherish over in his time living as Shen Qingqiu.</p><p>And now, even if it means reverting back to his weak old self, helpless and sickly, Shen Qingqiu would still gladly do it— has already done it. He has allowed them to take him prisoner, allowed them to bind him with a hundred and eight immortal binding cables, stripping him free of his cultivation and his qi, the only thing holding his illness from his time as Shen Yuan at bay. </p><p>And now, Shen Qingqiu is left defenseless to the onslaught of his illness that has crept up on him. It settles deeply within the depths of his body, makes itself a home with the blood and bones of a previously healthy man whose body he stole, whose body is now a mirror to his old.</p><p>But if it meant that all his other peak lord friends and his dear Qing Jing Peak could stay safe, Shen Qingqiu would gladly do it all over again. Would let his illness relapse with a vengeance, let it eat away at him from the inside— slowly, gradually, painfully.</p><p>If it meant that he could stay by Binghe’s side, to atone for the things he’s done, to be the catharsis to Binghe’s destructive anger and the man he’s become, Shen Qingqiu would gladly walk this path all over again, and accompany Binghe until he burns through the very last flicker of his life. </p><p>It wouldn’t be too bad, in all honesty. After all, Huan Hua’s water prison isn’t that much different from what he’s used to— a chamber of isolated silence and a world of grey. The waterfall is a rushing cascade; it hits the ground and flows into the lake, permeates through the cave in rhythmic, deafening beats.</p><p>It reminds him of the heart monitor he hears every night as Shen Yuan. It reminds him of the cold white, washed-out walls and deafening silence of the hospital.</p><p>Huan Hua’s water prison is a familiar sight, and a familiar sound.</p><p>It’s easy to get used to this.</p><p>After all, wasn’t the hospital he’d died in in his previous life like this, as well?</p><hr/><p>When Shen Qingqiu wakes up, it’s to a stabbing flare of pain in his stomach and a wave of nausea rolling in his gut. Every laboured breath that he takes comes out stifled and short, and when he blinks his eyes open, the vertigo that hits him feels like a truck to his face. </p><p>The entire world spins, and Shen Qingqiu snaps his eyelids shut.</p><p>It is difficult to breathe.</p><p>The pain in his abdomen is razor-sharp. Like a knife plunged deep, it twists cruelly in his stomach. The sheer pain and nausea has Shen Qingqiu curling up pitifully onto the cold stone ground, and when he shakily exhales, his stomach lurches violently—</p><p>—and he throws up.</p><p>The bile that surges incessantly at the back of his throat forces its way past his lips in violent, continuous heaves. It wrenches all the energy he has on him; leaves an acrid taste on his tongue and an acid burn at the back of his throat, leaves him struggling with his snot and tears dripping onto the ground, mixing with his fluids. </p><p>It’s a harsh manner to wake up to, to be puking his guts out so hard he ends up crying reflexively. The lacerations on his chest from the Little Palace Mistress’s whip is a burning sting against the cold air of the water prison, and the ache in his temples and muscles from his fever is a constant agonising pain, but in the face of his bout of nausea and retching, Shen Qingqiu finds that he can’t be bothered to even be concerned about them.</p><p>Really, he should have known better.</p><p>Evidently, Shen Qingqiu had not been thinking <em> at all </em> when he’d eaten that entire bowl of congee off Binghe’s hands. </p><p>Back when he was still Shen Yuan, he’d always had a weak stomach. His defective gastrointestinal hormonal production was just one of the many side-effects of his illness, and Shen Yuan had always ended up regurgitating most of the food he ate. </p><p>Not eating, however, was not an option, so Shen Yuan had spent every single day of his previous life forcing the food past his lips, down his throat, until it settles like a repulsive weight in his stomach— and then vomiting it all back out hours later. </p><p>It’s why he had always been a scrawny thing back then.</p><p>In this life, he has lived spoiled and indulgently under Luo Binghe’s care. He has discovered the joy of eating for the first time in his two lives, relished in the delicacy and the full-bodied depth that spreads across his tongue in bursts of flavours.</p><p>He has come to like eating, to enjoy its simple pleasures.</p><p>Living as Shen Qingqiu under Luo Binghe’s care for so long has made him forget how much he’d originally despised eating. </p><p>Back in his past life, he’d only ate when absolutely necessary, willingly choosing to starve— to feel the raw hunger gnawing painfully at his stomach rather than end up having to puke it all back out so hard he becomes a weak, trembling mess collapsed onto the toilet floor, with tears and snot and dribbles of vomit plastered onto his face.</p><p>Otherwise, how else could he have withstood the hunger pangs? How else could he have firmly rejected Luo Binghe’s cooking, time and time again? </p><p>It wasn’t that Shen Qingqiu had an iron will.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu was just used to being hungry.</p><p>And it’s painful— being hungry.</p><p>But it’s even more painful, to be forced to eat knowing full well of what’s to come. It’s painful, to know you’re now a man who’s unable to do even the most basic of functions, unable to eat without making a mess of yourself for the world to see. </p><p>It’s painful, to know all these and live knowing that this repeats every single day, again and again and again and <em> again—</em></p><p>—and again, even tomorrow, and the day after, and every single day after that.</p><p>Buried in the memories of his past, it’s hard to notice his thoughts spiralling. Shen Qingqiu is only able to focus on the nausea welling in his stomach, the bile ripping through his throat, the rancid stench of his vomit filling the air.</p><p>Another wave of nausea ripples through him, and Shen Qingqiu finds himself sorely regretting his actions from the previous day as he hurls onto the prison floor, spit and vomit painting the ground a disgusting shade of green.</p><p>The last time he ate had been more than an entire week back, before he had been imprisoned in the water prison, before he fell into Luo Binghe’s clutches. If in his past life, he couldn’t even eat normally without having to puke, now that he’s ill again, what made him think that he could stomach an entire meal after having gone days without food? He’d even cleaned out an entire plate of candy and an entire pot of tea.</p><p>Of course he’d puke it out.</p><p>And he’s paying the price for it now.</p><p>Distantly, Shen Qingqiu is aware of the growing mess he’s making on the grounds of the water prison. It splatters against the hems of his tattered robes as he heaves, pools into a revolting puddle at the edge of the platform, flowing into the acid water.  </p><p>The thought of Binghe having to clean up after his mess makes him almost hysterical as he pukes, and that’s how Gongyi Xiao manages to find him—</p><p>—curled up into a ball, robes tattered and stained with blood and vomit, puking what feels like his entire soul out onto the prison floor.</p><p>
<em> “—Elder Shen!” </em>
</p><p>Gongyi Xiao’s gasp comes out horrified, and distractedly, Shen Qingqiu hears the quick, panicked shuffling of steps, muted against the stone ground of the water prison. </p><p>Flustered, Gongyi Xiao settles into a kneel beside him, a comforting hand placed against his back as he gathers the loose strands of his hair from his face. The back of his neck is damp from the cold sweat that trickles down in rivulets, and when Gongyi Xiao holds it to the side in a loose ponytail, Shen Qingqiu feels the flutter of wind, a breezy chill brushing against his nape, trailing in from the openings of the cave. </p><p>It feels too hot, and too cold at the same time.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu’s lips are pale when he finally finishes retching. When he breathes in, the crisp, cold air of the water prison feels like a harsh pressure in his lungs— it forces a cough out of him, wet and weak.</p><p>Gongyi Xiao remains kneeling worriedly, a warm and soothing presence by his side.</p><p>“You've caught me at a bad time,” Shen Qingqiu rasps out wryly, throat burning from the acid reflux. The stench in the air is sour and putrid, and the state that Gonyi Xiao has found him in— the way he’s shaking as he curled up onto the dirtied ground, the way he’s hurled and made a complete mess of himself— it’s such a humiliating and sorry state that Shen Qingqiu finds himself at a loss of what to say. </p><p>He hasn’t felt like this in ages, to be so debilitated by his illness that all he can do is struggle fruitlessly in the throes of his agonising pain. It’s a pathetic situation to be in, to be aware of every pitying gaze and worried frowns thrown at him, and yet still have to rely on the whimsical acts of kindness of the people around him to just <em> survive</em>.</p><p>It’s something he hasn’t experienced in a long while, ever since he’d become Shen Qingqiu.</p><p>Nevertheless, Gongyi Xiao’s appearance here in the water prison is something Shen Qingqiu has not been expecting. It is surprising enough to momentarily distract Shen Qingqiu from his spiral of depressing thoughts—</p><p>—Before this it had been the Little Palace Mistress, and now it was Gongyi Xiao?</p><p>Did all the disciples of Huan Hua have a penchant for breaking the rules and sneaking around?</p><p>“This elder thanks Gongyi Xiao for his… timely assistance,” Shen Qingqiu sighs, slumping tiredly into himself. The exhaustion that washes over him feels almost insurmountable; he had spent a good fifteen minutes flipping his entire stomach upside down and regurgitating its entire contents onto the prison floor— Shen Qingqiu truly didn’t have anything else left in him to expel. </p><p>The bile in his stomach is still churning uncomfortably, and the dull spikes of pain in his abdomen feels like an ever constant ache, but it’s still a lot more manageable as compared to the state he’d initially woken up to.  </p><p>“Elder Shen! I— Are you feeling alright?” Gongyi Xiao frets, hovering worriedly beside him. Hurriedly, he fishes out a napkin from his inner pocket without even waiting for a reply, before reaching out to wipe away the smears of spit and bile on the corner of Shen Qingqiu’s chin.</p><p>His actions are rushed and hasty, filled with underlying panic— the complete opposite of Binghe’s careful and placid way of wiping him off, the attentive and tender care in the slide of silk cloth against his skin. </p><p>“Elder Shen must be feeling thirsty,” Gongyi Xiao fumbles around once he’s tucked his napkin back into his pockets, twisting to remove the gourd slung securely to his robes at his hip. “If Elder Shen doesn’t mind, please have some water,” he says, popping the cork off and offering it to Shen Qingqiu.</p><p>And the way he tilts the gourd into Shen Qingqiu’s mouth— it’s also a stark contrast to the slow, steady way Binghe had assisted him the day before with the tea. The water in the gourd is cold as it dribbles past his lips and spills messily onto his chin, but Shen Qingqiu manages to swallow it down in small sips. The freshness of the water is a welcome respite to the astringent taste of bile in his mouth, and it slides soothingly down his parched throat.</p><p>Once he’s done drinking, Gongyi Xiao finally settles somewhat, looking a little less flustered and panicstricken. He remains quiet, his eyes trailing to Shen Qingqiu’s tattered robes stained with dried blood and bile, to the red, infected lacerations littering his skin, to the puddle of fluids on the prison ground.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu’s skin looks pale and sallow as he kneels tiredly on the prison ground, and the way he looks like a pallid, hollowed-out imitation of himself when he used to be the epitome of regal, detached grace— A wave of emotions washes over Gongyi Xiao, and he bites at his lips in frustration. “This...”</p><p>The nature of the topic is a depressing one, and Shen Qingqiu, even with the burning flare of the wounds underneath his robes and the acidic burn of the residual bile at the back of his throat, he can’t help but let his lips curve up fondly.</p><p>Gongyi Xiao was actually a really tenderhearted child, kind and righteous, with equal parts naive adorability and equal parts charm. He’s similar to the Luo Binghe of the past in many ways, and Shen Qingqiu finds himself seeing fragments of his white lotus disciple he’s lost in Gongyi Xiao. It makes his heart ache in ways he’s unable to ignore; the lump in his throat and painful twist in his chest all the more painful to swallow and to bear.</p><p>“This elder feels quite alright,” he lies smoothly, as if his pain; the throbbing in his temples, the trembling ache of his muscles, and the hazy heat settling like a fog at the forefront of his mind, did not exist. </p><p>Of course, Gongyi Xiao’s expression turns slightly disbelieving, and Shen Qingqiu lets out another sigh. Setting aside his melancholy at the reminder of his precious white lotus disciple, Shen Qingqiu continues, “Gongyi Xiao need not worry about this elder, it was just an upset stomach.”</p><p>Gongyi Xiao’s distressed expression doesn’t change in the slightest. “And these… wounds?”</p><p>“All just surface scratches,” Shen Qingqiu answers evasively, not willing to go into details about the Little Palace Mistress’ visit. </p><p>For a man who had once counted his every day lying in his deathbed, who in his next life stood at the top of a peak with everything he could have ever wished for in his past life at his fingertips— the Little Palace Mistress’ visit had only been a painful reminder of his past, which had merged seamlessly into his present. </p><p>All of a sudden, he’s Shen Yuan again, powerless in the face of his illness, powerless in the face of others. </p><p>“They will heal in due time,” he says.</p><p>“Those are whip marks,” Gongyi Xiao says insistently, his eyes sweeping over and cataloging the wounds underneath his robes, red and tender and seeping with pus. It’s swollen and infected, and Gongyi Xiao’s expression twists uglily. </p><p>The shape of the lacerations, deeply embedded into his flesh and the brutality of it all— Gongyi Xiao finds himself hauntingly familiar with it. </p><p>“This— I should have—” Gongyi Xiao breaks off haltingly, and bites at his lips. He looks slightly furious and guilt-ridden as he stares intently at the wounds marring Shen Qingqiu’s chest, his eyes never straying once. “This one apologises for not being able to stop the other disciples of Huan Hua from acting out. They have been very... <em>concerned </em>over Luo Binghe as of late.” Gongyi Xiao starts, voice a soft murmur.  “Even though Luo Binghe has forbidden the entry of anyone else other than him into the water prison, this place is still pretty far from the main compounds of Huan Hua Palace.” </p><p>Here, his eyes flutter down to look guilty at the floor. “If… If any member of Huan Hua happens to harbour any ill intentions towards a prisoner here, it wouldn’t be too difficult to sneak in, especially with no one watching,” he explains sullenly, completely disregarding the fact that he himself had also snuck in. “And if you’re the favoured daughter of the palace master, it is even less so.”</p><p>Ah, Shen Qingqiu thinks. That makes sense. The Huan Hua disciples had blindfolded him when they brought him here, but Shen Qingqiu vividly remembers walking for an indeterminable amount of time and the endless twists and turns he had taken to come here. Huan Hua’s water prison must be relatively far from the main compounds of the palace, Shen Qingqiu notes.</p><p>Then, Shen Qingqiu suddenly stills. </p><p>The realisation that dawns on him next almost gives him a whiplash. </p><p>He suddenly remembers— the multitude of dishes that Binghe had prepared for him. He remembers vividly, the warmth of the congee seeping into his skin. The heat of the tea, perfectly brewed, comforting against his tongue. The way the dishes had been plated and arranged beautifully, with not even a single spill nor morsel out of place—</p><p>—Binghe must have placed a tremendous amount of care when he’d prepared the meals and brought them over. He must have thought long and hard, from the ingredients and spices of the meals to the materials and design of the dishwares. </p><p>Had he hurried over, every single time, so that the dishes wouldn’t go cold by the time he’d arrive? Had he held those bamboo trays in his hands, carefully and cautiously, and walked all the way through the twists and turns and the thousands of steps to reach the place he’s imprisoned him in?</p><p>The implication of it all steals Shen Qingqiu’s breath away. </p><p>It leaves him with a tangled ball of emotions embedded deep in his heart that he finds almost impossible to unravel, and Shen Qingqiu consciously places it aside; pushes it to the back of his mind, carefully tucks it away at a corner of his heart. </p><p>It’s something he can slowly mull over and pick apart when he’s alone in the water prison later, he decides. </p><p>Then, Gongyi Xiao speaks up again, bringing him back to the present.</p><p>“Elder Shen, please allow this one to tend to your wounds,” Gongyi Xiao implores worriedly, turning to dig through his inner pockets. The dim lighting of the candlelights shimmers off the silver linings of his robes amidst the dull grey of the water prison; it is a bright, captivating glow that draws Shen Qingqiu’s attention away from the physical pain he's in. </p><p>“Leaving them like this will only cause them to fester. It just so happens that I have a bottle of medication with me— it’s not as effective as a recovery pill, but it’s still better than nothing.” Gongyi Xiao fishes out an old jar of medication as he speaks, and Shen Qingqiu’s eyes shift from the soft, shimmering silver, to the dirty brown of the jar, and he immediately perks up.</p><p>“Then, this elder will have to trouble you,” he says, lips curving gratefully. </p><p>Having obtained Shen Qingqiu’s seal of approval, Gongyi Xiao shifts himself in his kneel, inching closer to Shen Qingqiu. With a single hand, he uncaps the cork of the medicine jar with a twist, dribbles it onto his fingers. The bitter scent of the medicine drifts thick and heavy as it lingers in the air, floods his nose and clogs his senses, and the smell of it is so strong it nearly covers up the putrid stench of his expelled fluids in the water prison.</p><p>With single-minded focus, Gongyi Xiao works the medicated oil into Shen Qingqiu’s blistered skin with quick and light touches, pressing at the cuts deep within his flesh. He does it in a systematic order— from the cuffs of his arms to the blades of his shoulders, trailing down to the upper half of his torso, where the worst of his lacerations lies.</p><p>It’s a mind-numbing pain, a kind of searing heat that burns at his skin when the medicated oil meets his open flesh, when Gongyi Xiao presses a little too deeply at the lacerations on his chest to work the medicine in. It is an agonising process; painful enough that it almost manages to bring a fresh wave of tears to Shen Qingqiu’s eyes, long enough that Shen Qingqiu finds himself counting every minute and every second until Gongyi Xiao finally pops the cork back into the jar.</p><p>And even after Gongyi Xiao is done with applying the medicine, Shen Qingqiu can still feel the muscles in his shoulders trembling slightly from the harrowing pain, extending downwards into his arms. Nevertheless, he composes himself with an intake of breath, and turns to nod gratefully at Gongyi Xiao. </p><p>“Much thanks,” he says, quirking his lips. Gongyi Xiao still bears a look of concern, but Shen Qingqiu forges on regardless in favour of the curiosity that has been prickling at the corner of his mind. “Since now is as good a time as any… Is there anything this elder can do for you? This elder highly doubts Gongyi Xiao is here for a humble chat; entry to this prison isn’t permitted, as you’ve said earlier.”</p><p><em> Unless you’re Luo Binghe, </em> Shen Qingqiu continues inwardly, before huffing out a wry laugh when a ridiculous thought occurs to him. <em> Isn’t this the story of Rapunzel? </em> He thinks amusedly. <em> Trapped and locked away, having a rendezvous when I’m supposedly only allowed to meet the witch, Luo Binghe.  </em></p><p>It’s a thought that almost makes him hysterical, but before Shen Qngqiu is able to even further consider the intricacies of Luo Binghe being a witch, Gongyi Xiao has already fished out a letter from his inner pockets. </p><p>“Elder Shen is wise,” Gongyi Xiao praises. “This one indeed had a matter to consult with Elder Shen,” he says as he unfolds the letter and presents it to Shen Qingqiu. </p><p>“Actually, earlier this morning, Peak Lord Shang requested I pass you this letter,” he begins. “So this one had snuck in to deliver the letter, but found Elder Shen... “ Here, he coughs awkwardly, before continuing. “I’ve given it a look, but wasn’t able to understand the contents so I could only bring it here for you to read it yourself.” </p><p>It doesn’t even take a second for Shen Qingqiu to skim over the letter.</p><p>Shang Qinghua’s letter is as simple and direct as it comes, and infuriating in a way <em> only </em>Shang Qinghua could be:</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<em> For Cucumber-bro </em>
</p><p align="center"><em> Gardening in process </em> <em> (ꈍ ᴗ ꈍ✿) </em></p><p align="center"><em> From </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em> Airplane </em></p><p align="center"> </p><p>Feeling like he was going to get an aneurysm on top of his migraine, Shen Qingqiu reigns in his irritation with every single fibre of his being and every ounce of his self-control. </p><p>Airplane-bro had the time to hand-draw an kaomoji, but didn’t actually bother with writing the details?! Even the salutation and sign-off had more words than the content itself!!</p><p>Shen Qingqiu was incensed.</p><p>“...Elder Shen?” Gongyi Xiao prompts hesitantly, after Shen Qingqiu spent a good few minutes staring at the letter disdainfully. He peeks out from behind the letter, subconsciously lowering it into his lap.</p><p>At Gongyi Xiao’s cue, Shen Qingqiu tears his eyes away from the cursed excuse of a letter to meet Gongyi Xiao’s eyes. “...It’s nothing,” he says with a sigh, before forcing a stiff smile back up at Gongyi Xiao. “Do thank Peak Lord Shang for me in my stead. He’s been handling several matters of Qing Jing Peak in my absence.”</p><p>“Ah,” Gongyi Xiao bears a look of complete understanding as he nods. “This one understands. Please rest assured, Elder Shen. This one will be sure to pass the message on to Peak Lord Shang.” </p><p>Then, Gongyi Xiao folds the slip of letter, and drops it into the acid pool of water, watching it as it froths and bubbles, dissolving into nothing in mere seconds. The sheer potency of the acid makes Shen Qingqiu’s scalp go numb and his mind reel; if he puked and hacked a little too hard and ended up rolling off the platform, then wouldn’t he be a pile of bones in a matter of seconds?</p><p>Even starving for weeks wouldn’t be that effective in losing weight!</p><p>As Shen Qingqiu stares at the acid water in dread, worrying about the foreseeable future, he doesn’t notice how Gongyi Xiao casually cleans up his puddle of vomit at the edge of the stone platform with a flick of his spiritual energy. Gongyi Xiao does it quickly and conscientiously, and when Shen Qingqiu eventually snaps out of his thoughts and turns to look at Gongyi Xiao, the spot where he had originally made a mess is now completely spotless.</p><p>Stunned, Shen Qingqiu blinks wordlessly.</p><p>
<em> How on earth??? </em>
</p><p>Gongyi Xiao is standing right next to it, meeting Shen Qingqiu’s gaze sheepishly. “This one has taken the liberty to… clean things up,” he says, rubbing at the back of his head, “Elder Shen shouldn’t have to trouble himself over menial things like this.”</p><p>Then, Gongyi Xiao pauses hesitantly, his eyes trailing down to Shen Qingqiu’s tattered and stained robes. “But this…”</p><p>Gongyi Xiao looks so awkward and hesitant that Shen Qingqiu finds himself taking pity on the poor child stumbling over his words. “What’s wrong?” He prompts, raising a brow.</p><p>“This… This one was wondering if Elder Shen would care for a change in robes,” Gongyi Xiao admits, settling his arm back down. “I’d have to remove the immortal binding cables temporarily, but if Elder Shen is willing to cooperate, this one can replace your robes for a fresh one.”</p><p>Shen Qingqiu remains silent.</p><p>Gongyi Xiao must have been worried that he’d make his escape the moment he’s released from the immortal binding cables, Shen Qingqiu muses. But Shen Qingqiu was a sick man biding his time. How could he escape, when his legs tremble just by supporting his weight? How could he escape, when his breath stutters pathetically with every painful squeeze of his lungs, when his temple throbs and his vision blurs and his world spins when he shifts on his knees?</p><p>“It’s hardly befitting of someone of Elder Shen status to be clothed like this, and it reflects badly on Huan Hua to treat its guests so poorly.” Gongyi Xiao continues, ignoring Shen Qingqiu’s silence. “After all, Elder Shen is still a respected figure in the cultivation world, and this one is sure that Elder Shen’s name will be cleared once the trial is held,” he says confidently.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu grimaces. </p><p>Now that Gongyi Xiao has brought it up, Shen Qingqiu can’t help but be aware of the state of his robes— the splotches of blood and bile a messy stain across the tattered dregs, the ripped tears and fraying edges exposing his raw skin to the harsh icy cold of the water prison, and the way it all clings wetly, disgustingly to his skin— Shen Qingqiu can’t help but let out a shudder.</p><p>He can feel the coldness of the water prison sinking into the depths of his bones, chilling him at his core. The tips of his fingers feel icy and numb behind his back. A fresh, dry robe sounds nothing short of pure luxurious bliss, like a small piece of treasure he’s managed to snatch for himself in the midst of his suffering in this cold, desolate prison he’s in. </p><p>“That would be much appreciated,” Shen Qingqiu eventually sighs out, acquiescing. “This elder is much indebted to Gongyi Xiao.”</p><p>Gongyi Xiao smiles bashfully, hands twisting at his lap. With quick steps, he walks over to kneel behind Shen Qingqiu, fumbling as he grasps at the ends of the rope. Then, he proceeds to untie the cables binding Shen Qingqiu’s arms and torso, pulling at it carefully, unravelling them one by one. He starts from the knot binding his wrists together, going up to the tangles of ropes across his arms and shoulders.</p><p>With each cable that loosens, Shen Qingqiu feels the blood rushing back to his arms, down to his fingers. Feels the tension in his shoulders dissipating, feels his muscles stretch and pull tautly when he shifts his arms back down to his sides. </p><p>The skin across his wrists where the cables bind is scrubbed red and raw, and Shen Qingqiu notes the bruises blooming across his skin, blue purple intertwining with the reds littering his skin.</p><p>All hundred and eight immortal binding cables fall to the ground in a heap.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu’s qi is but a slow trickle, a faltering stutter in his meridians. His spiritual energy does not return to him in a burst of qi. He does not feel the flood in his meridians and the fluid rush of his spiritual energy spill into his body.</p><p>Unlike the previous time he’d been bound by the immortal binding cables during the skinner incident, Shen Qingqiu’s qi does not return like a cascade of a previously stemmed river spilling into its veins. It remains stemmed behind his clogged meridians, and even then, his pool of qi is a shallow, unsteady trickle— weakly pulsing in his damaged qi pathways.</p><p>It’s still there, but it’s weak, and barely responsive.</p><p>From both Without-A-Cure and his illness, it isn’t at all surprising. Between his clogged, damaged meridians and his illness eating away at him, Shen Qingqiu was now practically a mortal man, in everything but title.</p><p>And when he stands— the tremble in his calves, the rush of blood flowing from his head down to his limbs, how his entire vision swims and fades out into a black canvas of darkness and how his breath stutters when the waves of nausea rolls and crashes against him like a flood—</p><p>—Shen Qingqiu crumples back onto the floor.</p><p>He’s stunned for only a moment or two.</p><p>Then, he laughs weakly. </p><p>So... he can’t even stand properly now?</p><p>Gongyi Xiao is momentarily stupefied by it all, but he snaps out of it quickly. “Elder Shen!” He exclaims, hovering over him worriedly. Reaching his arms out and hooking it under Shen Qingqiu’s elbows, Gongyi Xiao carefully supported his weight as the Qing Jing peak lord struggled to stand.</p><p>“Many thanks,” Shen Qingqiu sighs out once he’s back on his feet. Gongyi Xiao is still clutching concernedly onto his arm, and there’s a bruise on his knees from where he’d collapsed onto the ground, rapidly blooming into a hideous purple-blue, but Shen Qingqiu finds that he’s unable to pay them any attention. He ignores them in favour for the most simplest of acts; something that <em> anyone </em> could do with ease. The act of simply standing, with his own two feet on the ground. </p><p>His toes and the soles of his foot are bare, and when he steps on the stone ground of the water prison, he can feel the coldness of the ground, the gravelly rough bumps and jagged rubble pressing pleasantly into the sole of his feet.</p><p>He hasn’t stood on his own two feet in a week. The muscles in his calves and thighs feel weak from disuse, and the sheer effort it took even with Gongyi Xiao’s support leaves Shen Qingqiu entirely winded for breath.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu is starkly aware.</p><p>His body is succumbing to the poison of Without-A-Cure and his illness faster than he’d thought.</p><p>Soon, he’ll no longer be able to feel the ground beneath his feet as he walks.</p><p>Soon, he won’t even be able to stand.</p><p>And soon, even talking will be a difficult feat. Shen Qingqiu won’t be able to easily talk or laugh— to laugh with the people whom he cherishes, to thank the people who’ve stayed by his side, to tell the disciple he’s hurt <em> I’m sorry </em> and <em> you’re so precious to me </em> and <em> I am so, so sorry. </em></p><p>Gongyi Xiao says nothing of Shen Qingqiu’s disgraceful attempt at standing up, and instead, releases Shen Qingqiu’s arms once he’s steady on his feet. With a worried frown, Gongyi Xiao undos his outer robe, and passes it to Shen Qingqiu. “Elder Shen can temporarily wear this first,” he says, snapping Shen Qingqiu out of his thoughts and bringing him back to reality. “This one will replace Elder Shen’s robes for a fresh one and bring it back.”</p><p>Putting his melancholic mood behind him, Shen Qingqiu gratefully receives the robes and swiftly puts it on, replacing the shabby scraps he has for robes with Gongyi Xiao’s dry ones. The difference it makes is almost overwhelming even though Gongyi Xiao’s robes are slightly too small and Shen Qingqiu’s inner robes still remains unchanged; Gongyi Xiao’s dry, warm robes sit comfortably against his skin, and Shen Qingqiu can't help but let out a sigh in satisfaction.</p><p>“It may be presumptuous of this one to ask,” Gongyi Xiao speaks up falteringly after Shen Qingqiu has finished putting on his robes. “Is… Is Elder Shen not feeling well? Elder Shen doesn’t really look like you’re in a good condition; your hands and arms— they’re really cold, when I was untying the cables earlier...” Gongyi Xiao trails off, tactfully not mentioning the way Shen Qingqiu had thrown up all onto the prison ground easier, as well as how he had collapsed the moment he stood.</p><p>“Well,” Shen Qingqiu hums. “It <em> is </em>cold. Of course my arms will feel cold as well.”</p><p>Gongyi Xiao’s expression remains doubtful, but nevertheless he lets the matter drop. “Then, this one will bring over a thicker set of robes later on,” he relents, unwilling to pry further into this matter when Shen Qingqiu has very obviously skirted around the topic. “If Elder Shen is done changing, the cables…?” </p><p>Shen Qingqiu lets out a soft exhale at Gongyi Xiao’s prompt, and settles himself back onto the prison ground.</p><p>In all honestly, there was really no longer any need for any cables of the sort. Shen Qingqiu’s qi has been reduced to a mere trickle, and even just standing wrenches his breath away from him. All the cable does is add another layer of discomfort on top of his physical pain from his illness, and grant others the illusion of a peak lord fallen from grace and dignity, wrestled into submission.</p><p>Nevertheless, he lets Gongyi Xiao re-tie the cables around his wrists, and it takes almost as long as the entire process of removing the cables with how carefully Gongyi Xiao goes about it. </p><p>He tugs at the ropes with a frown, pulling at it and tightening it every now and then, reties the knots again and again when he thinks he’s tied it a little too tight or a little too loose. He’s careful not to bind the ropes across where his skin has been scrubbed red and raw, and he avoids the fresh bruises littering Shen Qingqiu’s skin when he ties the knots on the ropes.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu spends the entire process mourning the loss of his blood flowing through his arms.</p><p>It takes a long while, but Gongyi Xiao eventually finishes re-tying the cables, and Shen Qingqiu finds himself once again tightly bound by a hundred over immortal binding cables.</p><p>What’s left of his qi— the slow trickle, the shallow pulses of spiritual energy, the way it stagnates and clogs heavily in his meridians, eating away at him—  it all fades away into nothingness. The difference is minute, and with so little that’s left, Shen Qingqiu can barely even notice it fading away, disappearing without a trace. </p><p>Mutedly, Shen Qingqiu wonders.</p><p>When death rears his head and his illness reigns…</p><p>Will his life fade the same...?</p><hr/><p>Of course, as luck would have it, Gongyi Xiao does not return in time.</p><p>During the period of time Gongyi Xiao’s left to retrieve a fresh set of robes, Shen Qingqiu’s illness rears its head with a vengeance. This time, it’s much unlike the slow crawl it had initially been; the complete opposite of the way it had slowly creeped up on him and settled into his flesh. </p><p>The way his illness flares— it gnaws mercilessly and erodes away at him, bites at his bones and sinks into the depths of his blood. It eats away at him so fast that Shen Qingqiu is acutely aware of his deteriorating health, of his life slipping through his fingers with every second that passes.</p><p>The world is a hazy blur, and in the midst of his pain, Shen Qingqiu struggles to breathe. His shallow, breathless gasps of air feels like a glacial burn in his lungs, and it’s somehow never enough no matter how quickly he gulps the air and swallows it down, or how desperately he claws at the air with his arms bound behind his back. </p><p>In his world of searing heat amidst biting cold, Shen Qingqiu first hears the click of the stone mechanism, the slow rumble of the rotating gears, and the sound of the waterfall letting up. Slowly, the shower of acid blanketing around him like a curtain dwindles to a leaky stream, and the veil of water parts.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu looks up, haggard and breathless. It takes an incredulous amount of effort to do so, and there’s a relentless pounding in his head pulsing in time with his blood. He squints, and sees a blurry figure stepping into the grounds of the water prison. “Gongyi Xiao? You’re back?”</p><p>The figure comes to a stop before him, and in Shen Qingqiu’s hazy world of grey, he sees striking reds layered between heavy black of the robes, the hems running along the edges fluttering at his feet. </p><p>He shifts his gaze up, and it’s a myriad of deep black entwined with bleeding red.</p><p>Red of the tassel slung across an outer belt, black of his hair cascading down in waves, a bright, burning <em> red </em>sculpted onto his forehead—</p><p>—<em>Binghe. </em></p><p>Luo Binghe cuts an imposing figure, all decked out in thick, heavy robes lined with black and red. His hair is tied up, and the loose ends of his ponytail brushes across his shoulders, down to his chest, curling in soft waves at the tips. </p><p>In his hands lies a wooden bamboo tray that Shen Qingqiu has come to recognise over the past few days. It’s a soft shade of brown, with well-worn ridges and a chip at the edge. The crack runs down in a crooked line to the flat edge of the tray, and Shen Qingqiu recognises it from one of their many conversations that had gone awry, when Binghe had lost his temper and lashed out with his demonic energy. </p><p>In the wake of his anger, he had left a shallow graze across Shen Qingqiu’s cheek from the broken stray rubbles and debris skidding across the cave. The bamboo tray had been chipped, the bowls knocked over, and Shen Qingqiu had watched on numbly as the sauces and chunks of the food spilled onto the prison ground, painting over the dull grey of the platform with a vivid mismatch of colours.</p><p>But this tray is also the very same one Binghe had used when he’d first brought the congee over. It was the same one that was filled with all of his favourite dishes, the very same one Binghe had clutched at everyday as he made his way over to the water prison.</p><p>The tray was a tangible embodiment of his feelings, his conflicting emotions made real; from the hatred and resentment, to the raw hurt wedged deep within Binghe’s heart, to the remnants of his previous devotion and the faint traces of care for his Shizun who had hurt him and thrown him into the very depths of hell.</p><p>It has nothing to do with the bamboo tray at all, and everything to do with Luo Binghe.</p><p>For even when Binghe hated him, even when he had been so consumed by resentment that all he had left was only a burning desire for revenge, there still remained a silver of the white-lotus Shen Qingqiu adores, the lovable disciple he still sees in his dreams when he closes his eyes. </p><p>The implications of it makes it all the more harder to breathe. It brings a rush of emotions so complex and intense that Shen Qingqiu finds himself unable to speak; his words crumbling on his tongue, voice dying to a broken whisper at his throat. </p><p>And even with his blurred vision, Shen Qingqiu can still see the porcelain plates peeking out from the edge of the chipped tray, the soft clouds of steam rising from the dishes, a shimmer of a glistening red at the corner of the tray. </p><p>There’s a painful clench in his heart. It feels a little different; a little rawer than the one he usually feels when his illness wrenches at his heart.</p><p>“Binghe,” he greets weakly. The feverish heat rising from within dusts across his cheeks in a soft pink hue, clouds his mind with a hazy fog, and Shen Qingqiu has to blink rapidly to focus his vision.</p><p>“Shizun,” Luo Binghe greets back cordially as he settles the tray onto the floor, the ends of his ponytail falling over his shoulder in loose waves as he leans down. From a closer angle, Shen Qingqiu is able to see the carefully prepared dishes laid out before him. </p><p>He’s able to see— the finely textured cloth, a pale pine green, wrapped around the pot of tea. The thin slices of ginger mixed into the light, fragrant sauce of freshly steamed fish. The leafy greens of the vegetables stewed in clear soupy broth, the lingering notes of sweetness hanging in the air—</p><p>All this time, Binghe had placed a tremendous amount of effort into preparing his meals. From the bite-sized portions of the food with all the bones and shells removed, to the complexity and depth of the flavours, they had all been thoughtfully and conscientiously prepared for Shen Qingqiu’s ease of consumption even when bound. </p><p>He’s unable to help but wonder; when he had repeatedly refused to eat, had Binghe still meticulously prepared it for him like this? Every single time, with careful hands and steady fingers, prepared them so that the flavours compliments and the dishes would whet his appetite, so that when the food settles in his stomach, all that’s left will be a satisfying warmth deep in his body?</p><p>And when Shen Qingqiu shifts his gaze, he sees another porcelain plate lying beside the thoughtfully prepared dishes. It’s filled with fruits glazed with shiny sugar coats, glossy and clear as they sparkle under the lighting of the water prison. The brilliant reds of the strawberries, glistening brightly under crystal sugar shells—</p><p>—Hard candies.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu swallows a lump in his throat.</p><p>Had Binghe dipped those fruits, one by one, into the honeyed sugar glaze? Had he held them by their stems, meticulously twirled them around with slow and steady hands, so that the glaze fell perfectly around the flesh of the fruits? For something as simple as hard candies where he could have just bought them off the streets, Binghe had chosen to make candied fruits instead.</p><p>An indescribable emotion wells up from within, and Shen Qingqiu ends up staring blankly at the sugar-coated fruits for a good few seconds, before having to tear his eyes away. </p><p>He looks up in time to see Luo Binghe kneeling, the hem of his robes sweeping out from underneath him. </p><p>“Shizun seems surprised to see me,” Luo Binghe quips, almost casually as he settles into his kneel. His eyes rake over Shen Qingqiu’s form, taking in the flushed skin hidden beneath dusty black robes. “It looks like Shizun was expecting someone else,” he murmurs thoughtfully with a slight tilt of his head. “Who was Shizun calling for, earlier?”</p><p>It’s an entirely harmless question, but the way Luo Binghe had stared at him unblinkingly, the way the question had tumbled out of his lips so nonchalantly as if he were just discussing the weather— Shen Qingqiu immediately feels the hair on his skin rise.</p><p>“No one in particular,” Shen Qingqiu denies apprehensively. “Binghe must have heard wrongly.” It’s difficult to get the word past his lips, when every breath he takes feels like fire licking in his lungs. His voice comes out jerky and hoarse, cracking just the slightest bit when he has to stifle a cough, but Luo Binghe does not notice.</p><p>“Is Shizun lying to me, now?” Luo Binghe hums, lips twisting into an unsettling smile. “Who is it, I wonder, that Shizun is trying so hard to protect? Shizun is heartless even when it comes to his own disciple, so this one is naturally curious.”</p><p>Shen Qingqiu falters; at Luo Binghe’s cruel reminder, he’s suddenly thrown back, once again, to that horrific scene at the opening of the abyss. He sees himself— watching on helplessly as Luo Binghe fell. Falling to his knees and crumpling onto the ground. Clutching onto the broken remains of Zheng Yang. </p><p>His hands had bled, at that time, a crimson red pooling over shattered steel as he held Zheng Yang in his arms, holding it close. </p><p>Then, Luo Binghe continues. “Did Shizun think this disciple wouldn’t notice the change in robes? It might look similar but this disciple knows Shizun’s exact size,” he murmurs, eyes roving over the black of Gongyi Xiao’s robes, lingering at how the edge of the sleeves flutters just slightly above Shen Qingqiu’s bare wrist, how the hems sits slightly off the curve of Shen Qingqiu’s shoulder. </p><p>“This robe is much too small for Shizun,” he concludes with a disapproving lilt to his voice. “Shizun is messy when it comes to dressing himself, so this disciple has spent years picking out Shizun’s robes. Every piece of cloth that sits on Shizun’s skin was hand-picked by me, and this disciple had even helped Shizun put every single one of them on, smoothened them down, tied the lapels across your waist, layer by layer.… Even the robes Shizun had been initially wearing in this water prison had been hand-picked by this disciple. Naturally, this disciple knows best as to what Shizun should and should not wear.”</p><p>The smooth rumble of Luo Binghe’s voice fades in and out of Shen Qingqiu’s ears. It’s hard to focus with the feverish heat crawling up his neck that Shen Qingqiu barely registers the possessive edge laced in his voice.</p><p>“Shizun,” Luo Binghe’s eye flashes. “<em>Whose robe is this? </em>” </p><p>Almost immediately, Shen Qingqiu feels his pulse quicken, feels cold sweat bead down his forehead. Luo Binghe’s steely gaze remains fixed on him, his lips still stretched in that same genial smile that sends shivers running down Shen Qingqiu’s spine. </p><p>“This—” Shen Qingqiu almost stammers, feeling himself clam up at the sheer fear that courses through his veins when he sees the barely suppressed rage simmering beneath Luo Binghe’s skin. “It’s really no one important,” he manages hoarsely. “Binghe doesn’t have to concern himself with things like these.”</p><p>“<em>No one important? </em> ” Luo Binghe echoes, and barks out a laugh. “This disciple thinks otherwise. Shizun is even willing to lie to me for this person, how could he <em> not </em> be important?”</p><p>At Shen Qingqiu’s continued silence, Luo Binghe grows even more irate. “Does Shizun really believe this disciple has no way of finding out?” He sneers, lips curling over pearly white teeth. “Disciples of Huan Hua Palace bold enough to break into the water prison are only so few in number. Even if Shizun refuses to reveal anything, does Shizun really believe this disciple has naught a clue as to who this person is? Shizun has been rather cozy with this one particular disciple from Huan Hua Sect, even back then at Jin Lan’s City inn. This disciple would be a fool for not being able to guess.”</p><p>Shen Qingqiu immediately stiffens, his nausea and ragged breaths taking a back seat in the face of the blackened protagonist’s ire. “Gongyi Xiao was just concerned for this master’s well-being,” he defends, muscles tense and wary. Binghe’s cynical expression doesn’t change in the slightest even with his deflection, and Shen Qingqiu can’t help but shoot the blackened protagonist an apprehensive look. “If Binghe already knew, why put up a pretense then? What are you planning?” </p><p>“What does Shizun think I’m planning?” Luo Binghe returns gloomily. “Since Shizun wishes to protect Gongyi Xiao, then naturally this disciple will not lay a hand on him. This disciple was merely curious as to how far Shizun was willing to go to protect a random disciple of another sect, when he was willing to discard me with barely a thought.”</p><p>The heavy implications of Binghe’s words drives Shen Qingqiu back into his bubble of guilt. He’s once again unable to bring himself to speak, not when Luo Binghe regularly laces his words with sharp, cruel reminders of Shen Qingqiu’s faults, not when Binghe’s every sentence wedges painfully into his heart and leaves him spiralling in a web of guilt.</p><p>Not when every single accusation that leaves Binghe’s lips is nothing but the absolute truth.</p><p>Then, Luo Binghe exhales, long and slow, forcing down his welling anger and possessiveness until its a low simmering heat bubbling in his chest. “No matter,” he relents with a sigh. “This matter is hardly worth our time. But Shizun surely must be feeling uncomfortable wearing such an ill-fitting robe,” Luo Binghe says as he eyes the robe disdainfully. “If Shizun doesn’t mind, Shizun can wear this disciple’s ones instead. It will be a better fit and can help Shizun ward off the cold better, since it’s much thicker.” </p><p>Shen Qingqiu presses his lips together tightly. The nausea rolls around heavily in his chest as Luo Binghe speaks. He’s barely able to hear the possessive lilt dying the voice of the blackened protagonist; in his foggy mind, the words that leave his lips sounds like a hazy echo in the far-off distance. Despite this, the image of the protagonist who had blackened under his care still remains ever so clear when Shen Qingqiu looks at him, even with his blurry vision and cloudy eyes.</p><p>Ever so diligent, Luo Binghe paints the image of an earnest, attentive disciple. It burns so familiarly in Shen Qingqiu’s visage that it momentarily steals his breath away, leaves him staring mutedly at the protagonist kneeling before him. </p><p>However, the ghost of his white-lotus disciple disappears almost as quickly as it had come; almost instantly, Luo Binghe’s entire demeanor shifts— and in the place of the silhouette of the white-lotus that Shen Qingqiu had managed to get a brief glimpse of, stood the blackened protagonist who had crawled himself out of hell with bloody fingers and a broken heart. </p><p>Luo Binghe sighs, his lips curving up softly in a manner eerily reminiscent of his old, indulgent smiles. Laden with a twisted possessiveness, it is starkly different from the warm ones Shen Qingqiu still sees in his dreams of breezy summer days with a sweet tender child in tow. </p><p>It sits strangely on his lips; a false, affectionate smile that belongs to the Luo Binghe of the old, rather than the one before him now.</p><p>Gently, the blackened protagonist reaches a hand out to tuck a stray lock of hair behind Shen Qingqiu’s ear. “As Shizun’s disciple, caring for Shizun naturally falls under my duty,” he murmurs, fingertips brushing across the flesh of his lobe. “<em>Mine </em>only, and no one else.” </p><p>Luo Binghe’s fingers lingers at the back of his ear, burning hotly against his skin. It’s a soft, heated touch that sends spikes of shivers running up his spine and up his neck, but in light of his illness coupled with the utter ridiculousness of the situation, Shen Qingqiu finds that he couldn’t even bring himself to care.</p><p>Why was everyone offering him a new set of robes now? What’s up with them changing his robes as if they were playing dress-up with a doll???</p><p>This master is perfectly fine with his current one, thank you very much!!</p><p>“There’s no need,” Shen Qingqiu eventually manages, putting up a facade of forced aloofness. Despite his efforts, his ear still flushes warmly from where Luo Binghe had touched it, blending in with the feverish heat consuming him from within, and Shen Qingqiu has to physically restrain himself from leaning into the comforting warmth. </p><p>Afterall, every modicum of tenderness and affection he receives rom Luo Binghe, from the carefully prepared meals to the soft press of the napkin against his lips and the gentle brush of the damp cloth against his skin-- lies an undercurrent of resentment and an intent to humiliate. </p><p>
<em> It must be. </em>
</p><p>It couldn’t be anything other than hate and a desire for revenge driving Binghe to act in such a manner. </p><p>It <em> couldn't </em> be that Luo Binghe still <em> cared</em>, for the scum of a man who had stained his hands with the blood of his disciple.</p><p>Because Luo Binghe resents Shen Qingqiu.</p><p>Because Luo Binghe <em> should </em>hate Shen Qingqiu, for pushing him into the abyss, for breaking his trust, for building him a life filled with love only for it to all become lies.</p><p>Because such pure-hearted tenderness from Luo Binghe— should only be known by the Shen Qingqiu of the past. The him as of now, who had pushed Binghe into this world’s version of hell, who had already gone three years without it, had no right to feel such affection from the protagonist ever again.</p><p>His heavy-hearted thoughts physically manifests in his actions; without ever meaning to, Shen Qingqiu subconsciously leans away from Luo Binghe’s touch, and misses the way Binghe’s eyes flashes with a flicker of hurt disappointment. “This master is perfectly comfortable in these robes—” Shen Qingqiu says, biting down on his bottom lip to stifle a cough in between. “Binghe has no need to trouble himself.”</p><p>Besides, accepting Binghe’s offer would just mean that he would have to reveal his wounds from the Little Palace Mistress. The blistered lacerations on his skin, red and infected, is by no means a pretty sight to look at.</p><p>For the Qing Jing Peak Lord to have been reduced to such a helpless state, scorned by the masses and disgraced beyond dignity, so much so that even a mere disciple with barely any standing and cultivation prowess could wield a whip over him, hold him down and force him to submit…</p><p>...Even if this was the culmination of Binghe’s scheme, Shen Qingqiu still finds himself unwilling to let his disciple, no matter whether the blackened protagonist or the innocent white-lotus he’d once been, see him in such a sorry state.</p><p>Luo Binghe’s genial smile cracks at Shen Qingqiu’s refusal. He clenches his fists slowly at his lap, curling his fingers and pressing down so hard against his palm that Shen Qingqiu is able to see the tremble of his fists and the outline of his veins mapping across the back of his hands in faded blue-grey streaks.</p><p>“...Is Shizun that unwilling to wear this disciple’s robes?” Luo Binghe asks darkly after a moment of silence. “Shizun would rather wear ill-fitting, shabby robes from someone he barely knows, than to touch any filth that belongs to me. Shizun truly is heartless when it comes to this disciple.”</p><p>Straining with effort to reign his anger in, Luo Binghe exhales sharply, and stiffly forces himself to unclench his fists. His trembling fingers slowly unfurls from the tight clasp they were in, and Shen Qingqiu can see the deep, crescent-shaped imprints marred into the flesh of Luo Binghe’s palm from where the blackened protagonist had dug his nails a little too deeply at. </p><p>And Shen Qingqiu wonders; was this how it was like for Binghe in those three years when he was in the abyss? Was this how he had grounded himself when he was alone, clutching so desperately at himself that it left marks strewn across his skin? Did he let the raw pain of his wounds wash through him, let the physical agony of it all root him in the present so he didn't end up drifting away in the depths of hell, believing that he was an unlovable child?</p><p>But it... really wasn’t that at all, not in the slightest. </p><p>Luo Binghe had never been a filthy demon, never a filthy beast. Luo Binghe has always been—  </p><p>—Shen Qingqiu’s precious disciple, the child that he had lovingly brought up, the person who had brought life into his life even back then when he was wasting away in the hospital as Shen Yuan. </p><p>But what did his words matter, at this point in time? </p><p>The truth remains that Shen Qingqiu had been heartless; he had gently cupped Binghe’s heart, tenderly watched over it, lovingly adored it, before squashing it ruthlessly with those same hands, turning it to shattered smithereens of a blissful dream forever lost. </p><p>Luo Binghe’s eyes are still trained on him, blazing with a searing heat so intense Shen Qingqiu has to avert his gaze, eyes fluttering to the floor. </p><p>Then, Luo Binghe laughs bitterly. “Shizun refuses to look at me, refuses to dirty his hands with anything this disciple has touched. All this disciple has ever done was to crawl out of the hell Shizun threw me in, yet Shizun still scorns me so.” </p><p>The soft timbre of his voice, the black and red of his robes, the twisted smile etched on his lips— the visage of the blackened protagonist in all his entirety, who stood for all the mistakes Shen Qingqiu had made, imprints itself vividly in his hazy mind.</p><p>“Ever since Shizun has been imprisoned here, all of this disciple's efforts have been coldly brushed off, ruthlessly tossed aside.” Luo Binghe swallows, throat bobbing. </p><p>“Tell me, Shizun,” he murmurs, voice almost vulnerable. </p><p> </p><p align="center">
<em> “What do you see when you look at me?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p><em> A filthy demon, </em> Luo Binghe thinks. <em> Scourge of the earth, a beast in human skin. </em></p><p><em> The child whom I’ve raised, </em> Shen Qingqiu answers, a harrowing echo of a whisper in his mind. <em> The child with limitless potential, the child who shines brightly like no others. </em></p><p>
<em> Luo Binghe, the child whom I’ve hurt… </em>
</p><p>
<em> Luo Binghe, the child whom I’ve failed. </em>
</p><p>“Why does it matter?” Shen Qingqiu rasps quietly after a moment of silence, swallowing the bile rising at the back of his throat. The guilt gnaws at him from within, a sickening coil twisting around his beating heart like silver chains of steel. “What difference does it make? Luo Binghe, asking that question… It won’t change anything.”</p><p>It wouldn’t change— the fact that Shen Qingqiu had still pushed Luo Binghe into the abyss. </p><p>That for three entire years, Luo Binghe had spent everyday in a place worse than hell crying for his Shizun while wishing for death. That Luo Binghe, the pure, innocent disciple he had raised, the adorable naive little sheep that gazed at him with eager eyes and a smile so bright it rivalled the stars, had blackened—</p><p>And that <em>all of it</em> <em>was Shen Qingqiu’s fault.</em></p><p>“... Of course. I wonder why I even asked,” Luo Binghe’s sullen voice reverberates deeply in the caves of the water prison, and Shen Qingqiu sees a flicker of hurt dancing past his eyes. “For Shizun to cruelly pierce me with his sword and watch me fall into the very depths of hell, to vehemently reject my existence and scorn me so, how can this disciple not be aware as to how Shizun regards me?” He speaks rhetorically, forcing nonchalance through gritted teeth. “Truly, this disciple is a fool for hoping otherwise.”</p><p>Shen Qingqiu bites at his lips, faltering. In the face of his wayward disciple who he’s hurt countless times, the words buried deep in his heart remain lodged in his throat. When he opens his mouth to speak, he feels dryness at the tip of his tongue, a numbness at his scalp, guilt wrenching at his heart. </p><p>It makes his thoughts tumble to a halt and his voice wither away in his throat; the words seem impossibly difficult to come by, when he’s before Luo Binghe.</p><p>Then, Luo Binghe smiles again, and when Shen Qingqiu looks up, weak and weary from the illness and remorse tearing at him, he sees—</p><p>—the blackened stallion protagonist, in all of his entirety, tethering on the edge of snapping.</p><p>The demonic energy ripples under his skin, pressing into him like a heavy weight on his shoulders. “Shizun refuses to stain himself with anything this disciple has tainted, refuses to sully his eyes looking at the beast of a demon this disciple has become. Shizun surely must think I’m filthy.”</p><p>“But Shizun,” Luo Binghe coaxes gently, eyes softening to reveal deep red irises darkening into the colour of blood. “You’re bound by immortal binding cables, trapped here with no way out. <em> What makes you think I can’t force you to do the opposite? </em>” </p><p>Alarm bells ringing, Shen Qingqiu immediately swerves to the side on pure instinct, dodging Luo Binghe’s arm that has darted out to grab at the lapels of his robes. It wrenches all the breath he has left in him, leaves him floundering weakly in his hazy, spinning world. “Stop this at once, Luo Binghe,” he gasps out, vision swarming in his eyes, breath coming out short. </p><p>Luo Binghe sneers mockingly. “This disciple has tried everything, but Shizun refuses to believe a single word this disciple says, refuses to listen to me when I plead with him. So then, why should this disciple do otherwise? What <em> else </em>can this disciple even do?” </p><p>No longer kneeling, Luo Binghe is standing mere inches away, and he fixes a strange stare at Shen Qingqiu. “Isn’t this really the only way for Shizun to listen to me?” He asks, mutedly. “For if Shizun becomes filthy just like me, then there won’t be a reason for Shizun to shun me any longer.”</p><p>Relying entirely on his reflexes honed from a lifetime of cultivation, Shen Qingqiu narrowly avoids his other hand coming for his shoulder. Luo Binghe’s movements are sharp and swift, with deliberate and precise control in the way he reaches out for Shen Qingqiu. </p><p>The way he moves— it’s the exact same way Shen Qingqiu had taught Luo Binghe years ago, over countless blistering hot and sweltering afternoons, surrounded by the rustling leaves of their bamboo trees. To move with intention, to always have impeccable control over your moves, so that you would never end up accidentally hurting the people closest to you. </p><p>But back then, Luo Binghe had always clumsily tripped over his own feet, stumbled awkwardly into Shen Qingqiu’s arms over and over again, and Shen Qingqiu had <em> always </em>caught him within his embrace, every single time without fail.</p><p>Now, the Luo Binghe standing before him has long since grown out of his clumsy ways. Shen Qingqiu is able to see the growth of his disciple during his three years of absence in the fluidity of his motions; how his every movement is executed with a tight reign over his emotions and a careful command over his strength.</p><p>Luo Binghe’s hand, when he reaches out for him, is gentle and deliberate.</p><p>Yet, even with Binghe’s careful handling, Shen Qingqiu’s ill body is unable to hold his weight up. His muscle trembles pitifully in the aftermath of his struggle, aching sorely from overuse. He’s able to feel every minute tremor in his thighs, in his abdomen and his torso, able to feel the exact moment his muscles give way and his vision topples as he sways—</p><p>—Shen Qingqiu collapses.</p><p>It all happens in a split second.</p><p>With quick reflexes and a sheen of panic flitting through widened eyes, Luo Binghe hastily throws himself forward, reaching out in a desperate attempt to catch Shen Qingqiu by his shoulders. Yet he still doesn’t manage to make it in time; his hand just barely misses Shen Qingqiu’s shoulder by an inch despite his efforts, despite how hard he’s thrown himself without any regards for his own safety that he ends up tipping dangerously forward, without any foothold to even stabilise himself.</p><p>He ends up grasping the sleeve of Shen Qingqiu’s robes instead, his fingers curling over loose cloth fluttering at his upper arm.</p><p>Having only a split second to react, Luo Binghe yanks, pulling Shen Qingqiu’s weight over to him. With a harsh tug and a deafening echo of a rip, Shen Qingqiu’s robe tears across his chest, the cables fraying and loosening along with it, and he tumbles into the sturdy arms of the blackened protagonist.</p><p>Having no proper foothold, the sheer force of the impact has Luo Binghe tumbling and falling to the floor, but nevertheless, Luo Binghe still holds Shen Qingqiu firmly in his arms, hiding him protectively in his embrace that not a single gravel of dirt even manages to scrape across Shen Qingqiu’s exposed skin— even when he ends up skidding across the rough flooring of the prison ground, even when the sharp protruding edges of the gravels dig sharply into his skin and presses into his flesh.</p><p>“Shizun!” Luo Binghe exclaims once he’s managed to catch Shen Qingqiu safely in his arms, his previous sullen mood long forgotten. Tightening his embrace ever so slightly as he holds him close to his chest, Luo Binghe shifts his gaze down to look at him with frenzied worry. “Shizun, are you al—”</p><p>—and the words immediately dies at the tip of his tongue.</p><p>Luo Binghe stills. </p><p>Pale skin, bare collarbones, dusky nipples a soft shade of pink…</p><p>...and a myriad of red, laced all across his skin.</p><p>Luo Binghe sees— stripes of red, blistering and raw, painting along the curve of his skin. Hideous blue-purples blossoming beneath his collarbone, trailing down his chest to underneath his ribs. Remnants of dried blood along the torn edges of open flesh. </p><p>Underneath the dusty black of Gongyi Xiao’s robes, Shen Qingqiu’s inner robes are in tatters.</p><p>Luo Binghe feels his mind go blank, his throat go dry at the sight of Shen Qingqiu, covered in bloodied welts and bruises littered all across his skin, lying weakly in his arms. There’s a searing heat at the point of contact where his arms and fingers digs into the bare skin of Shen Qingqiu’s wounded flesh, and Luo Binghe can feel his fingers burning, feels the scalding heat tear through him at the weight of his shizun in his arms.</p><p>His fingers tremble.</p><p>Luo Binghe is no fool.</p><p>He knows marks of abuse when he sees it.</p><p>He’s more than familiar with them; knows them intimately with his skin and his buried memories of a long lost past. He knows of hurt and abuse with his heart, knows them with the scar over his chest.</p><p>He knows how the welts will form when a whip tears across your skin, knows the exact shape of the lacerations it will take when it strikes against tender flesh. They will blister and bleed endlessly, marr your skin in a disarray of strokes, cross each other in bloodied lines, and leave bruises blooming all over your skin, like lilac butterflies fleeting across a painting.</p><p>And this, Luo Binghe knows with his skin, with the haunting flashes of his memories of his early days at Qing Jing Peak.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu’s hands are still pressing lightly against him in his previous attempt to reduce the impact of his collision into Luo Binghe’s chest. Entirely winded, he doesn’t notice Luo Binghe’s frozen countenance, paralysed in his kneel as he stares down at him with wide, full-blown eyes. The tips of his fingers are icy and cold, and when he struggles to shift himself in the protagonist’s hold, Luo Binghe sees the shallow graze— a faint, thin line of red across Shen Qingqiu's cheek, his very own scar he’d inflicted on his shizun from his momentary lapse of anger only a few days back.</p><p>It's just another one of many; a small cut that hardly makes a difference when there's already so many lining his skin.</p><p>Yet, that shallow graze across Shen Qingqiu's skin snaps him out of his stupor, makes him shake and quiver in guilt and rage— </p><p>—Luo Binghe sees red.</p><p><em> “Who did this to you,” </em> he seethes, rage consuming him. “Who <em> dares?" </em></p><p>Spent with exhaustion, Luo Binghe’s voice fades in and out of his ears. When he peers blearily up at the blurry figure above him, Shen Qingqiu can only see blazing hints of the molten red of his eyes, dark length of hair messy and loose, fumes of black qi rising from the quivering shoulders of the blackened protagonist.</p><p>Right beside Shen Qingqiu, lies the spilled candied fruits, crushed beyond recognition. The red juices of the crushed strawberries seeps out through the broken sugar shells, stains the grounds  sticky and syrupy sweet like fresh crimson blood.</p><p>“...’m... fine,” Shen Qingqiu struggles. His voice comes out impossibly soft, and so, <em> so </em>frail that it immediately jolts Luo Binghe out of his stupor of rage. His eyes snap down to gaze frantically at Shen Qingqiu lying in his arms, and he sees the unfocused, dimming light in his eyes, notices his weak breaths slowly fading, notices the flushed, feverish heat of his skin— </p><p>—Luo Binghe does not understand.</p><p>How long had Shen Qingqiu been hiding all this?</p><p>How long had he been struggling to breathe, contending against the pain, wrestling with his fever eating away at him?</p><p>Had he been ill all this time he was here in the water prison?</p><p>Had he been ill, when he’d lashed out at him in anger?</p><p>Had he been ill, when he’d wiped him off with the cloth? When he’d fed him the congee in little spoonfuls, held the candies to his lips and helped him take sips of the tea?</p><p>Had Shen Qingqiu been ill, when Luo Binghe had manipulated his blood parasites to nip at his veins…?</p><p>
<em> How could he not have noticed…? </em>
</p><p>Shen Qingqiu’s lashes flutter against his cheek. He looks so pitifully fragile like this, with pale, wan skin as he breathes weakly in his arms. A transient and ephemeral existence; a fleeting presence passing him by.</p><p>Then, he lets out a weak, spluttering cough, and even then there’s barely any force behind it. As Shen Qingqiu struggles to speak, his vision narrows to a hazy black, threatening to consume him and pull his consciousness under.</p><p>He can barely see, nor hear anything. </p><p>
<em> It’s cold. </em>
</p><p>“...Shizun? Shizun!” Luo Binghe calls, panicking. Shen Qingqiu can feel the tremble in his arms as he holds him in his embrace, the desperation and the alarmed distress laced into the quivering voice of the blackened protagonist. “What…? What’s happening? Shizun, please talk to me, please hang in there, <em> please</em>, Shizun, I—”</p><p>Luo Binghe cuts himself off, biting at his lip so hard it tears skin and draws blood. Frantically, he removes a hand, and shakily presses it against Shen Qingqiu’s sweaty and damp forehead— even though he already knows the answer to his actions. He knows, and he <em> doesn’t know why. </em>  Shen Qingqiu has always been a strong cultivator with a strong foundation even with without-a-cure; to be this debilitated by a common fever… How can it even be <em> possible?  </em></p><p>“You’re burning up,” Luo Binghe rushes out, filling the silence with panic-laden words. Desperation claws at him, fills him with sheer terror. “Please let this disciple heal you— this disciple can heal you, please don’t worry, Shizun, the heavenly demon’s blood—  it can heal wounds and cure fevers alike, <em> Shizun will be fine</em>—” he breathes, voice shaky as he directs his blood parasites to the wounds marring Shen Qingqiu’s skin, to the heat welling in his blood. “Shizun will be alright,” he repeats, murmuring endlessly to himself. “<em>You have to.” </em></p><p>Overwrought with anxiety, the words that leaves Luo Binghe’s lips sounds like a desperate plea, a futile attempt in convincing himself. Nevertheless, even while struggling to retain the last dregs of his consciousness, Shen Qingqiu is able to feel his wounds healing, the pain fading away, the edges of his open blistered skin stitching themselves back together.</p><p>However, even with the blood parasites working to stitch his body back together, Shen Qingqiu’s fever does not dissipate, and his consciousness still lingers in the far-off distance, hopelessly out of reach.</p><p>Luo Binghe bites his lips. Wordlessly, he tries— again and again and again, ceaselessly, incessantly, but Shen Qingqiu’s fever never once recedes.</p><p>—Luo Binghe breaks.</p><p><em> “Why?” </em>He whispers brokenly, clutching onto Shen Qingqiu’s limp figure in his arms. “Why doesn’t it work? Why isn’t Shizun recovering?” Luo Binghe’s grip on him tightens, staring at him with eyes brimming with tears and looking so, so lost. </p><p>“Tell me what to do, Shizun,” he tries, helpless despair colouring his tone. “This disciple doesn’t—” his voice cracks, “—doesn’t know what I’m supposed to do. <em> Shizun, please.” </em></p><p>A drop of wetness falls onto Shen Qingqiu’s cheek, and when he drags his vision up, slowly, weakly— it’s still a blurry field of grey, with Luo Binghe situated in the middle of it. He’s unable to make out the finer details of Binghe’s contorted expression, and he’s still only able to hear Binghe’s desperate pleas in broken chunks, but nevertheless, he feels his heart clench painfully.</p><p>Mind clouded with a hazy fog, Shen Qingqiu feebly lifts an arm up, and shakily feels for the blackened protagonist’s cheeks. Luo Binghe’s breath immediately hitches at his movement, his breath catching in his lungs, his eyes blown wide staring at Shen Qingqiu’s hand reaching for his cheek. He’s not even fully aware of what he’s doing, and he’s barely even conscious. His arm feels like lead when he lifts it up, and it extorts all the strength he has left in him, but he holds it up anyway. He lets the palm of his hand rest against the curve of Luo Binghe’s cheeks. </p><p>It’s warm, and it’s sticky and damp. </p><p>He can feel the strands of hair plastered messily onto the side of Binghe’s face.</p><p>He can feel the sticky trail of tears beneath his palm, the wetness at the tip of his fingers when he rests it near the corner of his eyes.</p><p>Gently, he brushes it away with a stroke of his thumb.</p><p>Is Binghe crying?</p><p><em> My precious disciple</em>, Shen Qingqiu thinks. <em> There is no need to cry. </em></p><p>“There is no need to cry,” Shen Qingqiu finds himself saying hazily, feeling the last dregs of his consciousness slip away into a world of complete darkness.</p><p>He slowly trails his quivering fingers up, brushing across the skin of Binghe’s damp cheeks, and rests it atop of Binghe’s head.</p><p>He strokes it slowly, once, twice.</p><p>Luo Binghe stares at him, paralysed.</p><p>Then, he promises:</p><p><br/>

<p>Shizun’s promises always sound like lies.</p><p>This, Luo Binghe knows, with the scar over his chest and the broken pieces of his shattered heart.</p><p>Once, he has lived blissful days built from those same lies, made for himself a transient world filled with warmth, enveloped with a love he could only dream to have. He had held that love in the palms of his hands, buried it deep within his chest so he could feel the warmth of it flutter through his veins and nestle in his heart.</p><p>And that’s how he’d ended up with shattered pieces of a broken heart, when the promises all crumbled apart.</p><p>It wasn’t that all of Shizun’s promises had been lies. </p><p>It was just that the ones that mattered, had all turned out to be lies, and Luo Binghe had fallen from a place of love, into a world filled with tears.</p><p>So then, why would this be any different?</p><p>Luo Binghe is a heavenly demon.</p><p>The blood of scourges run through his veins; his beating heart is made from the rotten flesh of humans, molded into shape by the cruel hands of his brethren. His kind stands atop of the lives of innocents, at the zenith of power and sovereignty held up by a pile of bloodied bones and scattered ashes.</p><p>So how could Shizun be on his side?</p><p>With heartbreak comes a jaded heart; Luo Binghe knows this better than anyone else. Afterall, Shizun’s promises had been the truth, once upon a time. Then, Luo Binghe became a heavenly demon, and Shizun’s plethora of promises had turned into lies. </p><p>So— for as long as Luo Binghe remains a heavenly demon, for as long as the mark of a demon continues to burn a revolting red on his forehead, Shizun will never be on his side. It’s something Luo Binghe has slowly come to realise while he’d still been struggling in the abyss, clinging onto the broken shards of his heart and the fleeting warmth from the strike of a dear palm against his chest.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="center">
<em> “This master will always be on your side.” </em>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>See, doesn't it sound like a lie?</p><p>And yet when Luo Binghe looks down at the sleeping visage of his shizun, tucked away under layers of blankets, the heartbroken protagonist can’t help but hear the soft echoes of his shizun’s weak whispers resound in his mind. He can still feel the warmth from his fingers trailing across his cheek, brushing lightly against his ear, the weight of his palm pressing soothingly against his hair.</p><p>...In the end, Luo Binghe knows that he wouldn’t mind settling for these flimsy lies.</p><p>If it meant that Shizun would recover from the illness plaguing him, if it meant that Shizun could pat him again on his head, ruffle his hair fondly, hold him by the palm of his hand and wipe away his tears like how he’d once used to—</p><p>—Luo Binghe wouldn’t mind having his heart broken all over again.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<em> So, Shizun... won’t you please wake up again? </em>
</p><hr/><p>Shizun’s gentleness shines through the softness of his features when he is asleep.</p><p>The angular curves of his jaw, the gentle arc of his brows, the way his breaths come out in light puffs of air through parted lips and the way his hair flutters across silk sheets and curls delicately at the tips as he sleeps— </p><p>—Shen Qingqiu is a gentle, kind man.</p><p>It’s something he hides behind a mask of detached, regal grace, behind the leaf of his fan when he flutters it before his face. He hides his softness and his bleeding heart for the people he loves, puts up a facade of forced nonchalance and indifference, but Shen Qingqiu’s gentleness still seeps past his veneer when he’s surrounded by the people he cherishes— the people whom he loves and treasures silently with affectionate touches and easy smiles hidden behind slender hands and a bamboo fan.</p><p>And once upon a time, Luo Binghe had been one of those treasures.</p><p>He had once spent his days as a precious and treasured disciple of Qing Jing Peak, had once carved for himself a special place in his Shizun’s heart, soaked in his tenderness and flourished under his care. He had once stood by his Shizun’s side, saw his soft smiles illuminated by the warm orange glow of scattered sunlight, in early mornings and late nights, when dawn breaks and night falls.</p><p>Shizun had loved him, once.</p><p>But now, Shizun refuses to even look at him.</p><p>Now, when Shizun meets his gaze, it’s always accompanied by a faltering pause, with lashes pressing gingerly against his cheek when he shuts his eyes and averts his gaze. He turns away as if the mere sight of Luo Binghe standing before him is enough to upend his entire world— as if the sight of the disciple he’s pushed into hell standing before him alive and well is a derisive joke after everything that he’s done.</p><p>It hurts, of course, and the image of it all sears painfully into Luo Binghe’s eyes every single time. Whether he stands, whether he kneels or cries or pleads or <em>begs</em>— Shen Qingqiu will always, <em> always </em>reject the filthy demon that has taken his disciple’s place. </p><p>Because in his shizun’s eyes, all that Luo Binghe had been, all that Luo Binghe <em>is</em><em>—</em> it meant nothing in the face of his blood; the filth and sins of his kind.</p><p>—But even then, Luo Binghe’s regard for his shizun will never change.</p><p>It hasn’t, not in the slightest, even after surviving three gruelling years in the abyss. Sure, he was heartbroken. He had been angry. He had felt betrayed and lost, and so very <em> sad</em>. </p><p>But even then, Luo Binghe still finds himself subconsciously seeking out every small trace of his shizun that he comes across.</p><p>His eyes still flicker to every flutter of pale green he sees in the corner of his vision. He still pauses whenever he sees an assortment of fans, picturesque in its scenic artistry, beautifully displayed at a vendor along some random streets. His breath still hitches minutely whenever he hears the snap of a fan in the far-off distance, and his heart still hammers in his chest when he hears his shizun’s name murmured in passing whenever he’s out running errands.</p><p>Because for a very long time now, in his entire world, there has only ever been one person in Luo Binghe’s eyes. </p><p>It was the person who had lovingly brought him up, coddled him and patted him on the head with a warm hand and an exasperated smile, combed through the locks of his hair in early mornings and late nights when he was feeling down.</p><p>It was the person who had wrapped him up and bundled him in layers of fur-trimmed cloaks and heavily padded robes in the early dawns of winter, who had taught him of cultivation and corrected his forms and guided his fingers to pluck at the strings of the qin in the late dusks of summer, who had showered him with care and held him by his hand and taught him of love through the passing of every season.</p><p>It was the person whose smiles are ever-so-warm...</p><p>...the person whom Luo Binghe loves.</p><p>The first time Luo Binghe had come to this realisation, he’d still been a child.</p><p>It had been many years back, and he’d still been a bright-eyed teen cultivating earnestly under the tutelage of his shizun. He’d been young and inexperienced in the ways of love, and had spent his days stumbling his way through his budding feelings and blooming adoration for his shizun through all his adolescent years.</p><p>Back then, his heart had leapt to his throat whenever their skin brushed lightly across each other. He had felt his skin tingle, felt the heat of it run through his veins. When he’d caught a glimpse of his shizun’s bare skin, hidden under the fine layers of his robes, he’d stammered, fidgeted, and blushed a vivid red. Even then, he’d still nervously continue to help Shizun put his robes on, with trembling fingers and a rapidly beating heart.</p><p>And when Shizun had held him in his embrace, he had felt the warmth of his shizun seeping past his robes, smelt the light fragrance of his shizun radiating from his skin, felt the rush of happiness flood and settle in his veins. </p><p>His heart had been filled with his shizun’s love, swelled to the point it had almost burst.</p><p>Of course, all these thoughts were too disgraceful for the young Luo Binghe to even mention aloud. So, he had buried his filthy desires in the corner of his mind, cupped his hands protectively over his heart, and quietly loved his shizun and watched as his feelings spilled out from his overflowing heart.</p><p>Shizun hadn’t noticed anything at all, but that was alright.</p><p>Luo Binghe was fine just watching his shizun from afar.</p><p>But when Shizun glanced at him and occasionally gave him a smile or fondly patted him on his head, Luo Binghe had always fell a little harder in love.</p><p>And by the time he’d grown into his youth, Luo Binghe was already irrevocably, and dearly in love with Shen Qingqiu.</p><p>He still is.</p><p>But what right did he have to still harbor such feelings for his shizun?</p><p>Luo Binghe, for all that he claimed to love Shen Qingqiu, has done nothing to show for it.</p><p>Instead, he’d done the exact opposite.</p><p>He had locked his shizun up, hid him away in a desolate cave, tied him up with a hundred over immortal binding cables. He’d taken him prisoner, stripped him free of his defenses and left him stranded all alone in the water prison. </p><p>Wrenched away from the safety of the peak he calls home, wrestled away from the comforts of the people whom he holds dear. </p><p>Luo Binghe has done all these even while knowing of the poison running in his shizun’s blood—! Even though he <em> knew </em>how Without-A-Cure eroded away at his spiritual veins, how it left him a weaker shell of himself, reduced to a pale imitation to what the Qing Jing Peak Lord had once been at the height of his prime.</p><p><em> Without-A-Cure, </em>ridicule and shame spreads across his skin like the searing heat of an iron brand.</p><p><em> Without-A-Cure! </em> His distraught comes out as a hysterical scream in the corner of his mind, harrowing and distressed shrieks of guilt. <em> It should have been you, </em> it reminds accusingly, in the silence of the night. <em> It’s always because of you, </em>it sneers, a hollow echo reverberating mindlessly in his skull.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>...It’s always because of him, Luo Binghe agrees, quietly, cloaked in the heavy weight of his guilt.</p><p>—Shizun’s hurt again, and this time, it’s <em> still </em>Luo Binghe’s fault.</p><p>He’s unconscious and weak, and he hasn’t woken up in days. Now, he’s lying wanly on the silk sheets of a canopy bed in a room that Luo Binghe had managed to wrangle from the Old Palace Master in a fit of his frenzy back then, when his hands had still been stained red with the remnants of his shizun’s blood, when all he could think of was the broken whispers leaving his shizun’s lips and the lingering ghostly touch of his fingers across his cheeks.</p><p>Shizun had been defenseless, he had been sick.</p><p>He had been hurt, and his blood had been spilt.</p><p>Luo Binghe had left him <em> alone… </em></p><p>
<em> And he hadn’t noticed a single thing. </em>
</p><p>The guilt tears at him with a ferocity akin to a storm. When he looks down at his shizun’s pale form, he can see the tranquility in his countenance as he sleeps. But occasionally, Shizun still shifts in his sleep, with furrowed brows and a sheen of sweat beading at his forehead when his fever rises in the middle of the night or when he’s caught in another endless loop of recurring nightmares. </p><p>And every single time, the sound of his shizun’s tiny whimpers of pain and his laboured intakes of breath sends a strike of anguish through Luo Binghe’s heart; it rips through him like a hurricane, like a violent tide of heartache that flood his airways and smothers him at his chest, fills his throat with a heavy lump as he grasps tightly at his shizun’s cold hands.</p><p>It’d made him desperate, and he’d wanted so badly to pull Shizun out from his slumber; to wake him up, hold him in his arms and apologise for the little things he’s done and the many more that he hasn’t—</p><p>—For not noticing his pain and his fever, for not being present to stop the Little Palace Mistress’ tantrums. </p><p>For not noticing the bruises littering his skin, for not noticing his flushed cheeks and heated skin.</p><p>Of the many things he’s done… Luo Binghe has failed to do so much more. </p><p>So what if he had been busy investigating the matter brought up by Qiu Haitang? So what if he had been busy trying to gather enough evidence to clear his shizun’s name and set him free? He’d still left his shizun all alone in the water prison, and he’d still hadn’t managed to be by his shizun’s side in his time of need.</p><p>So, how could Luo Binghe even claim to hold a modicum of affection for his Shizun? If he truly cared, he would have known! If he <em> truly </em>cared, then he would have noticed!</p><p>If he truly cared, loved his shizun with the force of the burning sun, then <em> how did he let it all come to this? </em></p><p>Of course, love was never just a simple cause and effect.</p><p>It would be easy if he could just ruthlessly stamp out his feelings, snuff it out mercilessly like the dying flames of a candle, turn it off like the flick of a switch. It would have been easy if he’d just never fell in love with the man who would gingerly hold his heart in the palm of his hands, and yet twist it so cruelly that his carefully constructed world of love would just fall apart, leaving him a helpless mess of a broken-hearted man, who would feel and come to know of love in all of its bittersweet entirety.</p><p>But in the end, Luo Binghe really couldn’t stop himself from loving the one person who had carved himself so deeply into his heart.</p><p>So, he’d delved into his shizun’s dreams anyway, thrown himself into the depths of it, so that he could pull him out and bring him back to his side, so that he could once more see the glimmer of green in the reflection of his eyes, see the small frowns and muffled snorts and soft smiles in the soft amber glow of muted lights—</p><p>—only to find himself in the thick of it; a dreamscape filled with nightmares, a parallel to his own.</p><p>Enless, recurring dreams of tears and grief, of a bloodied sword and a young boy thrown down a rift.</p><p>Shizun’s memories of the opening of the abyss are never linear; it comes in fast, chaotic flashes of moving images, muddled films of blurred terrains interspersed amongst vivid stills of strikingly clear memories seen from his shizun’s eyes— like the bright crimson pool of his own blood, the speck of dirt lining the corner of his cheek, the fumes of demonic qi a desolate black. Sometimes, a roaring silence accompanies still panoramas, and other times it’s a blend of deafening shrieks and wails of humans and creatures alike. </p><p>Then, the snapshots and frenzied cuts flashes and repeats; blindly fast and haunting, an erratic loop of tearstained memories. </p><p>Soft, broken whispers of a young boy kneeling, jagged edges of a rocky cliff, derisive monotonous taunts of an ice-cold demon, red staining the robes of an unblemished white, the silver of a blade wrenched into a young boy’s chest, the silver of his blade wrenched into his disciple’s chest, the silver of <em>his blade wrenched into his disciple’s chest, </em>the silver of <em>his blade wrenched into </em><b><em>Binghe’s chest</em></b>—</p><p>—and then it repeats; an endless static loop of grief.</p><p>Shizun’s nightmares are mirrors to his own. It’s so similar that it’s easy to forget they’re not of his own, easy to forget that he’s a mere audience to the erratic pulses of harrowing memories thrown at him instead of the lead living in the midst of it.</p><p>Nevertheless, the implications of it all brings yet another wave of helpless anguish hurling through him; it figures that even when Shizun’s asleep, Luo Binghe was still the cause for his nightmares and suffering. </p><p>Yet, for Shizun to be constantly reliving that one particular day in his dreams— did it mean Shizun had felt guilty, then? Had Shizun regretted it, when he’d pushed him down into the abyss? Had he jolted awake in the middle of the night, stared into the dark and saw the afterimages of his dreams flash behind his eyes? Of the things he’d done; of the bitter tears and bloodied stains pooling at his disciple’s heart, of the way he fell as his hopes crumbled apart? </p><p>But Luo Binghe can’t help but wonder if that was too wishful a thought for him to have— a wistful thought conjured by the remaining fragments of his shattered heart, formed from the treasured memories of his bygone days of an unconditional love and a familiar warmth, that his shizun might still have a place for him in his heart.</p><p>But Shizun’s stance has always been clear, even after three long years.</p><p>So how could Luo Binghe even dare to hope?</p><p>After all... he has already been discarded, a very long time ago.</p><hr/><p>Despite everything, Luo Binghe still spares no effort in caring for his shizun while he’s still unconscious. Even with the gaping hole in his heart, he still goes about it carefully and conscientiously, and pretends that he does not feel the stinging burn at the back of his eyes and the painful lump in his throat.</p><p>He still carefully wipes off the sweat beading on his shizun’s skin with a damp cloth whenever his fever rises, and pulls him out of his nightmares whenever he tosses lightly in his sleep. He still gently tucks the covers of the quilts over his shoulders, brushes the stray locks of his hair behind his ear, sits quietly by his bedside as he sleeps.</p><p>Luo Binghe still tenderly cares for his shizun through warm middays and chilly nights, and holds his hands till dawn breaks into daylight.</p><p>When he settles him onto the bed and tucks him under the cover of the quilts, his body is limp and unresponsive. Yet, he can still feel the shallow breaths beneath his ribs and the soft thrum of his heart beating underneath his skin. It’s weak, but it’s still <em> there;</em> delicate, fleeting pulses of his life humming from within.</p><p>When he wipes him off with a warm, damp cloth, he can feel the warmth of it slowly seeping into his skin, the warm flush it brings to his ivory pale cheeks. When the sun sets and the moonlight washes into the room, he can see the little goosebumps rising, the midnight breeze like frozen lace on his skin even when it’s still midway into a comfortable spring.</p><p>And when he presses against the soft flesh under his skin, kneads at the kinks in his muscles with the ball of his thumbs and gently roll his limbs around his joints, he can see the barest hint of a wince flitting by his shizun’s face as he sleeps, a small frown marring his face.</p><p>The next day, bruises bloom, freshly littered across his skin.</p><p>Shizun is limp and unresponsive when he’s unconscious— but his body is in no way the same.</p><p>Shizun’s body, even when no longer bound by the cables, still remains like a weakened, mortal shell. No matter how many times Luo Binghe clears his clogged meridians from Without-A-Cure, no matter how much qi he transfers over with his fingers pressed against his shizun’s pale wrists, it all fades into a weak, faltering stream within his veins, and dissipates into a barely noticeable pulse underneath his skin. </p><p>Yet even with his deteriorating health and his stagnant qi, Shizun’s body still remains sensitive. It flutters to the press of Luo Binghe’s fingers against his flesh, and blossoms with bruises under his touch. It drops too easily to a freezing chill when the winds trail in from the openings of the window, and flushes too hotly when he layers him under one too many quilt.</p><p>Shizun’s body is entirely too responsive— in how his illness shows in every minute ways.</p><p>And it brings an even greater bout of guilt; an immense feeling of weighted <em> hate </em>for himself at his newfound realisations—</p><p>—Shizun’s temperature fluctuates too much, and he bruises far too easily.</p><p>Shizun’s temperature fluctuates far too excessively for a small change in temperature even under Luo Binghe’s care; a simple breeze becomes a biting chill when it touches his skin, and a comfortingly warm afternoon becomes a suffocating heat that builds with his fever and pulls him deeper into his nightmares.</p><p>Shizun must have felt cold in the water prison, if his body already reacts this way to such a minor temperature difference. Huan Hua’s water prison is really only slightly colder than their palace; a comfortable temperature even for mortals due to the sheer number of protective talismans and charms set up around the outskirts of the prison. </p><p>But with Shizun’s body as it is, feeling the slightest change in temperature to its extremities, Shizun <em> must </em> have felt cold. He’d been surrounded by an expanse of acid water, stripped of his cultivation and dressed thinly in flimsy robes — with his body as it is, how could he have <em> not </em>felt cold?</p><p>Yet, no one had noticed. Huan Hua Sect never had a habit of providing any of their prisoners—usually cultivators so degenerate they worthed less than scum— with a thicker set of robes or blankets. There simply wasn’t a <em> need </em> to, and no one actually <em> cared. </em></p><p>But Luo Binghe did—!</p><p>He cared—! So much, that he had spent every second of his day distracted from his investigations wondering if his Shizun had ate, spent every minute of the night lying awake in his bed wondering if his Shizun was asleep. He had spent his every living moment and his every single breath thinking of that gentle man who had once held him by his hand, of the cruel person who had clawed at his heart, of the beautiful soul that he has come to love.</p><p>Why then, had Shizun not said anything? If Shizun had just mentioned— if he’d just <em> shown </em> the slightest hint that he’d been cold, Luo Binghe would have given <em> anything </em> to ensure he was comfortable!</p><p>He would have brought him blankets, those heavily quilted ones that he knew his shizun loved, and provided him with as many of them as he wanted! He would have given him a thicker set of robes, he would have bundled him in quilts and layered a fur cloak over his shoulders the way his Shizun had done for him back then whenever winter first fell. He would have warmed his fingers and brewed him tea, he would have <em> stayed by his side like how he’d once did</em>—<em>! </em></p><p>—but because he <em> hadn’t </em> been by his shizun’s side, it is only now, <em> far too late</em>, that Luo Binghe realises: Shizun’s bruises— they bloom far too easily on his skin, even when it’s only a light press against his skin, even when it’s not supposed to hurt. </p><p>He winces in his sleep when Luo Binghe shifts and tucks his stray limbs back under the covers of the quilt, and frowns in pain whenever he presses lightly against his skin to work out the knots in his muscles. Shizun must feel pain in <em> all </em>its entirety— must have felt it with an intensity greater than anything Luo Binghe can imagine, and then hid it behind a mask of nonchalance whenever Luo Binghe came by the water prison.</p><p>And Luo Binghe wonders; was that why Shizun had been so afraid of him after he’d used his blood parasites to coerce him into eating?</p><p>Was they why his shizun had stared at him with wide-blown eyes when he’d lifted the spoon to his lips, furrowed his brows and bit at his lips with badly-concealed anxiety when he’d wiped him off with the cloth, flinched away from him when he’d held him in his arms?</p><p>But he’d never actually meant to hurt Shizun with his blood parasites! He hadn’t actually meant to— <em>he would never!</em> He’d only wanted for his shizun to listen; for Shizun to eat the food he’d prepared, for Shizun to let him tend to his needs and care for him like how he’d once did for a worthless kid he’d picked off the streets—</p><p>—Luo Binghe hadn’t… he didn’t… he’d <em> never </em> wanted to hurt his shizun. The blood parasites were <em> never </em> supposed to have inflicted that much pain; the most that Shizun should have felt should have been a little nip within his veins, a tiny spark of heat in his blood at the very worst <em> .  </em></p><p>But Shizun had been frail and weak, he had been ill, and he had been suffering <em>all alone. </em>To have been feeling the raw pain gnaw at him at an intensity greater than one can imagine— how could he have possibly withstood the blood parasites? How could it possibly not have <em>hurt? </em>Exactly how much pain had his shizun endured, <em>under his very own hands…?</em></p><p> </p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>...Shizun had <em> cried</em>, at that time.</p><p>His lashes had been wet with tears, and he had shook and trembled in Luo Binghe’s hold. </p><p>...<em>So, why hadn’t he stopped then…?  </em></p><p><em> Why didn’t you? </em> A haunting echo resides in the depths of his mind, it rears its head when he finds himself staring at the bruises blooming across his shizun’s skin. <em> How could you, </em> it accuses, at random intervals of the day; when he comes back into the room holding a fresh set of sheets or a bucket of water and a freshly laundered cloth to bring his fever down. <em> He cried! </em> It screams. <em> Your Shizun! </em>It screeches. </p><p><em> ...You’ve hurt him, </em>it says, when he stops at the doorway and stares at the hues of purple and blue and remembers everything that he’s done, and everything else that he hasn’t.</p><p>And then, when he’s alone or when the moon rises and the silence hangs thickly in the air, it asks again, quietly—</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">—<em>how could you? </em></p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>...Even after everything, the days still pass with an unsettling normalcy, and the moon still shines bright even in the darkness of the night. It streams past the slit in the curtain windows, fills the room with a soft, shimmering silver, and casts a moonlit glow on his shizun’s pale form as Luo Binghe stands by his bedside.</p><p>His mind is a cacophony of blistering screams and anguished wails of the guilt residing in his mind. In the torrid swamp of his emotions he can only hear the soft sighs of his shizun’s weak breaths echoing in the disquiet silence of the room.</p><p>...In the end, Luo Binghe knows that his shizun had been right.</p><p>After all, for him to have hurt the man he loves…</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">
<em> ...what else could he be, but a demon in human’s skin…? </em>
</p><hr/><p>Sometimes, there is a warm hand pressed against his forehead.</p><p>It will gently brush across his temples, and linger over the locks of his hair.</p><p>And every so often, it will carefully thumb across his brow, sweep a particularly irritating strand of hair away from his eyes, before tucking it behind his ears. It’s warm against his skin and pleasant to the touch; a calloused hand with a gentleness that shines through even in his dreams.</p><p>Other times, he’s a little too cold.</p><p>It happens more often than he’d like, but occasionally, he will hear the flutter of the curtains, and feel a chilly breeze blow past his cheeks. The wind will brush across the skin of his exposed wrist, dance its way past the tip of his ears and breeze airily down the curve of his neck. Sometimes he even hears the chirping of the sparrows outside, along with the flutter of wind that feels a little like spring.</p><p>Then, the bed will shift— a heavy weight will settle by his bedside where sunlight streams in and catches onto his skin. The sheets will rustle and the bed will dip, and in his dreams he will feel a comforting warmth, heavy and thick, being pulled up to just under his chin.</p><p>It feels like a blanket of love, he would later come to think.</p><p>But suddenly, it’s no longer cold, and he will drift back into sleep.</p><p>Or sometimes, when he finds himself lingering just beneath the horizon of his consciousness, he thinks he hears soft, muted whispers coming from his bedside. Usually, it takes on a soothing tone, and sometimes it even sounds a little sad, but nevertheless it’s still warm, just like that gentle hand that holds his own as he sleeps.</p><p>But it isn’t always soft whispers and tender touches of a palm pressed against his skin.</p><p>Sometimes, there are long periods of silence instead.</p><p>Long, trembling fingers will curl around his own, and occasionally, he will hear the voice that speaks to him in low, hushed murmurs pause falteringly in its speech. It cracks, sometimes, when it speaks, and goes off on a self-depreciating tangent on some others, but in all of its facets, they sound a little like desperate, heartbroken pleas.</p><p>And other times, there will be a flurry of noises. In all of those instances, the soothing voice that he hears by his bedside will disappear. In its place he will hear a muffled exchange of heated whispers and angry murmurs coming from a slightly farther distance, and suddenly that blanket of love he’s burrowed himself under will feel like a smothering weight trapping him in place with a suffocating unease.</p><p>It doesn’t take him long to understand the implications of everything that’s been happening so far. He’s not always aware of it, but he knows that every so often, he will flit into a hazy state of consciousness and linger just barely at the cusp of his dreams, drifting along the encompassing darkness of his mind.</p><p>And in those moments, there is <em> always </em>someone by his side; a steady presence that never leaves, one that remains constant even as he drifts in and out of consciousness.</p><p>Yet, he never fully wakes, even when he’s struggling to surface from beneath his dreams, even when the act of this person standing by his bedside waiting for him to wake is so painfully familiar it even brings flashes of his memories back to him.</p><p>—He thinks he even sees his gege, in one of his dreams.</p><p>The image of his gege that his mind conjures up is always unchanging; he looks the same as ever, sitting by his hospital bed waiting for him to wake. He probably looks different now, he belatedly thinks. After all, it has been a good few years since he’d last seen him; he wonders if his gege has grown slightly more into his features, now? Has he grown any taller? Does he still look the same? </p><p><em> How have you been doing, </em> he’d asked, to the image of the person he’s conjured up for himself in his mind. <em> I miss you, </em>he’d told the gege in his dreams.</p><p>Of course, the illusionary gege that he sees does not respond. </p><p>He sits in the chair by his bed in the blindingly white hospital ward constructed from his memories, looking cold, impassive and every bit as unshakeable as Shen Yuan remembers his closest pillar of support to be— and he reads a book, flipping through the pages silently as he waits for him to wake. </p><p>And every so often, he’d look up, and gaze at him as if he’s aware that his brother is there, standing right before him. But then, he’d reach out, stretching past him, and brush the bangs away from the face of a Shen Yuan who’s sleeping behind him— another image of his memories he’s conjured up in his sweet, nostalgic dream. Then, he’d sigh and settle back into his seat, and continue flipping through the pages of his book.</p><p>This gege does not belong to the Shen Yuan as of now. He belongs to the Shen Yuan of a long lost past, to the Shen Yuan before he died, to the Shen Yuan who still had a gege when he had still been alive.</p><p>But nevertheless, gege has always been there, by his side.</p><p>Of course, he dreams of his meimei and his da ge, too.</p><p>They’d always been busy; da ge with his job and meimei with school. But they’d always found time for him, regardless, whether it was after school, in the late evenings, or on early mornings of the weekends. They’d chatter noisily and endlessly, make an utter mess of things, laugh brightly and bring colours into in his quiet ward with washed-out walls—</p><p>—They’d also always been there, by his side.</p><p align="left"><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p>...Even after two lifetimes, nothing has really changed.</p><p>In the end, even now, there’s still a person standing by his bedside, waiting for him to wake.</p><p>A person who would speak to him in low, quiet tones, who would gently tuck him in under the sheets and hold his hand as he sleeps. A person whose hands are much larger than his own, a person whose hands are calloused from strife and roughened with scars.</p><p>But somehow, that gentle hand with calloused fingers, for some reason, feels heartbreakingly familiar, and Shen Yuan....</p><p>...Shen Yuan tries his best to hold that gentle hand back, even in his dreams.</p><hr/><p>Eventually, he wakes up.</p><p>The world that he comes to, at first glance, is almost of no difference to the world that he sees in his dreams.</p><p>It is still pitch black, and endlessly dark, and he still feels like he’s floating in an arbitrary space of nothing. It feels surreal, and equally as disorientating, to finally be awake after struggling for so long in between the cusp of reality and the recesses of his mind, trying to wake. For a moment he wonders if he’s still trapped in his web of dreams.</p><p>But his limbs feel like lead by his side, and the slow throb in his temple that he wakes up to tells him that it is <em> anything </em> but a dream. The physical discomfort of his illness weighs down so heavily on him it’s hard not to mistake it for what it is— that after struggling for so long he’s finally awake, and that now he’s awake he has to face the consequences of what his illness brings.</p><p>That every breath he takes will bring him one step closer to death, and that even in this life with a failsafe in hand he will still have to leave his precious people behind.</p><p>It is a heavy thought to bear.</p><p>It’s almost suffocating, how the knowledge of his impending end weighs down on him. It feels like a noose tied around his neck— that taut, fraying string that is his life, ready to snap at any given time. It makes every breath he takes feel a little more ragged, makes every breath that he takes just that much more precious, in this second chance at life. </p><p>In the swirling deluge of his emotions, he can feel the exhaustion settling into every crook of his body. Just keeping his eyes open drains all the energy he has in him, and for the first few minutes after he wakes, he can only stare blearily up into the empty darkness as he lies uselessly on the bed, feeling the reality of his situation catch up to him.</p><p>The room is entirely silent.</p><p>It is only then, that he hears—</p><p>—soft and steady breaths coming from his bedside.</p><p>It’s so quiet that it’s barely noticeable; breathy sighs much like a soothing lull spilling into the silence of the room. And when he strains his neck and turns to look—</p><p>—Luo Binghe is kneeling by his bedside.</p><p>He’s slumped over in what looks like a particularly uncomfortable position, with his head buried in the folds of his arms, tucked away into a little small spot at the side of the bed. His brows are pulled into a small frown as he sleeps, and the corners of his eyes are tinged red, like he’s been crying. He has one arm slightly extended, and when Shen Qingqiu trails his eyes along the curve of his arm, at the end of it, he sees—</p><p>—long, calloused fingers curled loosely around his own.</p><p><em> Ah, </em> he thinks blearily when realisation dawns upon him. <em> So that hand had been his. </em></p><p>Luo Binghe’s hands are very much different than the ones he sees on himself on a daily basis <em> (the one that he’d used to push his disciple down—);</em> when laced over his own, Shen Qingqiu can see the difference in their skin tone— the way Binghe’s hand is a few shades darker than his, the way his own hands look pale and bony in comparison when Binghe curls his hands loosely over his. </p><p>In the dregs of his earliest memories of his second chance at life he can remember the fair, lithe hands of his white-lotus disciple tugging adoringly at the hem of his sleeves and occasionally fumbling with the hilt of his training sword. </p><p>Now, Binghe’s hands are no longer the same as what Shen Qingqiu remembers it to be; having grown into the size befitting of his status as a stallion protagonist, his hands are now slender and wide-knuckled and so very broad, with firm muscles tracing along the veins at the back of it. Rough from the calluses formed during his time in the abyss, it is nothing like the pair that he remembers belonging to the sweet, young child he’s raised under his care.</p><p>Now, Luo Binghe’s hand dwarfs over his— and he holds it with such a tender grip that Shen Qingqiu can’t help but let his eyes linger on their loosely intertwined hands resting on the covers of the bedsheet.</p><p>They way Luo Binghe clutches on to Shen Qingqiu as he sleeps— he laces their fingers together desperately as if Shen Qingqiu would disappear the moment he lets go. Their fingers are entwined around each other, locking loosely at their knuckles, with the flesh of their palms just barely touching.</p><p>Strangely enough, the weight of his hand and the warmth of his fingers against his skin feels so comfortingly natural against his own that he wouldn't have noticed it otherwise; Luo Binghe must have clutched at it desperately through every minute of the day, held it firmly within his grasp through every second of the night that it became only natural to feel the warmth of Binghe’s fingers interlaced with his.</p><p>Distracted by his thoughts, Shen Qingqiu’s eyes flit back up to the image Luo Binghe paints as he breathes quietly in his sleep, looking nothing like what he’s expected the blackened protagonist to be. He sees— exhaustion tracing dark smudges underneath his eyes, loose hair tumbled over his shoulders, tear stains at the corner of his eyes. </p><p>He looks particularly small and vulnerable like this, despite how contrary those descriptions are to the image of Luo Binghe that has been imprinted into his mind, despite how those descriptions are the exact opposite of the simmering anger and threatening smiles that Luo Binghe had donned himself with whenever he stood before the man that had pushed him into hell.</p><p>His heart pangs.</p><p>It’s an indecipherable emotion that steals his breath away; one that he cannot place when he stares at his disciple. He sees the fatigue lining his countenance, feels the desperation in the way he holds his hand. He remembers the gentle touches pressing lightly against his skin, and the hushed whispers he hears in his dreams.</p><p>Luo Binghe continues to sleep.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu does not retract his hand.</p><hr/><p>The next time he wakes, it is well into the day.</p><p>This time, the world that he comes to is nothing like the ones he sees in his dreams; colours stain every corner of his vision, and he wakes up to the faint rustling of the leaves dancing in the wind. The sunlight filters into the room like golden rays of warmth, kisses along his eyelids as he wakes. </p><p>But when he opens his eyes, Luo Binghe is no longer by his bedside.</p><p>Instead, he wakes up alone, with only the memories of a warm palm pressed comfortingly against his own. </p><p>Yet for some reason, even when he is nowhere in sight, he can still see traces of Luo Binghe's presence littered everywhere in the room. </p><p>When he struggles to sit, the sheets of the quilt fall and pools around his hips, and Shen Qingqiu can see how he's been tucked carefully and gingerly under the covers of the quilt when he'd been asleep. </p><p>When he looks up and gazes in the direction of the sunlight streaming into the room, he can see that the windows of the room are left slightly ajar, and that the drapes of the curtain have been pulled slightly apart. The wind blows past the curtains of the room, and when Shen Qingqiu breathes in, he can taste the freshness of the air on his lips, feel the spring breeze caress his cheeks. </p><p>It’s a little cool against his skin, like the softest breaths of a mountain zephyr reminiscent of the ones in the bamboo forests back in his Qing Jing Peak. That coarse, tattered dreg that he had for robes and the fraying cords of the immortal biding cables are no longer anywhere in sight.</p><p>Instead, a freshly laundered piece of robe sits comfortably on his skin, hanging loosely off his shoulders. It’s thin and airy and soft like silk, the material sheer enough that he can feel the cold wisps of the wind cooling his feverish skin, yet also thick enough to ensure that he wouldn’t go cold— a set of robes specially prepared and specifically embroidered to be of a perfect thickness in consideration of his fever. Tucked away underneath the layers of quilt, it is only a perfect cocoon of warmth. </p><p>And when he looks up, just a few <em> chi </em>to his left where Binghe had spent the previous night lying by his bedside, there is a wooden round table sitting in the middle of the room, just past the decorative folding screen. On top of the table lies a wooden bucket filled with water, with a used, damp cloth hastily thrown over the edges of it.</p><p>Unbidden, the image of his disciple sleeping by his bedside flashes in his memory as he catalogues the interior of the room he’s in. </p><p>At first glance, he sees pure, unblemished white of the sheets of his quilts, sees specks of red of the cranes hidden amidst sheens of cheaply painted gold reflecting off the folding screen in the room, sees the dirty browns of the wooden table and the pearly white hue of his robes. But when he looks again, he sees the colours and the fittings as well as every single trace of care that his disciple has left behind in his wake—</p><p>—Shen Qingqiu continues staring, feeling his heart twist peculiarly.</p><p>...Strangely enough, the palm of his hand feels empty.</p><p>Nevertheless, he shoves that thought to a faraway corner of his mind in favour of regaining his bearings—</p><p>—How long has it been? How much time had he spent sleeping? </p><p>And where was he?</p><p>Shen Qingqiu doubted he was still within the caves of the water prison. After a quick glance around, it is obvious that he has been transferred to one of the spare, unused rooms in Huan Hua Palace. </p><p>Sparsely furnished and well worn with age, the room is very much telling of Huan Hua Sect’s penchant for ostentatious designs, especially with the number of gaudy decorative embellishments hanging off the walls and adorning all four corners of the room. Looking like it’s only just recently been cleaned, the room is brightly lit and well-taken care of, with no trace of dust or dirt lining the edges of it; a welcome respite to the dingy old cave that he’d initially been trapped in. </p><p>But no matter how sickly and delirious he has become in the haze of his fever, Shen Qingqiu is in no way delusional enough to think that this was the normal course of occurrence for a prisoner— for a traitor of the cultivation world who had been thought to be despicable enough to warrant being locked up away in Huan Hua’s Water Prison.</p><p>Preferential treatment, then.</p><p>For whatever reason, Binghe must have fished his unsightly self out of the water prison, and then carried him all the way here to recuperate. The old palace master definitely wouldn’t have allowed it, but the protagonist halo was The Protagonist Halo™, and Shen Qingqiu can still vaguely remember hearing muffled arguments behind closed doors when he’d still been asleep. Binghe must have wrangled a room out of the Old Palace Master by sheer protagonist OP prowess, and then proceeded to defy every single rule and norms regarding Huan Hua Sect’s prisoner etiquette by tending to Shen Qingqiu’s health.</p><p>Then, where was Luo Binghe…?</p><p>Shen Qingqiu can’t help but feel a complicated emotion wash over him. </p><p>Ever since he’d transmigrated into this life as Shen Qingqiu. he has so firmly believed in the blackened nature of the protagonist that he’d all but slapped the image of a cruel dictator onto his beloved disciple and watched him grow up through a heavily filtered lens. But in reality, every single action that Luo Binghe has taken ever since he’d collapsed in the water prison had been the complete opposite of his expectations.</p><p>It’s an unsettling realisation that leaves him feeling on edge; none of Binghe’s actions would have made sense if he still wanted to string him up by his guts and cut off all his limbs.</p><p>He wouldn’t have spared that much effort in tending to Shen Qingqiu, wouldn’t have tucked him in diligently under the covers of the quilt, wouldn’t have clutched onto his hand desperately while he sleeps.</p><p>If it were only a few weeks ago, before he’d collapsed from sheer fatigue and the cumulation of his illness eating away at his health, he would have confidently said that as an avid reader who had followed the original PIDW to the end of its series, he knew Luo Binghe’s character and his motives like the back of his hand.</p><p>But now… when he thinks about the dark smudges of exhaustion underneath his eyes, and remembers the way he’d kneeled and fallen asleep while curling himself into a ball at the side of his bed like he was afraid to take up space, Shen Qingqiu finds that his mind draws a blank when it comes to deducing the motives of the disciple he’s raised.</p><p>The way Luo Binghe had held onto him…</p><p>Shen Qingqiu can’t help but allow himself a brief moment of hope.</p><p>But in the face of his guilt, it disappears almost as quickly as it had come; so what if Luo Binghe no longer wanted his life? So what if Luo Binghe still cared for his shizun, in some form or the other, despite all of his hurt?</p><p>—What difference would it even make?</p><p>Shen Qingqiu had still shoved his blade into his chest—!</p><p>He had still kicked him down the abyss, watched him with cold eyes as he fell!</p><p>He’d been merciless, he’d been cruel.</p><p>In the end, <em> hadn't he still hurt his Binghe...? </em></p><p>And, even if Luo Binghe had turned out… a little different from what he’d expected him to, it didn’t necessarily mean that Luo Binghe had given up on his plans of exacting revenge. After all, Binghe had schemed and plotted his way just so he could ensure Shen Qingqiu’s captivity in Huan Hua’s Water Prison.</p><p>Going to such lengths to corner his shizun— wasn’t that just definitive proof of Luo Binghe’s vindictive vengeance and the resentment he held within, even if he didn’t want his shizun dead, even if he still <em> cared? </em> </p><p>And even on the off chance that all his guesses were horribly wrong and that Shen Qingqiu was horrendously and grievously mistaken about the intentions of his disciple, it also didn’t change the fact none of it would matter anyway, since Shen Qingqiu was still irrefutably, and most assuredly, on the last legs of his life. </p><p>After all, from what he can hazily remember, he’d probably spent an entire week or so passed out in a delirious, feverish state, struggling to wake while under Luo Binghe’s care. In his previous sickly life as Shen Yuan, this had only occurred towards the end of his lifespan— during the last few months prior to his death when he’d been so weak and overcome with pain he could only spend his days flitting in and out of consciousness.  </p><p>So then, why would any of these matter, when he was already living out his dying breaths?</p><p>Shen Qingqiu would still have to disappear anyway.</p><p>But still, for his illness to progress so quickly in the span of weeks…</p><p>A cold feeling creeps up on him, and Shen Qingqiu can’t stop a chilling thought from flickering into his mind.</p><p>
<em> …Exactly how much time does he have left…? </em>
</p><p>He swallows. </p><p>All of a sudden, the physical discomfort of his illness becomes all too obvious to ignore. The throbbing in his temples and the low-grade fever that has faded to a constant hum suddenly flares back to life; without so much as a warning, he is hyper aware of how the sheets of the bed clings uncomfortably onto his skin, how he’s all damp and sticky with cold sweat, and how the back of his throat is dry and parched. His eyelids feel crusted over, and he can acutely feel the wet pressure tickling in his lungs, feel the burning ache in his muscles, feel his illness devour every inch of his life as he sleeps away his days.</p><p>Then, it all happens in barely a second. As he struggles to breathe in his jumble of thoughts—</p><p>—Luo Binghe enters, carrying a wooden bucket filled with water and a cloth.</p><p>Shen Qingiqu’s breath halts.</p><p>Luo Binghe’s gaze is still fixed onto the wooden bucket as he makes his way into the room, but when he eventually turns from the door and looks up, in a flash of a second, their eyes interlock; molten red burning into silverish grey—</p><p>—and Luo Binghe stills.</p><p>And stares.</p><p>And stares, and stares.</p><p>And then, </p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p><em> “Shizun,” </em>he breathes.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p> </p><p>And before he can even blink, Luo Binghe is once again by his bedside. He clumsily settles the bucket down at the wooden table sitting in the middle of the room, quite literally throwing it down without paying any need to how the water sloshes around and spills messily out of the brim all over the table.</p><p>In his haste to rush over to Shen Qingqiu’s side, he stumbles and trips, and almost falls several times, but by the time Shen Qingqiu’s brain whirls back to life, Luo Binghe is already kneeling by his side, looking at him with such a desperate expression Shen Qingqiu feels his breath catch in his lungs. </p><p>“Shizun,” Luo Binghe breathes again.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu only continues staring mutedly.</p><p>“Shizun, Shizun,” he repeats, desperately, clutching onto his hand. <em> “</em>—<em>Shizun</em>.”</p><p>
<em> Binghe. </em>
</p><p>The sight of his disciple almost gives him a whiplash despite having seen him in the flesh sleeping by his side only yesterday. Binghe’s fingers feel like a smoldering warmth against his, burning and electric like the flames of a wildfire raging from within. </p><p><em> What kind of timing is this</em>, Shen Qingqiu winds up wondering breathlessly as he stares down at the blackened protagonist kneeling by his side. <em> This master was already struggling to breathe, and this is when you choose to appear? </em></p><p>He almost has half a mind to complain about the timing that Luo Binghe has chosen to appear, and the other half to instinctively berate his sticky disciple for being overly dramatic, but Binghe’s voice quivers when he calls out his name, and suddenly he finds that he’s no longer able to speak.</p><p>He’s confused, and stunned beyond belief by Binghe’s display of heartfelt emotions that is neither cynicism nor bitterness that he’s come to associate with his blackened protagonist. From the remnants of his memories of Binghe’s tender touches in his dreams, Shen Qingqiu is aware of how Luo Binghe still cares for him, or enough not to wish for his death, at the very least. </p><p>But <em> this</em>—<em>? </em> The extent of Binghe’s affection and relief at seeing him awake even with vengeance sitting at the forefront of his mind is something that Shen Qingqiu hadn’t expected in the slightest.</p><p>Nevertheless, they all take a backseat to the way Binghe makes him feel— how his breath leaves him in all but a flurry when he sees and hears Luo Binghe in the flesh after struggling for so long trying to reach him while still trapped in his dreams.</p><p>His finger twitches in Luo Binghe’s hold.</p><p>But it goes by unnoticed; Luo Binghe has his hands clasped over Shen Qingqiu’s own in a tight, desperate grip, and he presses his forehead against their interlaced hands. His hair, swept up into a ponytail, tickles lightly across Shen Qingqiu’s skin, and behind their clasped hand, Shen Qingqiu can see the wet shine in Luo Binghe’s eyes.</p><p><em> “Shizun,” </em>the heartbroken protagonist whispers again into their intertwined hands.</p><p>...From where he’s sitting, Shen Qingqiu can see the outline of Luo Binghe’s shoulder’s faintly trembling. He bites at his lips as if holding back desperate cries, hides and buries his face into their interwoven hands as if Shen Qingqiu is a precious, precious thing.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu’s heart softens.</p><p>And before he knows it, the words slip past his lips with a fondness seeping into his voice, and he replies—</p><p> </p><p align="center"><em> “ </em> —<em>Shizun is here.” </em></p><hr/><p>It takes a while, but the initial outpour of emotions eventually settles into a slightly calmer silence.</p><p>When Binghe finally looks up from their clasped hands to gaze at him, Shen Qingqiu sees himself reflected in Binghe’s eyes. It glitters and shines with wet tears much like the surface of a polished gem catching onto sunlight; the silhouette of himself is all that he sees and all that he is <em> able </em>to see in the deep red of his irises.</p><p>He’d carve out little gems made of his own heart if he could, to fill the cracks he’s made in his disciple’s. He thinks he’s slowly coming to understand the little displays of heartbreak that Binghe has inadvertently shown in his lashes of anger and quiet moments of desperation, understand how he’d left him with nothing when he’s everything and more in the world that Binghe sees reflected in his eyes.</p><p>And Shen Qingqiu can’t help but wonder—</p><p>If he stayed long enough by his side, would Binghe finally be free? </p><p>If he repented long enough, atoned earnestly enough, would Binghe be able to relinquish his desire for revenge and cast off his mantle of hate? See love for what it is, and embrace happiness when it comes?</p><p>But even if he didn’t, he hopes that his eventual death would still grant Binghe the cathartic release that he needs.</p><p>He hopes that his precious disciple would become nothing like that sad, bitter man he’d once read about in a book a long time back.</p><p>And he wonders if these are but the wishful longings of a man who dreams of things that would never come to pass. But despite everything, he still hopes that it does.</p><p>That person who holds his hand by his bedside—</p><p>—Shen Qingqiu hopes that he can be happy.</p><hr/><p>Of course, those are thoughts that Shen Qingqiu is in no way able to bring himself to even mention aloud. </p><p>Instead, he shoves it to the back of his mind, and lets it settle somewhere deep in a corner of his heart where it’s no longer at the forefront of his mind. There, it hurts just a little bit less, especially when Luo Binghe enters his field of vision and he’s inevitably reminded again of everything that he’s done and the things that will come to be. </p><p>But Luo Binghe almost <em> never </em> leaves his field of vision; in fact, his precious disciple stays right <em> there</em>, right before him, and lingers by his side much like the heavy weight of guilt and the dawning dread of the future that haunts him through all of his reality and all of his dreams.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu can’t <em> stop </em>himself from remembering. </p><p>Not when Luo Binghe, in all of his supposed anger and hate and desire for revenge, still cares, <em> so much</em>, for a Shizun who deserved none of it.</p><p>He had been subtly aware of it when he’d still been lingering somewhere on the edge in between his dreams and his consciousness— of Binghe’s tender touches, of his comforting warmth.</p><p>But to see all of these with his very own eyes feels like a completely different experience altogether, and the sheer tenderness that shows in his every action is enough to leave him reeling in a whirlwind of his emotions.</p><p>“...Shizun?”</p><p>Shen Qingqiu blinks, eyes shifting to the blackened protagonist standing faithfully by his bedside. He feels like he’s suffocating in his own lungs, crumbling under the weight of his own guilt and adoration for the man who deserves everything and more than what he could give.</p><p>The rims of Luo Binghe’s eyes are still tinged red, and he gazes at him like Shen Qingqiu alone holds the answers to all of his questions. Despite him not saying anything, beneath his questioning gaze, Shen Qingqiu can see the smoldering heat in his eyes burning like molten embers when he looks at him.</p><p>“This master is feeling fine,” Shen Qingqiu sighs placatingly. He’s sitting upright still tucked away under the covers of the sheets, where Binghe had gently leaned him to rest against the headboard of the bed and folded the quilts neatly around his hip in an effort to ensure that he wouldn’t go cold. </p><p>“Just a little tired,” he explains, “Binghe need not worry.”</p><p>His tongue feels numb coated with the lies that spill from his lips, but he really doesn’t know where to begin unravelling his tangled ball of emotions— or which of it he should pick apart for Luo Binghe to see.</p><p>Would it even make a difference, if he bared his soul after all that he’s done?  </p><p>But even after his reassurance, Luo Binghe only continues staring at him with an immovable expression. He stands by his bedside almost like a rigid block of wood, entirely silent and still, and Shen Qingqiu can’t help but wonder what Luo Binghe sees when he looks at him. </p><p>What did he see <em> in </em>this shizun of his, who had all but tossed him into the gates of hell, that he would still remain faithfully by his side to care for him, even when he’d hurt him so?</p><p>But Luo Binghe’s expression remains unreadable. His eyes flicker to Shen Qingqiu, before it darts back down to gaze at the sheets of the bed.</p><p>Between the two of them, there is a long lull of silence, and it takes a long while before he finally speaks—</p><p>“Then, this disciple will brew you some tea,” he says, softly. “Shizun must be feeling thirsty.”</p><p>Coincidentally, there is a tea set sitting conveniently on top of another small wooden table at a far corner of the room. On second thought, it probably isn’t as coincidental and convenient as Shen Qingqiu had initially thought it to be— for all its purposes and intentions, Luo Binghe must have brought the tea set over for when Shen Qingqiu woke up. </p><p>Then, Luo Binghe very gently pushes the teacup into his hands, and Shen Qingqiu immediately feels the warmth of the tea seeping into the tips of his fingers through porcelain glass. The heat he feels spreading from his fingertips immediately brings him a rush of relief; he’d been feeling much colder in a way he hadn’t realised he’d been.</p><p>“Shizun should take care to drink it only in small sips,” Luo Binghe murmurs, breath ghosting lightly over his skin as he leans over. Their fingers brush lightly across each other when Luo Binghe hands him the tea, and for a moment, Shen Qingqiu briefly remembers the way Binghe’s hands had felt interlaced with his.</p><p>“Or would Shizun prefer to drink something else?”</p><p>Shen Qingqiu shakes himself out of his stupor. He allows a fond smile to graze past his lips as he accepts the tea, and completely misses the way how Luo Binghe immediately stills and proceeds to stare at him with wide eyes in astonished wonder.</p><p>“No need,” Shen Qingqiu replies gratefully, “this is plenty.”</p><p>And it was.</p><p>Binghe’s tea-brewing skills were still as perfect as ever, the same as the ones he remembers in his memories of warm, pleasant days, the same as the ones he’d drank when he’d still been locked up in a desolate, cold prison of grey hues and isolated solitude— only to watch his days pass blurrily with barely a recognition of the time that had passed.</p><p>But nevertheless, the tea is perfectly warm, and brewed to just the right flavour; a clear honey amber that he’s grown fond of ever since he’d transmigrated into this lifetime.</p><p>He drinks it indulgently, savouring every sip that passes his lips, relishing in the aftertaste it leaves on his tongue. And throughout it all, once his initial astonishment subsided, Luo Binghe stands diligently by his side, in a fashion painfully reminiscent of the past.</p><p>The way he hovers silently and worriedly over such a simple act as drinking tea, making sure that Shen Qingqiu only took little sips of it and drank the tea only in small amounts— for some reason, those silent, little acts of care only made the tea taste that much sweeter, and in the sweetness of the moment it is hard not to notice how the warmth of the tea feels very much similar to Binghe’s.</p><p>But despite this, Shen Qingqiu also notices— how Luo Binghe falls into silence as he stands by his bedside. The words that leave his lips are soft and muted, like he’s afraid that anything louder than a whisper would shatter this ephemeral dream of his and steal his shizun away from him.</p><p>He’s really only spoken for a total of two times ever since he’d regained his composure after seeing his shizun awake and fully conscious; once while helping him lean against the headboard of the bed, and the other to brew him tea.</p><p>Both of those instances were acts of services, of a worried disciple tending to his shizun in a show of filial piety. And the way Luo Binghe had tended to him with such attentiveness, it is almost impossible to miss the care and thinly veiled worry in his tender touches and furrowed brows. </p><p>But it is… starkly different from what Shen Qingqiu is used to. </p><p>Back in the past, whenever Binghe had tended to him or prepared him tea or served him his meals, he’d always stood by his side with an easy familiarity and an adoring smile etched onto his face.</p><p>He’d gazed up at him every single time, and as the years passed, he had grown into his height until he eventually came up to Shen Qingqiu’s and could finally look him in the eye without having to crane his neck up or stand on his tippy toes. And in all of those instances Shen Qingqiu had seen how bright Luo Binghe’s world had been when reflected from his eyes. </p><p>And even after crawling out of the abyss, even when Shen Qingqiu had been trapped in the water prison, Binghe had never really stayed silent. He’d spoken of his anger and of his hurt, and lashed out in equal parts vindictiveness and equal parts grief. He’d asked many questions, and spoke of many things. With hate fuelled by grief, he had chased endlessly for answers.</p><p>But now, Luo Binghe refuses to speak, nor look him in the eye. </p><p>Instead, the moment he’d ensured that his sickly shizun wouldn’t choke himself to death drinking tea, the blackened protagonist’s eyes flicker back to the sheets of the bed, turning his head downcast and clenching his fists by his side.</p><p>He remains silent for a long, long while, and keeps his gaze fixated onto the sheets, even after Shen Qingqiu has finished the tea. He’s pretty sure that the pot of tea sitting on the desk by his bedside has gone cold by now, despite him only having drank a single cup of it. But Luo Binghe still remains tight-lipped, even when Shen Qingqiu had tilted his head to stare at him questioningly.</p><p>Luo Binghe remaining silent isn’t so much of a problem compared to how he <em> looks </em>while doing it; he bites at his lips and trembles where he stands, as if he’s hesitant to even speak.</p><p>The way he looks sends a sharp stab of pain through Shen Qingqiu’s heart; he only wishes he could turn back time and re-do everything from the start. </p><p>This time, he would gently cup Luo Binghe’s heart in the palm of his hands.</p><p>He would shower it with love, and do everything right.</p><p>He will hide Binghe’s heart away in the recesses of his own, shield it from turbulent storms and the cruel whims of the world and the system, if it meant that Luo Binghe would never look like all of his suffering was his and his alone to bear in this world.</p><p>But Shen Qingqiu knows, with a startling clarity, that miracles will most likely never happen as long as you wish for it to. He already has two entire lifetimes worth of experience, what more evidence would he need? Even in his second life in a world filled with cultivation, he was still ill, and even his unsealed spiritual qi was useless in the face of his illness that has settled deep into his bones.</p><p>So, instead of hoping for what could never come to be, Shen Qingqiu chooses to wait.</p><p>He waits, setting his empty teacup by his side.</p><p>He waits, folding his palms over his lap.</p><p>He waits, patiently, tirelessly, and fixes his gaze on Luo Binghe as he struggles to speak—</p><p>—until he eventually does.</p><p>His voice is but a soft murmur in the silence of the room. Shen Qingqiu has to strain his ears to listen, but when he does, and hears the words that spill from Binghe’s lips, his entire world comes to a standstill, and lingers where it stops.</p><p>Very quietly, and very guilty, Luo Binghe’s speaks without even looking up from the sheets of the bed.</p><p>“—Shizun,” he whispers, falteringly, “Shizun, you could have called for me—" he halts, voice shaky, and breathes, "this disciple would— would have—”</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">—<em>This disciple would have given anything if you’d asked. </em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>His lashes, dark and long, sweep across his cheekbones when he stares resolutely at the bed. Yet, Shen Qingqiu can still see how it trembles and flutters fleetingly over his skin, see the jagged shards of his emotions reflected in the mosaic of his eyes, beautiful and gimmering red hidden beneath a thick curtain of lashes.</p><p>Luo Binghe does not continue to speak any further than that. </p><p>His words dies at the tip of his tongue, and it settles into a quiet reticence between the two of them.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">…Much later in the future, Shen Qingqiu will look back upon this time.</p><p align="center">It is only then, that he will come to realise the weight of Luo Binghe’s words.</p><hr/><p>But Shen Qingqiu lives in the present.</p><p>He always has, ever since he’d been Shen Yuan.</p><p>It didn’t come as naturally to him as it did some others, but eventually, over time, he’d gotten used to it. Which was unsurprising, mainly because he’s had a lot of practice, and the fact that he <em> had </em>to. It was dire for him in the way it hadn’t been for many others— with his illness eating away at him, time was something he didn’t have the luxury of possessing. He really only had so much of it to spare. </p><p>Besides, his life already had so little meaning as it is, with him spending a literal half of his life being cooped up all alone in his hospital ward, and the other half being too debilitated by his illness he couldn’t even move. If he’d squandered what’s left of his life uselessly worrying about things that had happened in the past or the things that would come to be in the future, rather than to live in the <em> now</em>, then wouldn’t that truly be a waste of his meagre life?</p><p>So Shen Qingqiu tries his absolute best not to think about it; about the way Luo Binghe had looked when Shen Qingqiu had remained silent even after he’d asked his question, about how Luo Binghe <em> will </em>look when he eventually finds out about Shen Qingqiu’s impending death. </p><p>The way Luo Binghe had reacted when he’d seen him finally awake, it is easy to tell that he’s completely placed his resentment and anger behind him in favour of dealing with Shen Qingqiu’s steadily declining health.</p><p>And now that he's no longer masking his emotions behind a layer of hostility, Shen Qingqiu can see the regard the blackened protagonist still holds for him; see the affection and concern laced into each of his every move and all of the hesitant words that leaves his lips, see how Luo Binghe had <em> never once </em>thought of his shizun as any <em>less</em>, even after the abyss.</p><p>It is easy to tell how <em> much </em> Luo Binghe still <em> cares</em>. </p><p>And it is because of all these, that Shen Qingqiu is fairly sure that he will end up hurting his precious disciple all over again when he eventually leaves him behind.</p><p>He tries not to think about how Binghe’s face will twist when he learns about his death. He tries even harder not to wonder if it will look any similar to the heartbroken disbelief Binghe had worn when he’d pushed him into the abyss back then.</p><p>But when he focuses on his now, all he sees is Luo Binghe standing before him, with an equally heart wrenching expression on his face. It’s a fleeting one; his expression falls just the slightest bit at Shen Qingqiu’s silence, and it happens all so fast that Shen Qingqiu wouldn’t have noticed it if he hadn’t been staring closely at his disciple.</p><p>But it disappears almost as quickly as it had come; the initial hurt disappointment on Luo Binghe’s face flickers and fades, and he smooths his expression back into a carefully blank facade not a second later. It’s a look that is befitting of the stallion protagonist; entirely unreadable and distant, and suddenly, the image of the blackened protagonist of the original PIDW with his aloof and chilly countenance overlaps with the image of his heartbroken disciple in his mind. </p><p>Yet, even then, they still feel all too different.</p><p>As the day passes Shen Qingqiu finds himself seeing more sides to his own blackened sheep that the original never had; sees the various shades of his anger and the muddy hues of his sadness, sees the brilliance of what’s left of his affection and care for his shizun shining softly through all of his bitterness.</p><p>He’s slowly starting to think that maybe, just <em> maybe, </em>his blackened sheep might not be entirely the same as the cruel protagonist he’d read about after all. The more he thinks about it, the harder it is to reconcile the image of the blackened protagonist with the Luo Binghe who had stumbled his way over to his shizun and clutched tightly onto his hand just half a shichen back.  </p><p>But for some reason, his blackened sheep looks entirely unsurprised by Shen Qingqiu’s silence— even though Shen Qingqiu had seen how he’d tensed his shoulders as he awaited an answer that he knew would never come, even though he’d noticed how Luo Binghe had casted his eyes downwards and bitten at his lips as if awaiting an inevitable rejection and readying himself to be cast aside. </p><p>Luo Binghe only continues staring at the sheets of the bed as if he’s already expected this entire turn of events, and knew long beforehand that Shen Qingqiu would not deign to respond.</p><p>It hurts, for some reason that Shen Qingqiu is unable to place a finger on.</p><p>The way that Luo Binghe had reacted, much like earlier when he’d just woken up, was the exact opposite of what he’d expected.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu is more than familiar with his mocking jeers and accusatory jabs, his disdainful sneers and oppressive cynicism. He’s received his fair share of them, and witnessed firsthand Binghe’s occasional lashes of anger and how he’d laughed bitterly whenever Shen Qingqiu had chosen to remain silent.</p><p>But now, he can’t help but think that all of them were just a front; a defensive wall he’s put up to veil all of his sadness and how vulnerable he actually is when he’s before Shen Qingqiu.</p><p>But this time, Luo Binghe barely says much of a word.</p><p>Instead, he only lets out a shaky exhale, and stiffly unclenches his fists by his side.</p><p>“This disciple understands,” he murmurs, softly. He slowly trails his eyes up from the sheets to meet his gaze, and Shen Qingqiu can see the complicated swirl of emotions in his eyes. “Shizun need not force himself to answer. It’s—” he breathes, “—okay. This disciple understands.”</p><p>And Shen Qingqiu immediately wonders; what did Luo Binghe understand?</p><p>What had he understood, when Shen Qingqiu wasn’t even able to understand it himself?</p><p>What answer had Luo Binghe come to, when he’d looked into his eyes?</p><p>If he could understand that tangled ball of emotions in his heart, then did he know— how much he cared? How much he’d regretted? How much he wishes to give him all that he could, and let him know he’s more than precious that what he thinks he is, more than dear to him than anything else in this world?</p><p>His emotions swell and clogs up at his chest. </p><p>It’s suffocating. </p><p>If only he’d just never listened to the system from the start—!</p><p>What was the point, if he was going to die anyway? He’d traded Binghe’s entire lifetime of happiness and easy contentment for a measly few years of his own, of which he would end up spending lying worthlessly on his deathbed struggling with an illness that didn’t even belong to this world.</p><p>And even when he eventually revives in his plant body, who is to say he that wouldn’t come down with his illness again? If his sickness could even affect an immortal cultivator’s body like Shen Qingqiu’s, then what more a plant?</p><p>Would his illness cause him to rot away at an even faster rate, then?</p><p>Would he feel the pain more acutely, feel his body give up on him again and <em> again?</em></p><p>Would it even be worth it to struggle for his life, if he’s going to amount to nothing in the end…?</p><p>But Shen Qingqiu can’t help wanting to live. </p><p>When he looks down at his hands, he can see the paleness of his skin. Beneath them he sees his veins. It is filled with life.</p><p>When he stays silent, he can feel how his heart beats softly in his chest. It's a clear, beautiful cadence that resounds from within, steady thumps that lulls him into a soothing sleep. </p><p>When Binghe walks across the room, he can hear the soft creaking of the wooden floorboards ringing delightfully in his ears.</p><p>Every breath that he takes fills his lungs sweetly, and every brightly-coloured sight that he sees makes him stare just a little longer.</p><p>And when Binghe stands before him, his world lightens up just the slightest bit brighter, and his skin tingles delightfully with warmth whenever he holds his hand.</p><p>Being alive feels almost painfully sweet.</p><p>It fills Shen Qingqiu with a torrid desire to <em> live</em>, and he can’t help but chase endlessly after it.</p><p>He only wishes he had never stole Binghe’s happiness and traded it for his own.</p><p>He spends a while sitting on the bed lost in his thoughts, drowning in a sea of remorse and adoration for his disciple that he’s hurt in exchange for his own selfish desires. He feels like he’s on a flimsy boat sinking in the midst of a turbulent storm of his emotions.</p><p>In the depths of his guilt he loses track of time, and doesn’t notice how Luo Binghe continues staring at him for a little while longer, before seemingly coming to reach a conclusion— leaving him to his thoughts and slipping out of the room, only to come back in mere moments later.</p><p>When Luo Binghe speaks up again, his voice reverberates in the room with a startling clarity, bringing him out of his reverie. And when Shen Qingqiu turns to look, his heart drops in his chest, and he immediately forgets everything that he’d been turning over in his mind— in favour of the familiar wooden brown that has appeared before him while he’d been distracted by his thoughts.</p><p>“This…” Luo Binghe begins, his voice trailing off unsurely. </p><p>He stands a distance away from the bed where Shen Qingqiu’s been lying on, clutching at the bamboo tray in his hands, seemingly having just returned after fetching a bowl of congee from the kitchens in the time while Shen Qingqiu had been mulling over his thoughts. </p><p>The sight of the snowy white congee is so familiar that it feels like punch to his gut; the painful pang of nostalgia, the sweet lingering aftertaste of fonder memories, the sheer trepidation and welling dread churning in his stomach—</p><p>“This disciple understands that Shizun may not have an appetite so soon after waking up,” Luo Binghe begins, looking awkwardly out of place as he stands in between the wooden table and the bed, not knowing whether to settle the tray by Shen Qingqiu’s bedside or on the wooden table in the middle of the room. He pauses tentatively, clutching at that accursed bamboo tray in his hands, “but Shizun should eat, nevertheless.”</p><p><em> No, </em> he thinks, almost reflexively as he stares at the bowl of congee sitting atop the bamboo tray held in Binghe’s hands.</p><p>
<em> No. I can’t.  </em>
</p><p>He can feel the ghostly pangs of pain stabbing through his stomach at the memories the sight of the congee brings. He remembers how he’d hurled in the water prison, and all the other times he’d choked on his own spit and bile in his previous life.</p><p>He can’t help but fixate on the congee, on every single grain of rice that sits in that porcelain bowl. On how disgustingly green the chopped scallions look sprinkled all over the top, and how the mere <em> sight </em>of it makes him want to puke.</p><p>Luo Binghe visibly falters where he stands at Shen Qingqiu’s lack of response. His expression twists, and he only manages to take a small step forward before he pauses hesitantly where he stands. “...Would Shizun...require assistance…?”</p><p>“—This master isn’t hungry,” Shen Qingqiu immediately cuts in, eyes still transfixed onto the congee. His words come out a little sharp in the face of his dread, and in the far-off corner of his mind, he thinks he might have heard a stilted, sharp inhale coming from Luo Binghe’s side.</p><p>But he pays it no need, because all that he can <em> see, </em>is the deceptively innocent looking bowl of congee sitting atop the tray, so glaringly white as it stares back at him. He sees flashes of his memories of him hurling onto a cold prison ground blazing past his mind, hears the mocking peals of laughter and the distant echoes of his regurgitation ringing in his ears, resounding in his hollowed-out mind.</p><p>He’s not entirely sure how long he’d spent fixating on the congee and blatantly ignoring the protagonist standing right before him, but eventually, the silence becomes too stifling for him to ignore, and Shen Qingqiu glances up—</p><p>—and regret immediately floods his heart.</p><p>Luo Binghe looks heartbroken all over again.</p><p>He doesn’t know <em> why</em>, exactly, when all he’d done was say that he wasn’t hungry. It shouldn’t have caused such a look to appear on Luo Binghe’s face, especially since Shen Qingqiu’s pretty sure Luo Binghe still resents him for everything that he’s done.</p><p>Sure, he might still be concerned over his shizun’s health.</p><p>Sure, he might not want his shizun dead.</p><p>But still, Shen Qingqiu knows such wounds could never be erased and forgotten as easily as that; it will carve itself an armor of hatred and resentment, make a forever home in your heart, so that you may never truly forget.</p><p>But Luo Binghe is still standing stiffly in the middle of the wooden table and the bed. He hasn’t moved an inch since the moment he’d spoken and snapped Shen Qingqiu out of his spiral of thoughts, but his arms tremble, just a little, as he holds onto the bamboo tray. </p><p>The lines of his lips are pressed together tightly, and tilted just the slightest bit downwards at the corners. It quivers slightly, but Luo Binghe forcibly holds himself back— and Shen Qingqiu can see how his throat bobs as he swallows down his emotions.</p><p><em> You’ve hurt him again, </em> he thinks. <em> You do it all so easily, don’t you? Hurting others for your own sake. </em></p><p>It’s a cold, dark feeling that gnaws at him.</p><p>
<em> What a selfish, selfish man you are. </em>
</p><p>That sad, dejected look on Luo Binghe— Shen Qingqiu wonders how many times he had caused that look on his face.</p><p>It must have been far too many to count, he thinks.</p><p>“Binghe may place it on the table,” Shen Qingqiu relents eventually, forcing down his rising nausea.</p><p>His voice sounds distant even to his own ears at the sheer dread that courses through his veins at the thought of eating and having to go through the entire process of regurgitation— at the thought of being helpless and weak in an unfamiliar place teeming with cultivators who resented him for the things they believed he’s done.</p><p>But Binghe's heartbroken expression remains vividly imprinted in his mind. </p><p>So Shen Qingqiu swallows down the lump in his throat, and wrangles his internal panic into submission—</p><p>—He'll eat it. </p><p>It's the least he could do. </p><p>He’s gone through this many times before, he can do it again. He’ll do it as many times as he needs to, if it means that Luo Binghe will never have to look like that again. </p><p>So, with grim determination, he struggles pitifully as he tries to crawl out from under the covers of the bed, and almost falls over in his attempt to do so. But once again, Luo Binghe is by his side, and catches him by his waist mid-fall. In a split second while he’d been struggling to even get off the bed, his blackened sheep had already placed the tray on the wooden table and scuttled over worriedly to help him up.</p><p>And when his vision eventually clears, the first thing that Shen Qingqiu sees is how his face is almost plastered to Luo Binghe’s chest, with his disciple’s arms wrapped loosely around his waist, curling at his hip to support his weight.</p><p>Immediately, a heated flush spreads lightly across his cheeks, and his heavy dread  along with his depressive mood immediately disappears at the sheer embarrassment that rushes through his blood.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu lets out a huff.</p><p>Really, he was no invalid! He could totally walk; he was just out of practice! It’s totally normal to fall after being bed-ridden for weeks, he’ll be fine walking on his own if Binghe had just given him a little more time. He’ll be walking on his own two feet right after this, you’ll see!</p><p>Blushing embarrassedly, Shen Qingqiu coughs lightly, and pushes at Luo Binghe’s chest. “Much thanks,” he murmurs. “This master is fine, Binghe has no need to look at me like that.”</p><p>Binghe hovers beside him, brows pulling into a worried frown. “This disciple can help Shizun there,” he argues, and remains rooted exactly where he stands as if Shen Qingqiu batting at his chest for space was mere light cat slaps.</p><p>“Shizun is still recuperating from his fever. It is best if Shizun does not exert too much strength.”</p><p>“...” Shen Qingqiu says, feeling suffocated in Luo Binghe’s embrace.</p><p><em> The stallion protagonist eats steroids for breakfast, lunch and dinner, </em> he bemoans, almost hysterical at the close proximity of their bodies, and how he was only a mere inch away from burying his face into Luo Binghe’s chest. He can’t help but feel slightly affronted at how Binghe barely notices him pushing at his chest, and how his palm tingles from his light smacks. <em> Those muscles aren’t normal. I call fraud.  </em></p><p>Nevertheless, he relents, and eventually succeeds in meandering his way over to the wooden table in the middle of the room with Luo Binghe’s help. Luo Binghe lingers closely by his side throughout it all, and it only adds on to Shen Qingqiu’s perplexed confusion at his disciple’s stickiness. </p><p>But when he sees the bowl of congee sitting on the table before him, it all dissipates into nothingness. That familiar nausea rises up in his chest again, and Shen Qingqiu has to stifle down a grimace.</p><p>He proceeds to place small spoonfuls of the congee slowly into his mouth; every bite of the congee he takes settles like lead in his stomach, but the nostalgic flavour still bursts across his tongue. He still loves the way it tastes; how the rice is fluffy and soft when he swallows it down, how the sweetness of the congee permeates his taste buds, the complexity to the simpleness of the flavours that lingers on his tongue.</p><p>Yet all those are not enough to wrestle down his psychological dread towards eating, now that he knows for sure how his body will react. But Binghe stares at him with wide, hopeful eyes, in a manner that Shen Qingqiu hasn’t seen on his disciple in a long, long while.</p><p>So he eats, and mechanically swallows spoonful and after spoonful of Binghe’s congee.</p><p>When he finishes it eventually, Luo Binghe is still standing faithfully by his side. He stares at the empty bowl in almost wonder, as if he’s unable to believe that his shizun had really eaten it clean, and Shen Qingqiu can't help but feel a little self-conscious; he'd finished the entire bowl of congee when he'd said that he hadn't been hungry— it seems a little all too ridiculous, now that he thinks about it. </p><p>“What is Binghe staring at?” Shen Qingqiu asks, with as much aloof nonchalance as he could possibly muster in his attempt to retain his dignity. “Did Binghe not bring this bowl of congee over so this master could eat?”</p><p>Luo Binghe startles, snapping out of his trance, and lifts his gaze to meet Shen Qingqiu’s eyes. His demonic marks glows softly on his forehead, and Shen Qingqiu distantly wonders if Binghe’s ever self-conscious about it, of how that single mark made him different from everyone else.</p><p>“This— Pardon this disciple for his inattentiveness,” Luo Binghe apologises, eyes slowly trailing back to fixate on the empty bowl of congee. “This disciple just… didn't expect that Shizun would really eat it...”</p><p>And then Shen Qingqiu feels his heart breaking all over again.</p><p>He remembers all the time he’s refused Binghe’s food while he’d still been in the water prison.</p><p>He remembers how he’d barely given it a glance, remembers how often Binghe had tediously cooked for him throughout the day, brought him all of his favourite food, tried over and over again just so Shen Qingqiu would eat— only to have thrown it all out in the end.</p><p>“...This master will eat whatever Binghe prepares for him,” he promises quietly after a moment of silence, looking over at his disciple who has long since believed himself to be undeserving of love and anything good, who had been proven time and time again by the cruelty of the world that he’s as unworthy as he thought himself to be when it is anything but the truth. </p><p>Then, it dawns upon him exactly what he’s just said— and he promptly shoves his subsequent rising horror to the back of his mind. </p><p>He can scream about his own atrociously poor life choices later when he’s alone, he decides. </p><p>Binghe’s head snaps back up at his words, and he looks at him so astonishedly like he’s given him the world, and Shen Qingqiu immediately feels nervous at the intensity of his gaze.</p><p>“What of the trial?” He asks instead, swiftly changing the subject before Luo Binghe could say anything further. “The Old Palace Master must surely be upset about this, I can imagine. Did Binghe convince him to postpone the trial?”</p><p>Luo Binghe’s eyes flicker, and his expression shifts. It settles into one of poorly concealed disdain, one so familiar to Shen Qingqiu that he ends up staring at his disciple for a little while longer. </p><p>“Shizun need not concern himself with the Old Palace Master,” Luo Binghe clips impatiently, curling his lips into a sneer, “or any of Huan Hua Sect’s disciples, for that matter. This disciple will handle everything, including the trial. Shizun only needs to focus on recuperating here.”</p><p>The way Luo Binghe had phrased his words, suddenly he’s the blackened protagonist all over again, the one that Shen Qingqiu had read about in a book once upon a time. He recognises the danger this Luo Binghe exudes; the simmering threat of anger laced under his skin and the cunning schemes he has ready at his fingertips.</p><p>“And the Little Palace Mistress…?” Shen Qingqiu asks carefully.</p><p>Luo Binghe scowls. “Dealt with.”</p><p>Shen Qingqiu is almost afraid to ask. </p><p>He stares at Luo Binghe with his palms folded over in his lap, unsure of what to say. He can’t help but wonder if he’d indirectly caused the death of a little girl through the hands of the protagonist he’d blackened.</p><p>Trading the life of a little girl who still had a bright future ahead of her, for the superficial wounds of a dying man who has already lived two lifetimes— wasn’t that a little too extreme…? </p><p>It's an unsettling thought that feels slightly different from the guilt that eats away at him whenever he looks at his precious disciple, but nevertheless it still leaves him with an unease that he's unable to shake off. </p><p>“Did Shizun think this disciple killed her?” Luo Binghe’s voice cuts through the fog that is his thoughts, sharp and clear.</p><p>When he looks back up, Luo Binghe’s expression is unreadable again, and he gazes at him with a searing intensity, vermillion red staring straight into his soul. And again, his fists are clenched by his side, and Shen Qingqiu can see how the muscles of his shoulders are pulled in a taut line. </p><p>“This…” he begins cautiously, feeling like he’s treading in dangerous waters, waiting for Binghe to snap like how he'd done those previous few times when their conversations had gone awry.</p><p>“—I didn’t.”</p><p>Shen Qingqiu blinks.</p><p>Luo Binghe’s answer comes out so unexpectedly fast that it takes Shen Qingqiu by surprise. It sounds stilted and jerky, like he’d rushed to get his answer out for fear that Shen Qingqiu would think badly of him.</p><p>“Shizun, this disciple—” Luo Binghe falters, and tries again. “This disciple—” He bites at his lip, furrows his brows, and pauses.</p><p>“Shizun has always disliked needless bloodshed,” he rephrases instead, stiffly, “so this disciple has never planned on hurting anyone—” </p><p>—<em>or you. </em></p><p>But of course, Shen Qingqiu does not hear how his sentence trails off in his mind. He can only see how Luo Binghe looks desperate as he stares at him, how the tense lines of his shoulders and the clenched fists by his side that he’d actually thought to be anger were actually fear and desperation bundled up in one.</p><p>Contrary to his expectations, Binghe's response is nothing like the possible scenarios that he's played out in his mind. In fact, it was the exact opposite.</p><p>But it grants him relief, nevertheless, that his disciple hadn’t actually killed a young girl for his dying master who had all but tossed him into hell. He’s not entirely sure how much he can believe the words of his blackened protagonist, but he finds that he <em> wants </em>to believe that the hesitant words he hears from his disciple is nothing but the truth, that the warmth of that hand that holds his own by his bedside is real.</p><p>“Alright,” he says simply, the unsettling discomfort in his gut fading away. “If Binghe says so.”</p><p>Luo Binghe blinks, and his next words that he’d been ready to throw out in an attempt to convince Shen Qingqiu dies at the tip of his tongue.</p><p>“Shizun… believes me?” He asks disbelievingly, eyes wide, as if he’s unable to comprehend how the situation has unfolded. “...Just like that?”</p><p>“What more does Binghe want?” Shen Qingqiu asks back, dearly wishing for a fan to hide his face with how intensely Binghe is staring at him. “This master’s word is all I can give.”</p><p>Silence reigns for a moment or two.</p><p>Then—</p><p>A soft smile spreads across Luo Binghe’s face.</p><p>And Shen Qingqiu is immediately rooted to his seat.</p><p>The smile flourishes across his lips, lights up his face dearly like sweet sunshine glowing on his skin. It’s a small, tiny smile— barely noticeable unless you squint, but it’s there, on the face of his disciple that he’s pushed into the hell who had crawled out dragging the shattered remains of his heart with his bloody fingers sharpened into claws. It’s there, on  the disciple he’s hurt with his own two hands, on the disciple who he’d thought he would never be able to see smiling again.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu is starstruck. </p><p>He stops breathing entirely as he looks at Luo Binghe, with the dark curls of his hair framing his face and falling over the broad cut of his shoulders, with the mark of his demonic sigil glowing a soft red on his forehead. He suddenly feels like he’s seeing Luo Binghe for the first time all over again, in all his glory and charm of a stallion protagonist and the sweetness of a white lotus he’d once used to be. </p><p>And when he eventually realises how he’d been holding his breath, he lets it all out in a sharp exhale— as if he’s completely forgotten how to breathe. He has to try several times to get it right, with conscious and deliberate breaths in order to get his world moving again.</p><p>But before he’s even able to do it right, Luo Binghe speaks up again.</p><p>“Shizun’s word is all this disciple needs,” he replies softly and agreeingly. Dark lashes sweep over iridescent red, and the way that Luo Binghe looks— content and serene like he’s finally managed to find a small piece of happiness for himself, one that he could treasure and keep all for himself— Shen Qingqiu’s heart twists, and he finds himself unable to respond.</p><p>His words are completely lodged in his throat. </p><p>He doesn’t exactly know what he’s feeling, or why he suddenly feels like his entire world has somehow clicked into place like broken pieces of a puzzle fitting together. But Luo Binghe— Luo Binghe remains standing right beside him, before the windowsills of the room.</p><p>In Shen Qingqiu’s eyes, he’s basked in the soft golden streams of the afternoon sun. </p><p>The wind tousles his hair, sweeps across the hems of his robes.</p><p>He is completely unable to tear his eyes away.</p><p>But he must have stayed silent for far too long; Luo Binghe’s voice resounds again in his ears, snapping him out of his trance. “Then,” he says, almost fondly, and Shen Qingqiu’s breath stutters again, “this disciple will excuse himself to go fetch some medicine. Shizun can rest in the meanwhile.”</p><p>Binghe’s tone is light, even though it’s nothing compared to the lively eagerness of the white lotus he’d once been in his past. </p><p>But for some reason, Shen Qingqiu finds that it fills his heart with warmth, and makes him think, for just the slightest bit, that everything will be alright.<br/>

<p>Shen Qingqiu eventually wakes up to a stifling midday heat.</p><p>The glare of the afternoon sun streaks across his skin in golden waves of warmth, lights it aflame with a tingling afternoon heat. His cheeks flushes where the sun traces along it; the sticky, smothering warmth trickling in from the openings of the windows lingering just above his heated skin.</p><p>It’s hot enough that Shen Qingqiu stirs in his sleep.</p><p>Behind closed eyes, if he focuses just the slightest bit more, he can hear the light chirping of the songbirds outside; a soothing, melodious tone humming softly at the back of his mind. In his memories, they sound very much like the lilting chimes of the songbirds that he remembers hearing in the early mornings of his Qing Jing Peak while he’s still spread out lazily under his sheets, warm and comfortable and still hazy with sleep.</p><p>Amidst the silvery tunes of the birdsong airy trills, he can also hear a series of dull, muted thumps against wood, and the familiar light clatter of porcelain dishwares clinking against each other.</p><p>His mind fixates on it even while he’s still asleep—</p><p>—It’s an oddly nostalgic sound.</p><p>It’s almost as if he’s heard these exact same muffled sounds before, a very long time ago. Waking up to the chirping of the songbirds, to the sound of dishwares being settled and arranged onto the table, rousing him gently from his sleep— why did it feel all so familiar…?</p><p>Shen Qingqiu’s mind prickles, and slowly, he flutters his eyes open.</p><p>The first thing he sees, is the blinding glare of the sun through his lashes. </p><p>Then, the soft bamboo brown of the ceiling flits into view, and when his vision finally adjusts to the brightness of daylight and he turns his head to look, he sees Luo Binghe standing at the wooden table in the middle of the room, with his back turned to him.</p><p>He’s currently settling the porcelain plates onto the table, and over the edges of it Shen Qingqiu peeks a glimpse of what he assumes is supposedly his lunch. A ceramic pot of herbal soup sits in the middle of the table, the light, earthy fragrance of freshly simmered chicken wafting over to the corners of the room. </p><p>Driven with focus, Luo Binghe seemingly does not notice that he is awake. He single-mindedly plates the dishes and carefully arranges them onto the table, occasionally even nudging at it with a pair of chopsticks, shifting it into a more visually appealing arrangement.</p><p>It’s an oddly endearing set of actions that brings a slight curve to Shen Qingqiu’s lips when he watches his disciple from the back.</p><p>Fondly amused, he parts his lips with all the intention of calling for his disciple, who has somehow still managed to retain the tiny pieces of that adorable little sheep he’d once been, and maybe even tease him for his unexpected fussiness over small, little inconsequential details such as this. </p><p>But before he even manages to vocalise his thoughts, a sudden wave of nausea ripples through him— sharp and cutting.</p><p>Immediately, Shen Qingqiu lets out a muffled groan, and snaps his eyelids shut.</p><p>Like a rippling tide, the nausea wrings his breath away, swirls around unforgivingly in his chest. Vertigo sings its vicious rhapsody, and Shen Qingqiu can feel it spilling into his lungs, into every flutter of breath he takes.</p><p>There’s a familiar, painful cramp in his abdomen, that same sickening twist that feels like a sharp tendril of pain contorting in his belly. Even after closing his eyes, his entire world still feels like it’s spinning tumultuously on its axis; a sea of black spiralling and whirling much like the coil of nausea in his chest.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu bites at his lip, smothering down his pain, and a small, little noise slips out from the back of his throat. It comes out as a barely there whimper, barely noticeable even in the silence of the room, but Shen Qingqiu immediately hears the muted thump of the bamboo tray being hastily deposited onto the table. He hears the careless way the porcelain plate knocks against each other, hears the panicked shuffling of feet, and a soft cry of his name.</p><p>Then, a warm hand slips into his, and Luo Binghe is once again by his side.</p><p>“Shizun?” he calls, slightly alarmed.</p><p>Luo Binghe hovers worriedly above him by his bedside, his hand still gripping tightly onto Shen Qingqiu’s. Then, he lifts his other free hand, and gently presses the back of his fingers against the hollow curve of his flushed cheek.</p><p>“Shizun? Is everything alright? Are you feeling unwell?” He asks, lowering his voice into a soft whisper, hand still pressed against his cheek. “Should this disciple call for a physician?” </p><p>Binghe’s hand is comfortingly cool against his skin, and Shen Qingqiu immediately feels a sense of relief. His nausea settles somewhat from the soothing touch of Binghe’s gentle fingers, the unbearable heat diminishing by just the slightest bit.</p><p>He shakes his head lightly in reply, feeling his temple pulse even as he squeezes his eyes shut. But another wave of nausea rolls past him, and Shen Qingqiu lets another muffled groan slip past his lips.</p><p>It’s really only slightly worse compared to that previous time in the water prison, but he never had to muffle his groans or pretend like everything was fine since he’d mostly always been alone anyway— or at least until Gongyi Xiao had stumbled across him in a stroke of pure coincidence, but Shen Qingqiu had already long since puked his entire guts out by the time he came.</p><p>But this time, he wasn’t alone.</p><p>He hasn’t <em> been </em>alone, for quite a while now.</p><p>This time, Luo Binghe is <em> here, </em>right beside him, shooting him worried glances bordering the lines of panic.</p><p>And somehow… Shen Qingqiu didn’t really want Binghe to see him like this.</p><p>So, he purses his lips and swallows down his whimpers, and in his efforts to pretend, he can feel the cold sweat beading at his forehead, the small beads of perspiration forming on his back.</p><p>He feels them in the crook of his elbows, at the back of his neck, between his thighs and underneath his robes. His bangs stick uncomfortably to his forehead, damp with sweat, much like the robes on his skin.</p><p>His nerves feel like they’ve been lit aflame, the pain converging into a ball of sharp, biting agony pooling in his abdomen. </p><p>It’s hard to tell which feels worse; the nausea reigning in his chest, or the sickening cramp twisting in his belly. But Luo Binghe remains standing faithfully by his bedside throughout it all, with his fingers still brushing lightly against his cheek, cool against his burning skin, and the pain of it all fades, just a little.</p><p>Then, Luo Binghe starts to pull away from him all of a sudden, his fingers leaving his cheek as he turns towards the door. And Shen Qingqiu immediately feels a sense of loss wash over him; suddenly, he is all too aware of how Binghe’s grip on his hand slackens as he pulls away, of how his warmth slips through his fingers and out of his grasp, and it immediately fills him with an odd sense of unplaceable unease.</p><p>“This disciple will retrieve a physician—” Luo Binghe decides, biting at his lips. Undisguised concern bleeds into his tone as he speaks, even as he hurries to leave, “This disciple does not want to leave Shizun alone in such a state, but Shizun requires a physician— This disciple will be back as soon as possible—”</p><p>Luo Binghe does not get to finish his sentence.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu’s body reacts before his mind even does—</p><p>—Before Luo Binghe even manages to fully turn away, Shen Qingqiu has already reached out to grasp at the front lapels of his robes with a free hand, stopping him midway. “—Wait,” He gasps out, weakly supporting himself up on a trembling elbow— the one that’s still clutching onto Luo Binghe’s hand, refusing to let go. Then he falters almost immediately after, brows pulling up into a hesitant frown almost as if he’s not entirely sure of what he’d wanted to say. But Shen Qingqiu’s grip on his hand tightens almost imperceptibly, even as he struggles to speak.</p><p>Luo Binghe stills.</p><p>The front of his robes is most definitely wrinkled with creases forming all over it, with how Shen Qingqiu is fisting over it with frail fingers. </p><p>But he finds that he cannot possibly even begin to care as something as minor as that, because—</p><p>“—Stay,” Shen Qingqiu eventually manages with great difficulty, looking incredibly embarrassed by his admission that his cheeks colours a pretty pink, the flush spreading its way down to his neck and the tip of his ears. </p><p>—<em>Because Shizun is asking him to stay. </em></p><p>And for the first few seconds after that, Luo Binghe is left helplessly overwhelmed by the sheer intensity of the emotions that crashes through him. Like a scorching tide, it falls upon his heart and lights it ablaze; having lived his entire life only knowing rejection, it’s everything he’s dreamed of— everything he’s ever longed for. </p><p>It makes a lump swell in his throat, heavy and painful. But before he even manages to gather his thoughts enough to wring out a reply, he sees Shen Qingqiu’s eyes dim just a little, hears a tiny little hitch in his shizun’s breath—</p><p>And then all too suddenly, the next thing Luo Binghe knows, Shen Qingqiu— his <em> strong</em>, gentle and kind shizun— is suddenly hurling, all over the floor.</p><p>He watches in horrified silence, as the bile rips through his shizun’s throat viciously and spills onto the floor. The force of his shizun’s regurgitation is so harsh that Luo Binghe finds himself locked into place, frozen stiffly into a tense line of muted horror at how his shizun is falling apart before his very eyes.</p><p>He vomits all over the floor, his bile pooling and splattering even onto the sole of his boots. He would have been disgusted if it were anybody else but his shizun. But it <em> is </em>his Shizun.</p><p>It is his <em> Shizun. </em></p><p>So Luo Binghe immediately grabs the wooden bucket of water sitting by the side of the bed, literally flinging its contents out of the window. In a split second he’s back by his shizun’s side, unheeding of the pool of bile on the floor, and he places that wooden bucket directly below his shizun.</p><p>The entire scene burns itself into Luo Binghe’s mind—</p><p>—Every little detail, branded into his memories.</p><p>The small tremors of his shizun’s shoulders, the shimmering wetness at the corners of his eyes. The way he collapses into a kneel onto the floor, the acrid stench of bile filling his nose, the grotesqueness of it against the soft brown of the floor.</p><p>Luo Binghe’s heart lurches.</p><p>Immediately, he shifts himself closer to Shen Qingqiu, reaching an arm out to loop over his shoulders, steadying him and gently tucking him to lean against his side. Shizun’s body is entirely pliant as Luo Binghe maneuvers him around, his arms weakly trembling from the force of his regurgitation, his knees bruised red and swollen from the impact against the ground. </p><p>Luo Binghe bites at his lips, a trace of scarlet burning in his irises as he looks at Shen Qingqiu’s weakly trembling figure, his red-rimmed eyes, and the pile of his fluids mixing along with his tears. He has never seen his shizun reduced to this state before, so completely helpless and overcome with pain, that all of his barriers came crashing down all at once. </p><p>Once, when he’d still been a young, naive child, Luo Binghe had wished that he could see his shizun devoid of all the facades he put up; to see him for who he was, stripped free of the aloof regality and cold indifference he always donned over his kind, loving heart, instead of only catching glimpses of it whenever he fluttered his fan.</p><p>When he grew a little older, he’d wished that he could tear the nonchalant mask off his shizun’s face, grip him by his chin with the bloodied claws he’d used to crawl out of the abyss, force his shizun to <em> look </em>at him. He’d wanted to know of his shizun’s thoughts, to know of his heart— did he really despise Luo Binghe, for the thing that he’s become?</p><p>But <em> this </em>had never been the way Luo Binghe had imagined it to be.</p><p>He’d never wished for his shizun to be in so much pain, that all of his defenses were forcibly torn apart, that he could only kneel involuntarily in a helpless show of vulnerability. Shizun’s emotions flicker painfully clear across his face in a way Luo Binghe has never seen before; it is so starkly clear that he can trace each and every one of it and burn the image of it into his memories— but Luo Binghe had never wanted <em> this</em>.</p><p>Luo Binghe swallows. With quivering fingers, he carefully brushes back the loose locks of Shen Qingqiu’s hair behind his ears, gently combing his fingers against his scalp as he gathers his hair into a loose ponytail at his nape. Shizun’s hair is damp with sweat and remnants of bile, and his robes are stained a grotesque green, but Luo Binghe only presses himself in closer.</p><p>But what he didn’t expect is for his shizun to clumsily push him away, with a hand sticky with vomit and sweat, and then with a raspy voice that absolutely breaks Luo Binghe’s heart—</p><p>“Don’t—” Shen Qingqiu struggles in between breathless gasps, “—come too close. It’s dirty.”</p><p>Of all things to be concerned about, of course this was what his Shizun was worried about. It’s so very much like him, and almost infuriating in a way—Luo Binghe wished for <em> nothing </em> but his shizun to understand the lengths he’d go for him, how his heart is made entirely <em> for </em> him and filled with nothing but <em> him</em>. How could Luo Binghe even begin to care whether he’d get dirty or not, when all he cared about in this life of his, was his shizun?</p><p>But Luo Binghe knows— he is aware, and he can still remember the sheen of panic that had flitted past his shizun’s eyes. His shizun had flung his arm away right before he’d started puking for fear of dirtying him, even though he’d been clutching at it so tightly just moments earlier—</p><p>—His shizun still thinks of him, even when overcome with pain.</p><p>An inexplicable feeling blooms in his chest; to know that he still had a small, little place in his shizun’s heart, Luo Binghe should be wild with joy. He’s yearned for it; there could be nothing more than Luo Binghe would want! He should be elated, he should be happy! </p><p>Yet elation is far from the only thing he feels; in the bittersweetness of his love where his happiness is met with sorrow, Luo Binghe still feels like his heart is contorting his pain, like his world is crumbling apart.</p><p>“Shizun,” he can only whisper, a helpless man in the wake of his love.</p><p>And that… was the first time Luo Binghe catches his shizun falling apart.</p><hr/><p>The second and third time happens, all within the span of a day.</p><p>It is only by the fourth, just a little into the early afternoon the following day, that Luo Binghe finally manages to connect the dots in his head and confirm his growing suspicions rolling about at the back of his mind. But by this time, this situation had already gone on for two days too long, repeated itself four times too many in Luo Binghe’s book— by the time he’d properly figured it out, his shizun had already fallen apart <em> four entire times </em>before his very eyes.</p><p>The realisation only fully snaps in when Shizun ends up retching <em> again </em>into an old, wooden pail, one that Luo Binghe had brought in after the second time his shizun had regurgitated all over the floor. Shizun retches in a fashion similar to the first time Luo Binghe had witnessed him in the throes of his helplessness, with trembling limbs and tear-stained cheeks and dribble of spit and vomit spilling all over his chin.</p><p>It’s a harrowing image, one that sears like a burning brand into Luo Binghe’s mind.</p><p>In all of his shizun’s episodes, the viciousness of the bile tearing past his lips never once wanes. No matter how many times Luo Binghe sees it, he finds that he can never get used to the way his shizun looks as he regurgitates; like he’s in so much pain, that even just simply staying upright seems to wrangle his entire breath away from him.</p><p>And Luo Binghe feels like his heart is being gouged out, everytime he bears witness to this.</p><p>So of course, the guilt that tears through him is equally as immense and soul-crushing as all the other times he’d found out for himself exactly how much he’d hurt his shizun with his own bare hands, when he eventually manages to connect the dots, and finally, <em> finally understand</em>, that the cause of his shizun’s regurgitation, had <em> still </em>been him all along.</p><p>Luo Binghe stiffly clenches his fist by his side. </p><p>Shizun is still sitting wearily on the bed before him, wiping away the dribble of spit and bile from the corner of his mouth with a handkerchief that Luo Binghe had pressed to his lips just moments ago. He acts like nothing’s happened, like he’s completely fine— even after he’d spent a quarter of a shichen retching and struggling to breathe while choking on his vomit.</p><p>And Luo Binghe finds that he <em> cannot </em>understand.</p><p>Didn’t his shizun hate him?</p><p>Didn’t his shizun despise him?</p><p>Abhorred him and the blood crawling in his veins, detested him enough to have him bleed by his sword, loathed him enough to have pushed him to hell himself—?</p><p>Then how can his shizun act like this, sit so casually on the bed right before him like nothing was wrong—? How could he even begin to look up at Luo Binghe, shoot him a grateful look when he passes him a cup of lukewarm tea to rid his breath of the stench of bile, smile fondly at him when he helps him sit on the edge of the bed, when it was Luo Binghe himself who had caused all of his shizun’s pain? He’d made him eat when he couldn’t, forced him to suffer through all the episodes of his regurgitation— How could his shizun smile genially at him like this, and then act like it’s not his fault at all—?</p><p>Anguish curls darkly in the pits of his stomach, an icy chill that feels like the crackling of ice over his broken heart.</p><p>He can only stare helplessly at his shizun in silence, who has all but taken to sipping at his tea in the period of time Luo Binghe had been wallowing in his guilt.</p><p>‘Why…” Luo Binghe bites at his lip, the sharp ends of his nails drawing blood as he presses it into his palm. “Why isn’t Shizun saying anything?” He asks tremblingly. “...Why won’t Shizun <em> ever </em>say anything…?” He repeats, looking helplessly lost. Xin Mo bleeds and quivers at his hip, the dark tendrils of its dreadful chill sinking into his stomach and spreading icily to his limbs and the tip of his fingers. His voice comes out hoarse, like he’s the one who has had his entire stomach contents ripped out from his throat instead of his shizun, but Luo Binghe feels like his entire heart is flaying, and it shows in the slight quiver of his voice, in how he swallows thickly around his words.</p><p> </p><p align="center"><em> I don’t want to hurt you, I’ve never wanted to hurt you</em>— <em><br/>
</em><br/>
—<em>But Shizun, why is hurting you the only thing I ever seem to do...? </em></p><p> </p><p>Shizun blinks languidly, lips curved around the rim of a teacup as he processes his words. He has his back leaned against the wooden post of the bed while he gingerly clutches at the handkerchief with his other hand, with his legs and bare feet peeking out from the hem of his robes dangling off the edges of the bed. He’s still recovering from his earlier episode, looking frail and decrepit in no way his shizun should look like, and he blinks, curiously, at Luo Binghe’s words.</p><p>“What is Binghe speaking of?” Shizun tilts his head, and Luo Binghe sees a hint of the green ribbon that he’d tied his shizun’s hair with peeking out as his hair falls over his lithe shoulders. </p><p><em> ...That Shizun never speaks of himself, </em> Luo Binghe answers, his voice echoing in his own mind as he stares dazedly at his shizun, <em> and this disciple ends up hurting you without ever meaning to. </em></p><p><em> That Shizun never speaks of his pain, </em> his mind a blistering discord of anguish when his eyes lingers on the bruises littered across his shizun’s wrists, <em> and this disciple will never know if Shizun is ever truly alright. </em> His shizun looks up at him in confusion, completely unguarded and relaxed, unlike how he’d initially been in the water prison. <em> That Shizun never speaks of his mind, and even until now, this disciple still does not know of Shizun’s heart. </em></p><p>
<em> Shizun. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Shizun, Shizun. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Shizun, do you still hate me for what I’ve become…? </em>
</p><p>“What did Binghe wanted this master to say?” Shizun prompts patiently, lowering the tea in his hands. The way his shizun’s voice comes out hoarse like it’s been scrubbed raw— Luo Binghe feels a tight, painful squeeze in his heart.</p><p>“—Shizun,” Luo Binghe calls brokenly. He swallows down a lump in his throat, “Shizun, why do you never… If Shizun had just—” He tries, biting at his lip. </p><p>Then, he stops altogether, and looks tearily into Shen Qingqiu’s bewildered gaze. </p><p>Carved from ice and jade, his shizun still looks ethereally beautiful like this despite still being sick and looking decrepitly frail. When Luo Binghe looks at him, he sees the pale green of his ribbon tumbling like silk over the ends of his hair that reaches down to curl loosely at his hip, and the gossamer robes that he’d dressed his shizun in hanging slightly off his shoulders to reveal the delicate arch of his pale, slender neck. </p><p>Shizun is only a mere arm’s length away from him, and he looks so, so <em> real, </em>unlike all the figments of the blurry images that he sees occasionally whenever Xin Mo’s demonic lust seeps into the seemingly endless well of sadness that he’s tucked away at a little corner of his heart. Yet somehow, his shizun still feels so far out of Luo Binghe’s reach, and every bit as ephemeral and untouchable as Luo Binghe remembers his shizun in his memories to be.</p><p>Luo Binghe bites his lip. Anxiousness twists in his belly, makes him prisoner to the guilt reigning over his thoughts.</p><p>“This… This disciple only wishes that Shizun can get better,” he tries, hesitantly. “Shizun’s health is all this disciple wishes for, and this disciple strives to be there for Shizun in his time of need,” voice cracking, Luo Binghe wavers. “But how can this disciple even begin to do so, if this disciple has been the reason for Shizun’s suffering...?”</p><p>Shizun stares blankly at him, but Luo Binghe forges on, biting his lip. “This… This disciple is inadequate and stupid, and cannot begin to guess Shizun’s thoughts,” he says, eyes a glimmering red flickering with uncertainty. “But if Shizun never speaks of his thoughts, then how would this disciple even begin to guess…? If Shizun never tells this disciple of when his actions are hurting him, then how would this disciple ever know…? Then, this disciple would have hurt Shizun without even realising— and how can I ever live with that…?” He breathes.</p><p>Then, a brief flicker of understanding passes through Shen Qingqiu’s eyes when he finally understands what Luo Binghe had been referring to, and it feels like a punch to his gut. </p><p>It really was true.</p><p>“It’s not Binghe’s fault,” Shen Qingqiu explains, a complicated expression etched onto his face like he doesn’t know how to phrase his thoughts. Shizun looks like he doesn’t blame him in the slightest, but the guilt is overwhelming, and Luo Binghe knows that he is entirely at fault.</p><p>It really <em> is </em>true.</p><p>
<em> Shizun had known all along. </em>
</p><p>“How could it not be?” Luo Binghe refutes stubbornly, voice shaky. “This disciple’s cooking had been the entire reason Shizun had been throwing up constantly over the past few days. Shizun is ill, and naturally, Shizun’s stomach will be weak and unable to accept most food. For this disciple to have made such an oversight, how could it not be my fault?” </p><p>“Binghe made <em> congee</em>,” Shen Qingqiu argues, an eyebrow arched. “Binghe made no such oversights.”</p><p>“It was still too heavy for Shizun to eat,” Luo Binghe insists. “And knowing of his condition, Shizun had refused to eat, time and time again, even in the water prison. Yet this disciple still insisted.” Luo Binghe swallows down a lump in his throat. “This disciple… remembers feeding Shizun an entire serving of congee. Some heavily flavoured chicken. And some candies,” he recites, tongue numb. “Did Shizun… Had Shizun ended up... that time, as well…?” He trails off.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu winces, and nervously darts his eyes away, but that was enough an answer for Luo Binghe.</p><p>Guilt settles stiffly in every corner of his heart. </p><p>He can’t help but remember all the times he’d insisted for his shizun to eat his cooking, remember all the times he’d brought over heavily flavoured dishes to pair with the food that he’d so carefully prepared. </p><p>...His shizun had always looked so reluctant to eat, whenever he’d brought the food over. </p><p>But Shizun had still finished the entire meal anyway, ate it clean every single time, so much so that Luo Binghe is unable to recall even a single instance whereby his shizun hadn't finished his food. </p><p>Shizun had never left even a single grain of rice uneaten.</p><p><em> “Of course it tastes good,</em>” his shizun had told him with an incredulous huff, on that very first day he’d woken up and Luo Binghe had asked if his cooking was still to his shizun’s tastes. <em> “When has Binghe’s cooking ever not been to this master’s tastes?” </em>He’d teased, with a hint of a fond smile playing at his lips and his palms folded elegantly across his lap, as if he hadn't just eaten an entire meal that would have been the cause of his painful regurgitation later.</p><p>And then, while still in the midst of his thoughts, a realisation suddenly dawns upon him, fills him with rising horror, and Luo Binghe suddenly stills.</p><p>He remembers—</p><p>—The last time Shizun had refused to eat, Luo Binghe had tortured him with his blood parasites.</p><p>Luo Binghe immediately feels his blood run cold, the icy terror numbing his veins. Was that why his shizun agreed to eat? Because he <em> couldn’t </em>refuse?</p><p>Because he’d thought that Luo Binghe would <em> hurt </em>him if he did?</p><p>Suddenly, everything made sense. </p><p>It was only natural that his shizun hadn’t spoken about his pain, hadn’t mentioned anything about his illness or how he’s wholly unable to eat. </p><p>He <em> couldn't. </em></p><p>When hurting him is everything that Luo Binghe has done, how could Shizun ever confide in him? When his pleas and refusals are met with bristling anger and blood parasites gnawing at his veins, how could he even begin to tell him otherwise?</p><p>Just like how his shizun had never given him a choice but to live knowing of pain…</p><p>In the end, hadn’t Luo Binghe also done the same…?</p><p>“..nghe? Binghe<em>, listen</em>—<em>"</em></p><p>Then, long, slender fingers suddenly wrap around his wrist, a cool chill against his skin snapping him out of his thoughts. He takes a sharp intake of breath, feeling like he’s only just surfaced from drowning in a sea of his own guilt. And when he blinks and looks back up, he sees Shen Qingqiu tugging at his wrist, reaching out to him with a concerned frown etched on his face.</p><p>He lets himself be bodily dragged over to the bed where Shen Qingqiu was sitting, and obediently takes his seat when Shen Qingqiu coolly pats at the empty spot beside him. His heart still stirs with heavy remorse, even when it’s so blindingly obvious that his shizun has never once held anything against him.</p><p>“It’s really not Binghe’s fault,” Shen Qingqiu eventually speaks up, after a long moment of debating with himself in silence. Then, he sighs, resignation seeping into his tone. “This master… has never really been good with words. It has never…” he pauses, mulling over his words, “...come across this master’s mind, to even mention such… issues. But none of these has ever been Binghe’s fault, and that is not a lie.”</p><p>“Shizun has always been independent and capable,” Luo Binghe agrees sincerely. “Why would there even be a need to mention such things to others, when Shizun has always been fully capable of resolving all of them by himself?” He says, fully ignoring the fact that the present situation was evidence enough that Shen Qingqiu was, in fact, <em> not </em>capable of resolving all worldly issues.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu’s lip twitches slightly in amusement. “That wasn’t what I was referring to, Binghe,” he clarifies, and Luo Binghe frowns. “This… illness,” he explains hesitantly, “isn’t something new. It’s something this master has lived with… a very long time ago. It went away for a little while, and now it’s back. The constant regurgitation constitutes part of the illness.” He pauses, looking very much uncomfortable as he speaks, like he’s never had to do this before, like Luo Binghe is the <em> first</em>— the <em> only </em>person that his shizun is slowly stripping away all the layers of his distantly aloof and nonchalant facade for.</p><p>“Do you understand, Binghe?” Shen Qingqiu fixes an unsure stare at him. “No matter what Binghe prepares, the outcome will most likely still be the same, and this master’s body will still end up… reacting in the same way. Skipping meals or practising inedia aren’t viable options, so this master would have to eat anyway,” he admits, eyes flickering down to stare wryly at his fingers. “And that… is partly why it’d slipped my mind to tell Binghe of all these.”</p><p>Luo Binghe stares at him, mind fixating on a particular part of Shen Qingqiu’s admission. “Shizun… Shizun didn’t—” he fumbles, “It wasn’t because Shizun was afraid of me?”</p><p>Shen Qingqiu blinks, his eyes shooting back up to stare at Luo Binghe in confusion. </p><p>“That I’ve… hurt you,” Luo Binghe explains stiffly, looking close to tears. “With my blood parasites. This disciple… This disciple had forced Shizun to eat, even when Shizun hadn’t wanted to.” He bites at his lips, the tang of iron fresh on his tongue. “When Shizun ate, all those times— it wasn’t because Shizun was… afraid of me?”</p><p>Shen Qingqiu’s eyes flickers, a hint of a pained expression flitting past his face, before his eyes softens. A familiar, lean hand with slender fingers comes up to settle atop his head, and Luo Binghe feels his breath hitch. Shizun’s hand feels warm against his scalp even though Luo Binghe knows that the tips of his shizun’s fingers are flushed a pretty pink from cold, but it still feels exactly as warm as all the other headpats his shizun had given him in Luo Binghe’s memories, back when his shizun still hadn’t come to despise his demon blood running in his veins. </p><p>“This master ate out of necessity,” Shen Qingqiu reassures, patting him once on his head. “If anything, Binghe’s cooking has always been this master’s favourite. If I had to eat and suffer the consequences of it, then this master would rather choose to indulge in Binghe’s cooking, at the very least.” Then, almost as if he’d only just processed the words he’d spoken, Shen Qingqiu flushes and clears his throat in embarrassment, a light sheen of pink dusting across his cheeks.</p><p>Nevertheless, the corner of Luo Binghe’s eyes prickles.</p><p>His heart lifts a little. He wonders if he can believe this…? </p><p>“Shizun had said that it had never crossed your mind to speak of such things,” Luo Binghe starts again, softly, feeling a little more bold now that his questions weren’t met with derisive contempt or the quiet reticence that his shizun had displayed ever since he’d returned from the abyss. He flickers his eyes back up to stare into Shen Qingqiu, and with how close they are sitting next to each other on the bed, Luo Binghe can see himself reflected in the silverish grey hues of his shizun’s irises framed under a curtain of dark lashes, a pretty, clear thing. “Did Shizun think there wasn’t a point?”</p><p>Shen Qingqiu hums thoughtfully. “You could say that,” he admits. He stares blankly at nothing for a moment or two, mulling over how to phrase his words, but Luo Binghe continues listening earnestly. “Nothing would change even if I spoke of it,” he finishes simply.</p><p>“This disciple—” Luo Binghe falters. He wonders if he’s being too forthcoming; asking this from his shizun. He feels like a naive, young child all over again, still tripping and stumbling as he fumbles his way in all matters concerning his shizun, despite him having grown into his figure lacking neither power nor strength.</p><p> “—This disciple wishes...to know all of Shizun’s thoughts,” daringly, he hears his nervous desperation bleed through his voice. “Everything about Shizun, I want to know them all,” he fumbles, feeling the tide of his emotions, the weight of his guilt and the torrent of his love washing over his heart. “Even if— Even if Shizun thinks it’s useless, this disciple still wants to try preparing lighter meals for you. Even if it may not work, this disciple still wants to brew Shizun digestive teas, and be by your side whenever Shizun needs me to.”</p><p>“Binghe—” Shen Qingqiu starts, hesitantly.</p><p>“—<em>Shizun,” </em> Luo Binghe pleads. He’d do just about <em> anything </em>if it means that his shizun can understand the spot that he’d carved out for himself in Luo Binghe’s heart was the entire thing itself. </p><p>
<em> I’d do anything for you, if only you’d let me. </em>
</p><p>Shen Qingqiu falls into silence.</p><p>“Alright,” he acequises eventually, after a long, long while. “This master will try,” he promises.</p><p>And this...is a promise that Luo Binghe finds himself holding on to, even long after this incident has passed.</p><hr/><p>After that, the days pass in tandem with his life, that trickles away slowly like sand in an hourglass.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu spends his afternoons watching his time pass him by.</p><p>His life is not fully his, now that he’s once again ill; it parts belong to the hateful illness that resides in his body, carried over from his time as Shen Yuan, that steals his autonomy and his <em> everything </em>away from him.</p><p>But even then, he still feels like he’s slowly gaining back a modicum of control over his relationship with his disciple— of which he’s slowly scraping back the broken fragments of their bond that he’s so cruelly torn apart, painstakingly piecing them back together shard by shard, with every day that he spends bed-ridden with Luo Binghe by his side. </p><p>And somehow, his precious disciple is always <em> there</em>.</p><p>He’s there in the mornings when he wakes, when he flutters his eyes open to the warmth of the sunlight tracing across his cheeks. He’s there late into the night, when he stirs in his sleep and sees the silvery moonlight spill into the darkness of the room.</p><p>Once, he’d woken up in the middle of the night, to see Luo Binghe tucking him back under the covers of the quilt. He’d blearily opened his eyes, saw the flicker of a candlelight burning by his bedside, and the iridescent red of Luo Binghe’s eyes, looking softly down at him.</p><p>His heart had thumped in his chest with just the tiniest hitch of his breath. From where he lay underneath the covers of the quilt, he could see the fluttering press of Luo Binghe’s lashes against his cheek, dark midnight sweeping over a beautiful, molten red staring straight into his eyes. </p><p>Luo Binghe had somewhat smiled a little ruefully, his breath fanning warmly across Shen Qingqiu’s cheeks, before he’d smoothly straightened his back until he’s no longer leaning so closely over Shen Qingqiu. <em> “Pardon this disciple for waking Shizun up,” </em> He’d said apologetically, looking a little guilty for having interrupted his shizun’s sleep. <em> “Shizun has a tendency to kick off the sheets in his sleep, so this disciple was a little worried…” </em>He’d trailed off, and then Shen Qingqiu had actually felt a surge of embarrassed indignation flare hotly in him—</p><p>—This disciple of his!! Was he actually implying that Shen Qingqiu’s sleeping habits were atrocious enough that he would even kick off his sheets while he was asleep like some— some toddler?!</p><p>Not possible! </p><p>What an absurd line of thought—!</p><p>Shen Qingqiu was elegant and cool in <em> every </em>way, even while asleep! No buts!</p><p>So, he’d taken to glowering slightly at his blackened sheep of a disciple, feeling a little wronged by his accusations. But then Luo Binghe had only gazed back at him sincerely with wide, worried eyes, a look that Shen Qingqiu finds he’s slowly becoming more accustomed to, with every day that passes.</p><p>And when Luo Binghe looks at him like that, Shen Qingqiu… Shen Qingqiu couldn’t help but immediately cave. After all, he has always been a weak-willed thing, soft like tofu on the inside despite looking untouchable and aloof, and he's always had a soft spot for this sticky disciple of his. So, feeling his heart twisting weirdly, Shen Qingqiu had only let out a sigh, and reached out to pat him on his head. When faced with the stallion protagonist’s pleading face, it was almost impossible to stay indignant. Shen Qingqiu folded like wet paper.</p><p>So he’d relented and allowed Luo Binghe to accompany him through the night after being met head-on with the full force of his teary gaze. He’d pulled him down by his hand, tugging sharply on his wrist until Luo Binghe was seated comfortably beside him on the edge of the bed. His sticky little disciple had blushed like a maiden, even squirmed a little while sitting on the bed, and had only settled down after Shen Qingqiu shot him an annoyed stare. But the night still passed with a soothing lull with Luo Binghe by his side, and Shen Qingqiu had eventually nodded off leaning against the headrest of the bed. </p><p>And the next time Shen Qingqiu woke, he found himself once again tucked into bed, with the quilts pulled comfortably up to his chin.</p><p>On some other occasions, he’d flitted out of his dreams in the middle of the night, to see his precious disciple kneeling by his bedside wiping away his fever sweat with a damp, silk cloth. Luo Binghe doesn’t always notice when Shen Qingqiu comes into consciousness, but his precious disciple always wears his heart on his sleeves whenever he thinks that his shizun is still asleep. Shen Qingqiu had seen the rawness of his emotions; felt the way Binghe had softly pressed the cloth against his skin, the way Binghe had tenderly gripped at his wrist.</p><p>He had pressed two fingers above it, and every night, Shen Qingqiu had felt a steady stream of warm, soothing qi filling him carefully, lovingly. And then he’d felt it all disperse and fade away into a barely noticeable thrumm underneath his skin.</p><p>And then he’d felt this repeat over and over again while he’d pretended to be asleep. Throughout it all, Luo Binghe will kneel by his bedside clutching at him, trying over and over and <em> over again </em> as his tears drop wetly onto Shen Qingqiu’s wrist. </p><p>How could mere tears feel so scalding against his skin—? Shen Qingqiu didn’t really understand the way he had felt, but his heart had ached fiercely with every flutter of qi Luo Binghe pushed into his veins.</p><p>...And in all of those instances, Shen Qingqiu’s not always entirely sure how long Luo Binghe has been there for, or how late into the night it is. But the moon is always brightly lit and shimmering with a soft silver by the time he wakes and sees Luo Binghe tending to him by his bedside.</p><p>Of course, Luo Binghe isn’t <em> always </em>there; in those rare, little moments he wakes up alone, Shen Qinqiu is always wondering where his sticky disciple has gone off to. But in every other moment, Shen Qingqiu is always wishing that he could accompany Binghe for just a little while longer— whether it is during the night or in life itself, so that Binghe wouldn’t have to look so alone whenever he stands shrouded in gloomy darkness.</p><p>But Shen Qingqiu’s consciousness slips away from him just like his life, and he always ends up falling asleep, even with Luo Binghe by his side. And then Binghe will be all alone again, for the remainder of the night— for the remainder of his life, when Shen Qingqiu eventually dies and revives, only to have to leave him behind—</p><p>—and then he will suddenly wake up to that same wretched nausea reigning in his chest.</p><p>He will end up puking all over again, despite Luo Binghe’s painstaking efforts in changing up his meals. And then once it’s all over, he will look up, only to realise that his precious, <em> precious </em>disciple, who kneels right next to him with his knees pressed closely against his own, has never once left his side.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu feels his heart twist—</p><p>When stripped of his anger, Shen Qingqiu can see Luo Binghe just the slightest bit clearer. </p><p>In the place of his anger, he can see the deep-seated desperation in the furrow of his brows, the heartbreak embedded into his eyes. It always shines teary and wet when he looks at him, glimmers in a way that leaves Shen Qingqiu curling his fingers into his palms.</p><p>It makes him want to reach out and hold him by his hand, to tangle his fingers and bury them in the locks of his hair. It fills him with <em> want</em>, a molten desire burning at him from within, to hold Binghe close and tell him of all the things he’s buried deep in his heart.</p><p>But Shen Qingqiu has always been bad with words. He’s always not sure of what to say, of what he <em> should </em> say. He thinks that maybe he should try a little harder, especially when it comes to this precious little disciple of his, who hangs onto his every word like a starving child begging for love— especially when it is <em> Luo Binghe </em>himself, who had asked this of him, with a trembling voice and a desperate gaze after he’d puked for the fourth time all over him.</p><p>So, now, he’s sitting quietly in silence again, mulling over his words as Mu Qingfang presses two fingers to his wrist. Having already lived through this once, he’s already fully aware of what Mu Qingfang’s diagnosis of his health will be.</p><p>But how was he supposed to break this to this precious disciple of his, whose gaze falls on him like he’s looking upon a star in the sky, that he was running out of time…? </p><p>In his silence, Shen Qingqiu flutters his fan uneasily over his face, one that Luo Binghe had thoughtfully given him just days prior. It fits impeccably well in his hands, the smooth wooden guard of the fan slotting perfectly between the ridge of his fingers. Decorated familiarly with the silhouette of stalks of bamboo leaves, the fan very much reminds him of one of his favourites that he’d used back in the past, when Luo Binghe had still been a naive, adorable sheep—</p><p>—He can’t help but wonder if it was intentional, if Luo Binghe had remembered.</p><p>Mu Qingfang sits tensely on the sandalwood stool right next to his bed, entirely silent as he checks over his meridians and prods at his qi with his own. Somehow, it’s all very soothing; Mu Qingfang’s presence and the careful way his spiritual energy nudges around in his veins— the familiarity of it makes him feel like he’s slightly closer to home again.</p><p>Luo Binghe is standing slightly further back, with his arms folded across his chest and Xin Mo slung casually over his hip. He has his eyes trained on the Qian Cao Peak Lord, watching over them carefully with a frown pulling at his brows.</p><p>“How is he?” He hears Luo Binghe ask, tense wariness seeping into his tone.</p><p>Mu Qingfang remains silent, his lips pursing tightly together almost as if displeased, in a way Shen Qingqiu rarely ever sees on his fellow peak lord known for his genial temperament and serene smiles. Despite this, he settles his wrist back down on the sheets with the same gentleness that Shen Qingqiu has known all his life since the very first day he’d transmigrated.</p><p>Then, he turns towards Luo Binghe, and fixes a contemplative stare onto him. </p><p>“...Shen-shixiong was fine when he left the peak for Jin Lan City,” he begins, after a moment of silence, uncaring of Luo Binghe’s initial question. “He was fine back then even after coming down with Without-A-Cure” —<em>all for you</em>— “and was fine even back then when we last saw him at Jin Lan City,” He continues, rather flatly, and Shen Qingqiu is almost stunned to see the rare display of displeasure on his fellow peak lord. “Tell me why, then, has his health deteriorated to this state once we left him in your care? I clearly remember Huan Hua agreeing to keep him in <em>perfect </em>health until his trial commences.” </p><p>At his words, Luo Binghe’s eyes flash dangerously, and his lips twists into a scowl— an expression befitting of the blackened stallion protagonist that Shen Qingqiu hasn’t actually seen for quite a while now, ever since he’d collapsed back at the water prison and Luo Binghe had turned into something like a something like a cross-breed between a worried mother-hen and a sticky little sheep.</p><p>“Peak Lord Mu should take care not to overstep his boundaries,” Luo Binghe replies darkly, fingers curling threateningly around Xin Mo’s hilt. “Don’t be mistaken as to think that I care about your Cang Qiong Sect, when I will only ever answer to a single person. I <em> only </em> care about Shizun, and I <em> only </em>brought you here to see to Shizun’s health,” he sneers, and Shen Qingqiu almost feels mortified by his words. </p><p>Mu Qingfang blinks, looking slightly taken aback at the sheer animosity dripping from Luo Binghe, and Shen Qingqiu silently lit a candle in his heart for his fellow peak lord.</p><p>Of course anybody would be stunned by the blackened Luo Binghe!! He had been such a cute little puppy back then, always following his shizun around while wagging his tail— now that he’d been substantially scarred by Shen Qingqiu’s heartless actions, his thinly-veiled threats and bitter hostility would have anyone doing a double-take!! The difference between his cute little puppy and this blackened lotus standing before them was really just too much!!</p><p>Nevertheless, Mu Qingfang visibly recollects himself, and tries his best to settle his expression into one of moderate affability. Despite this, he doesn’t relent in the slightest; Shen Qingqiu almost felt like he was watching a rather intense soap opera.</p><p>“With Shen-Shixiong’s health as it is, pardon me if I am unable to fully believe your words. Who are you to stop Cang Qiong Mountain Sect from storming Huan Hua Palace and retrieving Shen-Shixiong, when it was Huan Hua Sect who had broken the pact in the first place?” He says calmly, and at this point Shen Qingqiu is almost gaping at Mu Qingfang’s bold display of assertiveness—</p><p>—Mu-shidi?!?! Surely you can’t just suddenly decide that all on your own??? What happened to having Peak Lord Meetings, were they all just for show????</p><p>“Shizun is going <em> nowhere </em>!” Luo Binghe hisses back immediately, Xin Mo starting to vibrate in its sheath. And then Shen Qingqiu immediately feels his hackles rise, Mu Qingfang’s melodramatic declaration shoved to the back of his mind— if Luo Binghe’s demonic heritage were to be revealed now, then wouldn’t everything be an even greater mess than it already was…?</p><p>“—Mu-shidi,” Shen Qingqiu promptly interrupts, breaking out in cold sweat at the literal wildfire about to unfold right before his eyes. “It’s fine.” And when Mu Qingfang shoots him a disbelieving look, he clears his throat, and adds, “Binghe has actually been very diligent when it comes to this shixiong’s health. This shixiong doesn’t mind staying under Binghe’s care.”</p><p>And just like that, for some reason, Luo Binghe’s anger immediately vanishes like wisps of smoke, and he whips his head around to stare at him with partly widened eyes. “Shizun,” he breathes, stunned. The way Luo Binghe looks at him makes his blood flush hotly with embarrassment under his skin.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu single-mindedly tries his best to avoid his gaze.</p><p>Mu Qingfang purses his lips, looking a little strained. “Shen-shixiong would do well to rest in Qing Jing Peak. This shidi can better provide you with assistance, that way. Does shixiong not wish to return?”</p><p>...Must you phrase it that way, Mu-shidi???!?! Why did it sound like he was a patient suffering from stockholm syndrome wishing to stay as a captive prisoner????</p><p>Feeling slightly wronged, Shen Qingqiu steadfastly chooses not to deign himself to reply. Instead, he flutters his fan again before his face, and changes the topic. “Tell me, exactly how bad is my health, Mu-shidi?”</p><p>Mu Qingfang only continues staring at him perplexingly for a moment longer. Then, seeing Shen Qingqiu’s wordless stubbornness, he visibly deflates with a sigh, before reluctantly settling himself back into his seat. After a split second of silence, he parts his lips to speak. “For starters, Shen-shixiong is… rather ill,” he begins hesitantly.</p><p>Luo Binghe scowls again, unamused. “Why else would you be here?” He interrupts impatiently with a glower, in a rhetorical manner that if the topic hadn’t been such a sombre one, Shen Qingqiu would actually have found it funny. “Tell me <em> why </em>Shizun is not recovering!” </p><p> “Binghe,” Shen Qingqiu chides instinctively, out of sheer habit from having done this countless times before back when Binghe had still been a white lotus under his care. But by the time Shen Qingqiu realised this, Binghe had already reluctantly settled back down like it was only natural for him to listen to his shizun’s instructions, and Shen Qingqiu could only silently let Mu Qingfang reach for his wrist to probe at his meridians again. </p><p>“Shen-shixiong’s meridians are weak,” Mu Qingfang explains, a small frown marring his brows. Then, he pauses, choosing his words carefully, “It seems like the compounded effects of Without-A-Cure and Shen-shixiong’s illness has left... quite a significant impact on his core and his meridians. It… might even have been exacerbated by the immortal binding cables, depending.”</p><p>Shen Qingqiu shifts slightly on the bed, feeling an unsettling unease creep up on him once he’s heard Mu Qingfang’s hesitant, sympathetic tone.</p><p>Okay, maybe this wasn’t really a good change in topic. This entire conversation was only one diagnosis away from turning into a full-blown emotional avalanche— and Shen Qingqiu had originally wanted to break the news gently to Luo Binghe. But Binghe had stubbornly refused to budge an inch when Shen Qingqiu had requested him to fetch some tea earlier, so now Luo Binghe was stuck with hearing the news directly, and perhaps even bluntly, from Mu Qingfang himself.</p><p>“...And the cure?” Luo Binghe eventually asks. He stands stiffly behind them, eyes boring holes into the back of Mu Qingfang’s head.</p><p>A long while passes, and Mu Qingfang does not speak. He fixes his gaze onto the floor, and purses his lips.</p><p>Somehow, that silence is all the answer they need.</p><p>Luo Binghe stares, and stares and stares.</p><p>And he stares, until Mu Qingfang’s silence drags on for too long that the harrowing truth of the transience of his life is dragged out to light, with a striking clarity that could not possibly have been clearer even if it were put to words—</p><p>—Luo Binghe’s expression twists, and his face contorts into a broken-hearted disbelief.</p><p>"—<em>Shizun</em>," he eventually whispers brokenly, a shaky breath under the clutches of grief.</p><p>And Shen Qingqiu felt his heart crumbling all over again.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em> Don’t you know, Luo Binghe? </em>
</p><p>
<em> The person who wishes for your happiness is also the person who has hurt you the most. </em>
</p><p>
<em> For not being able to give you the happiness you deserve, Shizun... </em>
</p><p>
<em> ...Shizun is so, so sorry. </em>
</p><hr/><p>It's a slow, chillingly subtle thing, but after Mu Qingfang’s visit, Shen Qingqiu’s life continues to steadily slip away without his notice, like clouds drifting deceivingly slow in the skies. Many times now he’s glanced back out of the windows, only to find that the clouds that he’d been gazing upon mere moments earlier have completely passed him by.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu finds that it’s very much like his life, and whatever that’s left of his time.</p><p>It’s all within his expectations, the way his health steadily declines; Shen Qingqiu has long since accepted that this is how things would come to be. He sleeps longer now, and wears out faster while he’s awake. Sometimes, he even ends up falling asleep in the middle of the day, only to wake up many hours later to see the sun just barely peeking over the horizon, blanketing the skies in streaks of incandescent orange, softly glowing over the figure of his precious disciple asleep and kneeling by his bedside. </p><p>And when he finally comes to, suddenly, an entire day would have passed— another day of his life he’s lost to this wretched illness of his, another day less that he’s able to spend by Luo Binghe’s side.</p><p>Ever the sticky little thing, the occasions where Shen Qingqiu wakes up alone are few and far between; Luo Binghe clings to him and sticks by his bedside in a fashion similar to what Shen Qingqiu still fondly remembers of his disciple back in his early days, even more so now that Binghe has heard Mu Qingfang’s diagnosis for himself.</p><p>Like sticky malt candy, Shen Qingqiu finds that he often has to pry that dear blackened sheep of his off his back; many times now when he’d still been feeling a little more energetic, he’d taken to stretching and walking around the room to work out the stiffness in his muscles. But Luo Binghe had all but trailed silently after his footsteps, shooting him aggrieved, worried glances while looking like he’s only seconds away from literally scooping him up and carrying him around in his arms, and then they will spend a good fifteen minutes circling around the room looking quite literally like a mother duck Shen Qingqiu with an overgrown duckling Luo Binghe waddling closely behind— give your Shizun a little breathing space, would you?! Shizun already has difficulty breathing with his illness as it is!</p><p>Nevertheless, it was kind of cute, in a way. It reminded him of sweeter days of a bygone past, of what they used to be.</p><p>But it also brought a fresh wave of heartache every single time Shen Qingqiu sees Luo Binghe’s dedication for himself— see his desperation and guilt threaded and interwoven into his love and care. </p><p>It would have been impossible for him not to notice it, for Shen Qingqiu has always been paying attention to that sweet young child he’d raised under his care— for he’s always had a special place in his heart for the stallion protagonist of the novel he’d spent the final months of his previous life reading, for that blackened sheep of a disciple he’s hurt beyond compare and yet still held his shizun so dearly in his heart.</p><p>And now, he can’t help but notice that Luo Binghe is always looking upon him with disbelief and an astonished wonder, as if he’s <em> afraid </em>to let himself believe that he could have all of this again. </p><p>The saddest part was that it would all make sense, if that were to be the case. After all, Luo Binghe had looked at him with a similar expression of disbelief back then as well, at the opening of the abyss. He’d stubbornly clung onto his last shreds of hope and refused to believe that his shizun, who had been so indulgently kind and soft with him in all the ways he’d never experienced for himself before— in all the ways the world has never deemed him as <em> worthy </em>of having before— would so cruelly denounce his demon blood and actually condemn him into a place worse than hell.</p><p>But Shen Qingqiu did, and he had even pierced his chest with his sword and his own two hands— how could Luo Binghe even <em> bring </em>himself to believe, after all of that…? </p><p>“..zun…?”</p><p>Distantly hearing a voice call out to him, Shen Qingqiu blinks, and the world flits back into view.</p><p>“—Shizun?” Luo Binghe’s voice calls again gently from behind, his breath tickling his ear.</p><p>Slightly startled, Shen Qingqiu turns his gaze slightly to the sight of his beloved disciple peering down at him with a worried frown from behind the sandalwood chair. The empty dishes that he’d just eaten are still sitting on the table before him— Luo Binghe had meticulously prepared a light nourishing soup, with the vegetables stewed and simmered to glistening perfection in the clear, rich amber of the broth— and in a very Luo Binghe-esque fashion, it had still been as fragrant and flavourful as Shen Qingqiu remembers all of his dishes to be. </p><p>It really shouldn’t have been possible, especially since Luo Binghe had avoided the use of any heavy spices or seasonings in consideration of his shizun’s pathetically delicate constitution and pitifully weak stomach. But Shen Qingqiu hadn’t been surprised in the slightest; this was a feat that’s accomplishable <em> only </em>by the flawless stallion protagonist himself— perfect in every way!</p><p>Nevertheless, despite all of Luo Binghe’s efforts, Shen Qingqiu has still been throwing up every single day. Of course, with the way Luo Binghe is preparing his meals, Shen Qingqiu no longer feels like he’s being stabbed by a million knives or hurling his entire guts out in all of his episodes, but he never truly <em> stops </em>regurgitating as a result of him eating.</p><p>And every single time, he has to watch for himself the way Luo Binghe’s expression twists painfully into one of guilt. Shen Qingqiu hates it— how Luo Binghe’s face crumbles, how his beloved disciple tries so, <em>so </em>hard in changing up his meals and tweaking different parts of his recipes only to have it all come to naught— <em>hates </em>the way Luo Binghe has to watch him hurl his food back out and watch him grasp desperately at the wooden tiles of the floor as he suffocates and chokes on the filth of his own making. </p><p>“...Binghe,” Shen Qingqiu eventually acknowledges, throat bobbing slightly. It’s a little painful to speak— perhaps it was his fever acting up again? “This master was just lost in his own thoughts, Binghe has no need to worry.”</p><p>Luo Binghe continues looking at him with concern glimmering in his eyes, leaning over from behind the sandalwood chair. “If Shizun says so,” he hesitantly agrees, his eyes trailing over Shen Qingqiu’s complexion. Then, easing his shoulders slightly, Luo Binghe lets a small smile graze past his face. “Shizun must be thinking really hard, then, to be lost in his thoughts for so long.”</p><p>“...” Shen Qingqiu says, feeling a little aggrieved.</p><p>...Was it just his imagination or was his Binghe a little more snarky now after coming out of the abyss…? What kind of character development was this supposed to be— had his sunny, meek little sheep who blushed at even the slightest pat on his head really turned into this?! Shen Qingqiu wanted a refund!!</p><p>Nevertheless, despite all his indignation that showed clearly on his face, Luo Binghe continues plastering himself to Shen Qingqiu, pressing himself in so closely that Shen Qingqiu can feel the warmth of his body seeping into his skin through the layers of his robes and the light brushes of his fingers trailing across his neck. </p><p>It's distracting enough that Shen Qingqiu ends up subconsciously fixating on it— on how close Luo Binghe's face is to his when he leans over his shoulders like this, on the intimacy of their actions and the fondness of his gaze when he's looking at him with that deep burning red of his eyes.</p><p>“...If you understand, then stop sticking so closely to this master,” Shen Qingqiu chides, feeling heat slowly creep up his neck. It blends in with his fever heat, makes it just a little harder to breathe. Shen Qingqiu stifles a cough. “This master isn’t going to faint, Binghe can stand a little further back.”</p><p>Then, Luo Binghe exhales an amused huff, a light, airy thing. Shen Qingqiu blinks again, momentarily riveted by the clarity of his fondness shining in his voice.</p><p>“How else will this disciple tend to Shizun’s hair, if this disciple is to stand any further back?” He asks, lips curving up slightly with mirth. Nevertheless, he straightens himself upright so that his face is no longer mere centimeters away from Shen Qingqiu’s cheek, and then reaches out to gently tuck a flyaway strand of hair behind his ear for emphasis.</p><p>The warmth from Luo Binghe’s fingers makes the tip of his ears burn red. Flustered, Shen Qingqiu snaps his gaze back to stare resolutely at the table before him instead of the protagonist, before hastily reaching out to take a sip of his medicated tea.</p><p>...Sure, he’d agreed to what he now dubbed as “Luo Binghe’s Free Premium Head Massage session for VIP-customer<strike> (s) </strike> Only”, of which VIP-customers was actually really only just him, and it had turned into something of a regular affair, but… Has his disciple always been this cheeky??? Where was his adorable blackened little sheep who clutched onto his hand and looked upon him with teary eyes like a distraught maiden while he lay incapacitated on the bed??</p><p>“Fine. Do as you will,” he relents, his ears still burning. Dear protagonist, please keep your sense of decorum... Being sticky as an adorable young child is fine and all, but now that you’ve grown, shouldn’t you at least be a little more aware of personal space???</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, Luo Binghe smiles fondly at the sight that his shizun paints, elegantly sipping at his tea while pretending to be as unshaken as ever. Despite the tentative familiarity they’ve awkwardly eased themselves into over the past week or so— one that Luo Binghe had thought he’d lost forever— his heart still clenches a little painfully even when his heart is filled with so much <em> warmth. </em> No matter what he does, or how desperately <em> hard </em>he tries, Shizun still looks ivory pale and all too thin from the illness stealing him away; his life going by like transient bubbles drifting off into the skies to a place Luo Binghe is unable to follow. </p><p>When he looks at him, beneath the sallow hue of his skin, Luo Binghe can see the faint traces of his veins mapping across the inside of his thin, delicate wrists, see the bony edges of his fingers and the jut of his shizun’s wrists. Shizun’s sleeves fall to his elbows as he sips embarrassedly at his tea, revealing slender, lithe arms that tremble weakly as he holds his cup to his lips.</p><p>Somehow, his shizun still remains so easily flustered even after having ruthlessly kicked him down into the abyss, and Luo Binghe relishes in each and every pinkish flush that he manages to bring out from underneath his shizun’s skin, especially when he’s pale and sickly like this. It makes him look like he was no longer out of Luo Binghe’s reach, when he’s filled a little more with life, with his blood flushing down his neck and suffusing across his cheeks like this.</p><p>“Then, Shizun will have to pardon this disciple for his boldness,” Luo Binghe says while still looking unrepentantly indulgent. He reaches out to gently tug on the ends of the pale green ribbon, the very same one that Shen Qingqiu had taken to wearing after Luo Binghe had given it to him, and watches as Shen Qingqiu’s hair tumbles down across his shoulders. Then, lathering some oil onto his hands from a tiny vial, Luo Binghe carefully gathers Shen Qingqiu’s hair into his hands, his calloused fingers lightly brushing across his nape and sending shivers down Shen Qingqiu’s spine.</p><p>Then, Luo Binghe starts to gently work the oil into the tips of his hair, slipping his fingers and tangling them into the loose locks of his hair, before slowly and soothingly working his way up to his scalp. Luo Binghe’s fingers, slender and firm, fit perfectly against the curve of his nape, pressing into the spot right behind his ears. It’s all so soothing— the comforting warmth of his fingers against his scalp and the way he can feel his disciple dragging his fingers rhythmically through the length of his hair— Shen Qingqiu can feel the throbbing in his temples dissipating, feel himself relaxing just the slightest bit more as Luo Binghe tenderly works the oil into his hair.</p><p>Luo Binghe’s touches are insistently gentle and careful; he tangles his fingers into his hair and presses his palm against his scalp in an almost reverent manner, before slowly running his fingers through and letting his hair fall and scatter across his back like silk cascading over his shoulders. The pads of his thumbs skims lightly against the shell of his ear whenever he combs the silky strands of his hair back and anoints it with oil, and Shen Qingqiu can feel the thrums of pleasure coursing through his veins every single time Binghe deliberately scrapes his nails lightly against his scalp, running it down soothingly to his nape.</p><p>And although it does take him quite a while, Shen Qingqiu eventually allows himself to slowly relax into Luo Binghe’s soothing touches and indulgent care, his affection boundless and brimming with every stroke of his fingers against his scalp that threads gently through his hair.</p><p>And Shen Qingqiu falls asleep in the haze of his fever just like that, dreaming of a forever in the transience of his now.</p><hr/><p>A few more days pass, and when it’s clear that Shen Qingqiu’s condition is in no way improving even with Mu Qingfang’s prescribed medications, Luo Binghe starts disappearing for hours at a time. He leaves in the middle of the night once Shen Qingqiu has fallen asleep in search for miraculous cures and mysterious artifacts— any that held even just the slightest chance of restoring Shen Qingqiu’s health— and comes back late into the day when the sun’s harsher edge has mellowed down into warm rings of amber lights, looking worn and ragged with helplessness carved into the lines of his shoulders and the iridescent red of his eyes.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu is always waiting, leaning idly against the headrest of his bed by the time he comes back. Sitting comfortably draped under the covers of the quilts, he holds a book in his hands, one that Binghe had thoughtfully given him days prior to pass the time while he’s not there to accompany him, with his fan lying by his bedside, which he occasionally picks up to fiddle with and run his fingers across the carvings on the wooden guard. </p><p>And he waits.</p><p>He waits, and reads a sentence or two which his mind barely registers, and waits again, until he hears the click of the door opening and familiar footsteps shuffling into the room. </p><p>A familiar silhouette, a familiar greeting, and a familiar “<em>Shizun”. </em></p><p><em> ...</em>To Shen Qingqiu, the sight of Binghe returning, unexpectedly always settles his heart. He wonders if his disciple’s stickiness was rubbing off him, as well? But when he thought about it and mulled over it, repeatedly flicking his fan open and restlessly snapping it shut while he sat all alone on his bed during the times Luo Binghe was not around, it all made sense. After all, he’s spent so much more time with Luo Binghe by his side in the recent few days, it was only natural that Shen Qingqiu would grow accustomed to his presence, and even find himself missing him from time to time.</p><p>So, to suddenly be left all alone after weeks of being tightly and persistently clung onto— of course Shen Qingqiu would be disconcerted!</p><p>Sure, he had complained about Binghe’s stickiness, but those were just him griping at best; as Shen Qingqiu of the Xiu Ya sword, he still had an image to maintain and a reputation to keep. To be so bold as to blatantly tell Binghe that he’d rather he stay and keep him company— wouldn’t that just make him sound like he was some pathetically lonely old man…?</p><p>Shen Qingqiu’s paper-thin face wouldn’t allow for him to speak of such embarrassing words!</p><p>—So, he doesn’t.</p><p>But what he <em> does, </em>instead, is to help Luo Binghe brush his hair, after he returns. It always takes him a considerable amount of effort especially considering his weak noodle arms, but it’s something he’d always done for his white-lotus Binghe whenever he had been feeling down, or just drained in general. His Binghe had always tried to hide it, as he does even now, but this is something Shen Qingqiu wishes he can still continue doing for that lovable disciple of his, until the day he dies and has to leave his life as Shen Qingqiu behind.</p><p>But more than that—</p><p>—It’s something Shen Qingqiu wishes his Binghe will still continue to have, even after he dies and revives, and every single day after that. By then, Shen Qingqiu would no longer be able to do all these small little things for his precious disciple, but he still hopes that there will always be someone by Luo Binghe’s side; to brush his hair when he’s exhausted and feeling down, to pat him on his head whenever he looks at them with that wide, adoring eyes that he subconsciously makes even after he’s blackened— that that precious, lovable child will never have to bear and carry the weight of his sadness all alone.</p><p>And it is with that thought woven into his heart that Shen Qingqiu will fall asleep, cradling his hopes for his disciple’s future deep within his chest. Then, Luo Binghe will leave again in the middle of the night, with Shen Qingqiu waking up to a burning fever the very next day, while he grasps at the sheets of the bed instead of a warm, calloused hand that takes hold of his own as he sleeps.</p><p>Yet, despite Luo Binghe’s regular departures, Shen Qingqiu is never left <em> completely </em> alone; the blackened protagonist leaves Gongyi Xiao to tend to him in his place while he’s gone— to which Shen Qingqiu still feels a little miffed by, especially because Gongyi Xiao diligently reports <em> ten </em>minutes early for his ‘duty’.</p><p>...Even if he’s ill, Shen Qingqiu is still very much a peak lord, alright? Why were they treating him as if he needed a babysitter 24/7???</p><p>Nevertheless, Gongyi Xiao’s presence still made liaising with Airplane-bro a lot more convenient, so Shen Qingqiu had very grudgingly accepted Gongyi Xiao’s mother-henning. And even though Gongyi Xiao would never be as adept in taking care of a sick patient in all the way his Binghe was, Shen Qingqiu knew furtively that it couldn’t be helped— to compare a cannon fodder to Luo Binghe himself was just be unfair, wouldn’t it? Binghe was the stallion protagonist, after all!</p><p>But even though he’s been technically left under Gongyi Xiao’s care, all of Shen Qingqiu’s meals and medications are still carefully prepared by Luo Binghe himself. From the flavours to the plating of the dishes to the careful selection of the spices and ingredients, Shen Qingqiu knows for himself very well that all of those dishes, are still Luo Binghe’s personal handiwork, prepared desperately and fervently in hopes that his shizun might feel better and stay by his side for just the slightest bit longer. </p><p>Yet, even then, Shen Qingqiu still feels like every mouthful of the congee that he swallows sits a little heavier in his stomach, every spoonful of soup that he drinks tastes just a little bit blander, whenever he eats and Luo Binghe isn’t by his side. </p><p>He tries his hardest not to dwell upon it, but sometimes, during the days when he wakes up to his fever flaring away viciously in his body, or on the days he wakes up so exhausted with a bone-deep weariness and his muscles burning so painfully that he’s barely able to lift himself off the bed, he can’t help but take notice of the fact that the time he’s able to spend with Luo Binghe by his side is only steadily dwindling, with every passing day.</p><p>It’s even worse now, especially since he spends half of it asleep and the other half in a feverish state that only seems to burn away more of him as time passes. And his precious, beloved disciple always returns to him looking increasingly exhausted and desperate that Shen Qingqiu can only allow his precious disciple to silently hold onto his hand as he kneels by his bedside until he eventually calms down enough for Shen Qingqiu to brush his hair— and in all of those instances, Shen Qingqiu can see the weariness clinging onto his bones, and the quiet sadness that envelops him like a heavy cloak whenever he returns to his side and see his shizun in a frailer state than before.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu can’t help but worry about his disciple, when he’s pushing himself tirelessly like this. Maybe the next time Binghe returns, Shen Qingqiu will order him to go to bed and have a proper day of rest, instead of plastering himself to his side like Shen Qingqiu was his own personal teddy bear. If it was an order from his shizun, then Binghe wouldn’t refuse, right???</p><p>In the midst of his thoughts, he’s momentarily distracted by the door of his room opening, only to reveal a sunny youth entering from the doorway. His vision swirls when he turns to look, and for a split second, he’d almost half expected a familiar figure dressed in the bleeding colours of black and red to enter the doorway.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu blinks the shadow of his disciple away. “Gongyi Xiao?”</p><p>“Is Elder Shen feeling any better today?” Gongyi Xiao greets amiably as he enters, holding a tray carefully in his hands with a brown ceramic bowl sitting in the middle of it. Then, he settles the tray down at the table in the middle of the room, before carefully bringing the bowl over to where Shen Qingqiu sat, leaning upright against the headrest of the bed.</p><p>“Mm, about as much as you would expect,” Shen Qingqiu replies, voice soft, feeling his breath coming out weak and raspy from his fever. Then, he gratefully accepts the bowl of medicine from Gongyi Xiao, holding back the urge to crinkle his nose at the bitterness drifting into the air. “Binghe is out looking for a cure again?” He asks cursorily, even when he already knows the answer.</p><p>“Elder Shen is wise, that is indeed the case,” Gongyi Xiao affirms brightly, perking up slightly. He stands earnestly some distance away from the bed, near the folding fans of the room where the sunlight shimmers off the silver lining of his robes.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu winces, feeling the constant, mild throbbing in his temples suddenly flare at the stimuli. Nevertheless, he lifts the bowl to sip at his medicine as coolly as he can, only pausing a bit in between to avoid scalding his tongue. No matter what, his Binghe is still the best… Why is the medicine so scalding hot, is Gongyi Xiao actually trying to burn his lips off???</p><p>Then, feeling his hand starting to tremble slightly from the effort of holding the bowl up, Shen Qingqiu inconspicuously settles it atop the sheets on his lap. Then, his lips curve up fondly. “For a head disciple, Binghe sure does have quite a bit of free time,” he muses, remembering all the time Luo Binghe has stayed faithfully by his side and tended to him. Then, he pauses, a thought only just occurring to him. “Actually, does the Old Palace Master not have any issues against this?”</p><p>Gongyi Xiao blinks in confusion. “The Old Palace Master? Is Elder Shen referring to Shizun?” He echoes, before slowly shaking his head. “This humble one isn’t too sure as to what Elder Shen is speaking of…? Luo-shixiong has never been the head disciple…?” Then, Gongyi Xiao blinks again, even more perplexed. “Actually, <em> I’m </em>the head disciple…?”</p><p>Dumbfounded, Shen Qingqiu stares in silence.</p><p>“This…” Gongyi Xiao begins, looking equally as bewildered. “...Luo-shixiong is highly capable and talented beyond measure, with impeccable conduct and outstanding spiritual qi— even this humble one is unable to compare to him,” he explains slowly, and even looks slightly sheepish at having to speak of his own inadequacy. </p><p>“Shizun is very fond of Luo-shixiong and <em> does </em>hold him in high regard, but Luo-shixiong has always been very insistent that he will only ever have one Shizun… and only one.” His eyes flit nervously to Shen Qingqiu as he speaks, who is all but gaping at him. </p><p>“This humble one isn’t too sure why Luo-shixiong has been so insistent on keeping you in trial, but if it weren’t for Luo-shixiong’s regard for Elder Shen as his disciple, I’m afraid being head disciple would only be a far-fetched dream of mine.”</p><p>Then, he pauses. </p><p>“Did… Did Luo-shixiong tell you he was head disciple?” He prompts hesitantly.</p><p>“...No,” Shen Qingqiu eventually croaks out, feeling his mind reel from this new tidbit of information.</p><p>No, he really hadn’t.</p><p>Had it all been his assumption, then…? </p><p>When Shen Qingqiu had asked this of Binghe back then at the water prison, somehow his question had never really been answered because of how the situation had unfolded— but Shen Qingqiu can still remember, with a burning clarity, the words that had left Luo Binghe’s twisted lips that had seared a fire within him— made his heart clench and twist in all the ways that ripped his breath away from him, made him struggle to speak past the lump in his throat—</p><p> </p><p align="center"><em> “Shizun is Shizun, no matter what.” </em> <em><br/>
</em><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>...And even though his Binghe had said this with a wry, bitter smile, even though he had been still wrought with anger enveloping all of his hurt, he had still steadfastly insisted that he’d only ever wanted a single person as his Shizun, that he only ever wanted <em> Shen Qingqiu </em>himself, as his Shizun.</p><p>Maybe it wasn’t anything direly major, but to think that he had misunderstood this of his Binghe as well...</p><p>Shen Qingqiu draws in a shaky breath, feels it sit heavily in his lungs. </p><p>He can’t help but wonder exactly how much more of Binghe’s quiet desperation and silent pleas he’d missed in his blindness when he’d viewed his precious disciple under the lens of the original PIDW all this time. He wonders just exactly how many pieces of Binghe’s heart that he’d missed, and he wonders about all of Binghe’s sides that he’s failed to see.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu’s heart burns, and he <em> longs. </em></p><hr/><p>It’s a few days later that Shen Qingqiu finds himself slowly strolling through a tumbled stone pathway, with a cloak draped heavily over his shoulders, and Luo Binghe by his side. Like watercolour seeping and blooming onto a canvas, the greenery that surrounds them are in full flush; spring flowers blossoming on the branches with early morning dew and scattering around them in pastel hues as they tread their way through the gravelly stone pathway.</p><p>Yet, even with the beauty of an early spring and all the tranquilness that comes with it, Shen Qingqiu is still starkly aware of his own constitution; of the icy burn in his lungs and the feverish heat simmering within his chest, of how his steps are slow and unsteady even when he’s gripping tightly onto Luo Binghe’s arm for support.</p><p>For Shen Qingqiu, just simply walking feels like a constant uphill battle, with the way his breath is leaving him in stuttered pants and how his thighs tremble with every step. When he closes his eyes, he can still see the soft pastels of the flowers blooming in his mind, yet his head still throbs and his vision still sways even beneath closed eyes— the soft, elegant colours of the early spring feels more like a mocking travesty, the more he walks.</p><p>It’s something Luo Binghe must have noticed, for he abruptly slows to a stop and tightens his grip imperceptibly on Shen Qingqiu’s arm. When Shen Qingqiu pauses along with him and looks back, Luo Binghe is standing right in the middle of the tumbled walkway, dressed in his striking colours of red and black, framed by the scattering petals and blossoming branches. His hair tumbles loosely down his shoulders and flutters slightly with the breeze like how the petals surrounding him falls softly to the ground; it’s an image that sears itself into Shen Qingqiu’s mind.</p><p>Nevertheless, he blinks the image away, and tilts his head curiously.</p><p>“Binghe?”</p><p>Luo Binghe stares at him contemplatively with furrowed brows and concern glittering in his eyes. Their arms are still intertwined, and Shen Qingqiu lets it be.</p><p>“Shizun shouldn’t push himself any further than this,” he speaks up eventually after a moment or two, biting his lip. A stray petal flutters and lands atop of Binghe’s head, and Shen Qingqiu wrangles down his urge to reach out and pluck the petal off his hair. “If Shizun is willing, this disciple’s sword is capable of taking us to the forest clearing. There is no need for Shizun to exert himself beyond necessary.”</p><p>Distracted, Shen Qingqiu blinks, and trails his gaze back down from that stray petal to meet Binghe’s eyes. His disciple looks entirely serious, like he hadn’t just offered to tear open a rift in the middle of a perfectly tranquil and scenic forest trail just so that Shen Qingqiu wouldn’t have to continue walking. Then, Shen Qingqiu’s gaze flits further downwards to Xin Mo hung casually over his hip, fully sheathed. “Binghe is referring to… that demonic sword of yours?” He rasps out, feeling a little amused.</p><p>Luo Binghe nods. “Shizun, please allow this disciple to use Xin Mo instead,” he continues, trailing his fingers lightly over Xin Mo’s hilt. “Wherever Shizun would like to go, this disciple can easily take you there. Shizun doesn’t have to— Shizun really shouldn’t be walking out in the open like this—”</p><p>“—Binghe worries too much,” Shen Qingqiu hides an amused smile behind his fan, feeling the cool spring breeze flutter past his hair. The sun dapples through the rustling leaves of the trees, catches onto his skin with a glimmering sparkle. </p><p>In his adoration elicited from Luo Binghe’s concern, Shen Qingqiu momentarily forgets himself, and reaches out to pluck the stray petal off his disciple’s hair; a soft pink darkening into a full blush at its base, velvety smooth when he rubs his fingers lightly over it. He freezes partway into his action only after noticing that Luo Binghe has gone entirely still, but by then, it was far too late— Shen Qingqiu had already gingerly plucked the petal off his hair, and out of sheer habitual instincts, he had even went as far as to pat Binghe evenly on his head. </p><p>When his eyes snap over to meet Luo Binghe’s gaze again, his disciple is only staring at him with wide, astonished eyes— that very same look of an astonished disbelief spreading across his face as all those other times Shen Qingqiu had touched him of his own accord.</p><p>Mortified, Shen Qingqiu lets out a nervous cough behind his fan, and immediately darts his eyes away as he retracts his hand. “This master appreciates Binghe’s concern, but using that sword of yours will only garner unnecessary attention. Isn’t Binghe trying to blend in with the human cultivators?”</p><p>Luo Binghe ducks his head back down. “Nothing matters more to this disciple than Shizun’s comfort,” he immediately replies, matter-of-factly. “Shizun wouldn’t be exerting himself at all, if this disciple could help it.”</p><p>Stunned by his disciple’s overprotectiveness, Shen Qingqiu can only stare blankly for a few seconds. “This master is ill, not disabled,” he eventually manages hoarsely, snapping his fan shut. Asking the stallion protagonist to whip out his OP demonic sword in the middle of Huan Hua was just asking for trouble to happen; Shen Qingqiu already had enough on his plate as it was! </p><p>“Using Xin Mo would cause more trouble than not,” Shen Qingqiu continues to explain, tugging on Luo Binghe’s arm lightly as he turns to continue his tragically strenuous stroll. Luo Binghe matches his pace, and follows diligently by his side. “Binghe need not be so concerned; it’s good to take a walk every now and then.”</p><p>And technically, he really wasn’t lying. After all, it’s been a long time since he’s had a chance to feel the ground beneath his feet, feel the gravely bumps and hear the crackle of the dried sun leaves as he walks on tumbled stones and all the dirtied soil and fresh grass that lay in between. When he walks, the open wind feels immeasurably good against his skin even though it brings along with it an icy chill that seems to settle in the depths of his bones. Yet even with the strain of the physical exertion taking a toll on his body, somehow Shen Qingqiu still feels lighter than he’s ever had in ages. </p><p>When they resume walking, Binghe’s grip on his arm remains firm and unwavering, but he loops his other arm gently across his waist, steadying him from behind as he walks. Despite this, even with Binghe’s comforting presence and his steady support holding him up, Shen Qingqiu still ends up staggering a little as he walks, and even leans a little too heavily against Binghe’s broad chest that he’s almost certain that Luo Binghe is pretty much carrying all his weight. Yet his disciple remains faithfully silent, only choosing to hold him closer until Shen Qingqiu is quite literally in his embrace, with Luo Binghe’s fingers curled firmly around his waist, pressing him in.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu would have died from embarrassment if it weren’t for his physical pain settling at the forefront of his mind; the way his lungs are burning pitifully in his chest, the way his body is giving out just from the mere act of walking. The cruel reality that is the fleetingness of his life sinks further into his mind with every step forward that he takes, yet Shen Qingqiu only resolutely presses on even when his muscles flare in protest and his vision starts to dim, for this was something Shen Qingqiu wanted to do while he still <em>could</em>— to walk on his own two feet and feel the ground beneath him for however long he can, to stand upright surrounded by the scattering of petals and the rustling of the leaves and feel for himself the wind tracing soothingly across his skin.</p><p>Afterall, it’s probably something Shen Qingqiu would never get the chance to experience ever again. Time always seemed like a fickle, whimsical thing; many times over, he’d asked himself, why did the seasons never seem to pass equally? Winter always reigns like a never-ending regime and spring always departs ephemeral and fleeting; Shen Qingqiu longed for moments like this to <em> stay</em>, yet time only slips by faster the more he fervently wishes for it. The moments when he’s in pain never seem to pass quickly enough, yet when he’s chasing after days and hours of his life like this, time never seems to <em> ever </em>be enough.</p><p>Nevertheless, the fact remains that Shen Qingqiu <em> is </em>starting to feel more than a little exhausted from the physical exertion; the more he walks, the more his knees buckle even with Luo Binghe holding up his weight, and he stumbles even more with every shaky step he takes. The spring wind that brushes across his cheeks feels more like a cold draft of air, seeping into his bones even with the heavy cloak that Luo Binghe had carefully draped across his shoulders just before they’d left for the forest.</p><p>“Shizun,” Luo Binghe protests again even as he diligently continues walking alongside Shen Qingqiu. His fingers twitches slightly against Shen Qingqiu’s arm, and when Shen Qingqiu surreptitiously sneaks a glance at him, Luo Binghe has his brows scrunched up into a frown, looking at him like he was currently committing a grievous crime.</p><p>His disciple looks so aggrieved like this, it was actually kind of adorable. With his demonic mark no longer visible now that they were out in the open, Luo Binghe looks exactly like how Shen Qingqiu had imagined that young child he’d once raised would grow up into if he never had to experience the cruel whims of the system and all the hardships of that the world bestowed upon him. That same child who he’s hurt and cruelly tossed aside, that youth whose smiles were as warm as the sun and eyes that shone like the stars— grown into the image of the man standing right before him now, but with bright warmth sparking in the depth of his eyes instead of all the scars of betrayal and hurt that Shen Qingqiu had engraved into his heart.</p><p>Feeling part amused and part melancholic, Shen Qingqiu lets out a huff, feeling the hem of his cloak flutter as the wind grazes past them. Luo Binghe immediately reaches out to tighten the cloak around his shoulders, and Shen Qingqiu lets him, in a fashion similar to how he’d let Binghe drape the cloak around his shoulders just before they’d headed out of the room. </p><p>“Using Xin Mo is out of the question,” Shen Qingqiu finds himself relenting. “If Binghe is so insistent about this, how else would Binghe suggest we get to the clearing, then?” He muses.</p><p>Luo Binghe stares at him for a moment or two.</p><p>“Shizun is saying that this disciple only has to find a way that does not involve using Xin Mo?” He clarifies.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu immediately feels uneasy. “No flying on swords, either,” he pauses, then continues. “Or calling for a carriage. Or a horse.” Then, feeling like it’s safer to just blanket-ban any possible ridiculous ideas that might stem from the protagonist’s mind, Shen Qingqiu firmly adds, “Nothing too ostentatious.”</p><p>Luo Binghe blinks. “This disciple understands.”</p><p>Then, all of a sudden, Luo Binghe leans down, slipping his arm beneath his knees and looping his other across his back in one smooth movement, before Shen Qingqiu feels his entire weight shifting as he’s suddenly lifted off the ground. The abruptness of Luo Binghe’s actions immediately makes his mind go blank; the moment his vision clears and he comes back to his senses, Luo Binghe is already carrying him firmly in his arms, pressing him closely to his chest. </p><p>In a way, it’s very much similar to that previous time in the water prison, when Luo Binghe had forcibly carried him in his arms while his veins had still been numb from Binghe’s blood parasites. But this time, the heat radiating from Binghe feels like a scorching warmth against his skin instead of the icy chill he’d felt pulsing from within. Now, Binghe’s, low, simmering warmth trails up to his neck and burns hotly at the shell of his ears, and Shen Qingqiu’s arms instinctively come up to loop around Luo Binghe’s neck— when he had only been bound helplessly with the cables the previous time Luo Binghe had held him within his arms.</p><p>And this time, Shen Qingqiu does not stiffen in fear.</p><p>Instead, Shen Qingqiu immediately flushes scarlet, and panics. </p><p>
<em> Bridal carry?!?!?!? </em>
</p><p>“Luo Binghe!” He seethes, cheeks burning all the way to his ears. Mortified, he snaps his fan close and whacks the top of Luo Binghe’s head once with it, and then another when he decides that only once is not enough to make up for the flood of embarrassment coursing through his veins. Heart thumping wildly in his chest, Shen Qingqiu hisses, “You put me down right now!”</p><p>“Shizun shouldn’t go back on his words,” Luo Binghe immediately replies, and casually starts treading through the tumbled stone path again. The sheer nonchalance of his actions has Shen Qingqiu gaping helplessly like a fish as he squirms in Luo Binghe’s hold, but the blackened protagonist only tightens his grip, and pulls him in closer. </p><p>“But Shizun, you <em> promised. </em>Is Shizun planning on lying to this disciple again?” Luo Binghe looks aggrieved again. The words that so casually leaves his lips digs painfully into Shen Qingqiu’s heart, but Luo Binghe only continues shooting him that woeful look, like Shen Qingqiu was acting particularly difficult. It’s an expression that Shen Qingqiu vividly remembers shooting his white lotus once; when he’d carried a young and frantically struggling Luo Binghe in his arms after he’d thrown himself into the cold pool after being seemingly scarred and traumatised by Shen Qingqiu’s motherly concern.</p><p>Belatedly, he wonders if Luo Binghe had felt, in that moment, exactly the same way as he did now.</p><p>But before Shen Qingqiu could even begin his petulant protest, Luo Binghe’s grip around his waist tightens imperceptibly again, almost possessive. “Please stop struggling, this disciple is afraid Shizun will fall and hurt himself,” he adds, looking wronged.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu feels another wave of helplessness wash over him at Luo Binghe’s worry-filled gaze— he’s holding onto him so tightly Shen Qingqiu couldn’t even breathe properly; how was he supposed to fall!</p><p>“Can’t you…” Shen Qingqiu says weakly, then swallows with difficulty. “Can’t Binghe carry me on your back instead? This method is really too…” </p><p>Too shameless!!! Shen Qingqiu only got bridal carried by his family and occasionally muscular nurses back in his past life when they shifted him onto the bed in his hospital ward when he’d been completely immobile, but never like this!!!</p><p>“This way is safer,” Luo Binghe insists. “What if a stray branch hit Shizun from behind? This disciple wouldn’t be able to see if that were to be the case.”</p><p>“...”</p><p>Cheeks still tinged red, Shen Qingqiu slumps defeatedly into Luo Binghe’s embrace, arms still laced around his neck. In times like this, he can’t help but wish he could infuse spiritual qi into his fan, so that it could float and he could hide his paper-thin face behind it even when he had no free hands.</p><p>Nevertheless, with Luo Binghe holding him firmly in his arms, they eventually manages to reach the forest clearing at a much faster speed than it would have originally taken them if Shen Qingqiu had stubbornly persisted in crawling his way here. Luo Binghe gingerly settles him down atop a flat rock situated in the middle of a field of flowers, to which Shen Qingqiu immediately flicks his trusty fan open to hide his face with, before his disciple proceeds to dust him off at the hem of his robes and even at the edge of his sleeves. Once he’s done, Luo Binghe settles himself a fair distance away, folding his legs underneath him in a kneel.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu immediately frowns.</p><p>“What is Binghe kneeling so far for? Come closer.”</p><p>Luo Binghe blinks, but obediently maneuvers himself so that he’s kneeling just before Shen Qingqiu. “Does Shizun require anything from this disciple?”</p><p>Shen Qingqiu hums thoughtfully, feeling the burning ache in his calves quell just the slightest bit. Spring flowers rustle in the wind as he sits in the middle of the forest clearing, and he can hear the light chirping of birdsongs and crickets in the far-off distance. It’s a calm, soothing lull that calms his mind even when the wind feels a little too cold and his vision still swirls when he closes his eyes.</p><p>It’s nice, to be here with his disciple like this.</p><p>“Binghe can be at ease, this master only wanted to relax outdoors,” Shen Qingqiu answers, fluttering his fan idly before his face. When he breathes, he can smell the light floral fragrance of the flowers and the smell of grass fresh after the rain, but his lungs still continues its burning itch.</p><p>“Shizun finds himself unable to relax indoors?” Luo Binghe immediately asks with a frown, looking like he was just seconds away from bolting upright and fixing whatever that he found unsatisfactory with the room Shen Qingqiu had been staying in. </p><p>Shen Qingqiu coughs once, before thumping him over the head lightly with his fan. “That’s too extreme an extrapolation,” he chides, and when Binghe looks at him disbelievingly, Shen Qingqiu stifles a smile. “Does Binghe not think that this is a welcome change of pace?”</p><p>“Any time spent with Shizun is welcome,” Luo Binghe steadfastly replies.</p><p>“...”</p><p>Why did talking to Luo Binghe feel like he was talking to a brick wall…?</p><p>Shen Qingqiu lets out a sigh, feeling slightly defeated, but when he averts his gaze, he catches sight of pear blossoms scattered across the meadows where he’s sitting. They’re a dainty little thing, brilliantly white with pale yellow stamens peeking out from the middle of it, amidst the verdant green of the meadows and the soft pinks of the plum blossoms scattered all around, Shen Qingqiu can’t help but reach out for it. </p><p>Between the tip of his fingers, the petals of the pear blossom brushes over his knuckles. Shen Qingqiu hums, and on a whim, tucks the pear blossom into Luo Binghe’s hair. His blackened protagonist's hair is still draped in loose waves, curling around his shoulders. With the white pear blossom tucked in his hair at his ear, Luo Binghe looks completely out of his element.</p><p>Luo Binghe blinks.</p><p>“...Shizun?” He calls hesitantly.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu waves his fan again. “Punishment,” he says coolly, somehow still managing to sound composed even while he’s gleefully cackling away in his mind. The stallion protagonist with a flower tucked into his hair like a maiden; the original Luo Binghe from PIDW will never be caught dead looking like this!!</p><p>Luo Binghe’s hand comes up to gingerly touch the flower that Shen Qingqiu had pressed into his hair, not comprehending in the slightest. “Punishment, Shizun?” He repeats, looking astonished like he could not believe for a second that his shizun, who had tossed him into the abyss without rhyme nor reason, would all but carefully tuck a flower into his hair and call it punishment.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu nods wisely, unaware of the thoughts running through his blackened protagonist’s mind.</p><p>An eye for an eye! This was for making him go through that sheer mortification of having to be bridal-carried!!</p><p>“Binghe ignored this master’s commands to be released. For your disobedience, this is a fitting punishment,” Shen Qingqiu clarifies, all the while holding back a cough. Then, with a pointed eye and a childish vehemence, he adds, “Binghe is not to take it out until this master tells you otherwise.”</p><p>Luo Binghe nods agreeingly, and weirdly enough, he even looks slightly happy. For what reason Shen Qingqiu really wasn’t too sure, but perhaps his disciple had more of a maiden heart than he’d originally thought he did, and actually liked wearing stuff like this…?</p><p>“This disciple will listen to whatever Shizun says,” Luo Binghe agrees. Then, he pauses. “Then, does the flower look good on this disciple, Shizun?”</p><p>Shen Qingqiu blinks.</p><p>Could it… Could it really be the case?! The stallion protagonist, who managed to gain over 600 wives in his harem, actually always had a liking for such flowery accessories??? That Shen Qingqiu had no clue until now— he’s really neglected his disciple in so many ways!!</p><p>Holding back a sigh, Shen Qingqiu pats him again on his head, ignoring the slight tickle in his throat and the way his lungs constrict when he speaks. “It suits Binghe very much,” he answers placatingly, and then stifles another burning cough. </p><p>And the way Luo Binghe looks at him— Shen Qingqiu feels his heart clench painfully. How could mere words make Binghe look at him like that, after— after everything Shen Qingqiu has done? Yet his disciple looks at him like he’s plucked stars from the sky and placed them within his palm, when all he did was to tuck some random dead flower lying on the grass into his hair.</p><p>And Shen Qingqiu can’t help but wonder exactly how hurt his disciple must have felt when he’d pushed him down into the abyss, especially now that he’s slowly becoming more aware that his every action and his every word were worth more than precious gemstones in Luo Binghe’s eyes.</p><p>In the midst of his thoughts, Luo Binghe’s gaze flutters almost shyly back to the floor. “...Since Shizun likes it, then this disciple doesn’t mind wearing it, even if it’s ‘punishment’,” he says with a soft smile, looking oddly fetching even when his words are tinged with a strange hint of wry amusement. Nevertheless, Luo Binghe still looks fondly content, and makes no move to remove the pear blossom in his hair. </p><p>Then, Luo Binghe stands, and smoothens down the crinkles and folds in his robe. “Then, as atonement, this disciple will endeavor to find a matching one that suits Shizun,” he says, that same hint of a smile grazing past his face as he looks down at Shen Qingqiu who was still sitting atop the flat rock. “Please wait for me, Shizun, this disciple will make sure to be quick.”</p><p>Then, Luo Binghe wanders further off into the distance of the forest clearing, leaving Shen Qingqiu sitting all alone on that rock, drowning in his guilt that has yet to settle. His heart is still constricting painfully in his chest, that same tickle burning in his lungs and crawling its way up to that sickening lump lodged tightly within his throat.</p><p>The more time he spends watching Luo Binghe’s retreating back, the more his vision narrows into dark rings, constricting and shrinking until he can only see blurry dim circles of the flower fields in the distance. It’s not until a single cough escapes his lips and his shoulders start to tremble, that the itch in his chest and the burning in his lungs starts to make sense and Shen Qingqiu finally realises that he’s descending into a coughing fit— one that had only appeared in the final moments of his previous life. Shen Qingqiu crumples into himself, the wet coughs wracking through his body as he covers his mouth with the palm of his hand.</p><p>It consumes him as fast as all of his other relapses; the loud ringing in his ears and the way the dark rings in his vision pulses and rapidly eclipses into a complete black. Yet the visage of Luo Binghe’s figure retreating into the distance still remains, the soft, pastel hues of the flowers scattered on the ground searing mockingly into his mind.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu lets out another harsh, wet cough, and sputters helplessly into his hand. </p><p>In the throes of his helplessness, Shen Qingqiu can only vaguely hear Luo Binghe’s frantic calls coming from a distance away, the frenzied sounds of his feet shuffling across the grass as he hastily stumbles his way back to him. Every breath that he takes hitches painfully in his lungs and breaks off into the choked-out coughs that tears viciously at his throat, and Shen Qingqiu tears up, just a little—</p><p>—before a warm, comforting arm suddenly pulls him into an embrace, holding him as he shakes. </p><p>“Shizun,” Luo Binghe breathes, and shakily curls his fingers around his wrist. “<em>Shizun</em>—” </p><p>Laced with frantic desperation, Luo Binghe’s voice pierces through the loud ringing in his ears, twisting painfully at his heart. Even amidst all his breathless gasps and the vicious coughs that make him shake and crumple to his knees, Shen Qingqiu can still feel the way Binghe’s fingers tremble against his wrist, hear the way his voice quivers with a poorly concealed distress. </p><p>Yet even then, Shen Qingqiu is entirely powerless against the harshness of the coughing fit that wracks through his entire frame; he can only continue to cough feebly into his palm that he’s clasped tightly over his lips, with his shoulders quivering weakly under Luo Binghe’s hold. </p><p>But his precious disciple only clutches at him tighter, holding him closely and dearly enough, that Shen Qingqiu thinks he can even hear his disciple’s heartbeat thrumming frantically along with his own weakly stuttering one. The panic-laden assurances and desperate murmurs that spilling endlessly from Luo Binghe’s lips and brushing against his ear only made Shen Qingqiu fervently wish that he could chase all of Binghe’s fears away— but like all other times, Shen Qingqiu has <em> always </em>failed spectacularly at this one thing.</p><p>It takes a while, but his coughing does eventually subsides just as a final cough tears its way through Shen Qingqiu’s lungs, a rippling harshness forcing past his throat. But by the time the tremors in his lungs have abated enough for him to settle back into shallow, but still somewhat steady, breaths, the numbness has already spread through his limbs, slowly crawling its way down from the tip of his fingers until his entire arm is numb enough that it gives way under Luo Binghe’s hold—</p><p>—only to reveal a blood-stained palm, crimson red and wet with the colour of life.</p><p>When he looks at his palm, somehow it doesn’t surprise him as much as it should; Shen Qingqiu is more than familiar with his coughing fits that he has already subconsciously expected this, even while he’d been coughing his lungs out. </p><p>But when he reveals his palm, Luo Binghe’s breath hitches. Pressed closely to his side like this, Shen Qingqiu is aware of how his body immediately stills, of the way his precious disciple goes so entirely silent that Shen Qingqiu is afraid to even look up into Luo Binghe’s eyes and see for himself the despair laced in his eyes.</p><p>The pear blossom that he’d tucked into Luo Binghe’s hair has fallen onto the ground.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu stops himself from picking it up.</p><p>Why bother, when he will only end up staining it with his blood…?</p><hr/><p>The flowers that Luo Binghe had picked for him today are cherry blossom flowers.</p><p>It sits by his bedside, right next to his pillow, a single branch leading up to the little pink buds blossoming into tiny, delicate flowers at the tip. Against the linens of the sheets, the petals of the cherry blossoms blooms a soft, pretty pink, intertwining with the paler buds along the branch that has yet to blossom—</p><p>—It’s the first thing Shen Qingqiu sees when he opens his eyes.</p><p>When he picks it up, the bark of the cherry blossom branch feels coarse in between his fingers, the petals of the budding pink blossoms velvety smooth when he traces his thumb along it. In the fog of his memories he can faintly remember passingly mentioning about the blooming of the cherry blossom flowers while he’d been reminiscing to Luo Binghe a few days back and their conversation had drifted off to the forest garden that Shen Qingqiu had always carefully tended to while he was still at Qing Jing peak, but Luo Binghe must have remembered, and brought this back for him, as well.</p><p>And Shen Qingqiu’s been waking up to this, lately.</p><p>Luo Binghe isn’t always there when he wakes, but in his stead, Shen Qingqiu always sees different stalks of flowers and blossoming branches lying right next to his pillow instead. With never a single petal missing, the flowers lying by his bedside are always freshly picked with the petals curled delicately around its stem, looking nothing short of perfect, like Luo Binghe had tenderly and carefully cupped the flowers in his hand or held the branches protectively in his embrace and brought them back in hopes that Shen Qingqiu would be able to see the same beauty of the early spring that he sees while he’s out searching for a cure that never seems to exist.</p><p>And when he’d first asked Luo Binghe about it, the blackened protagonist had only paused in the midst of drawing the curtains to let in the morning sun, before gazing hesitantly at him. <em> “Does Shizun like them?” </em> He’d asked, his eyes flitting over to the haitang held carefully between Shen Qingqiu’s fingers, the soft rays of the sun streaming in and falling around him in golden waves of warmth. <em> “This disciple immediately thought of Shizun when I caught sight of them, so I could only bring them back for Shizun to see as well,” </em> he’d admitted, looking slightly embarrassed. <em> “This disciple only hopes that Shizun finds them pleasing to the eye.” </em></p><p>And then Shen Qingqiu had felt equally embarrassed, for some weird reason. As he absently twirled the haitang blossom between his fingers, he’d felt the warmth creeping up to his neck, flushing at the tip of his ears, but in the end, he’d chalked the heat suffusing in his cheeks to the stifling heat streaming through the open windows of the room instead. Nevertheless, he’d still gingerly patted Luo Binghe on the head when his blackened protagonist had shuffled his way over with his head slightly bowed, before he’d repeatedly warned him to stay away from any weird-looking flowers, and <em> especially </em>not to breathe in any random dubious pollen.</p><p>Because if Luo Binghe returned to him after breathing in some random sex-pollen or god forbid, unknowingly brought back an entire branch of weird sex-pollen flowers instead, Shen Qingqiu would absolutely combust and die <em> immediately. </em></p><p>He… He was just a sickly man who couldn’t even walk without struggling to breathe, okay?! If he became horny because Luo Binghe, with his demonic bloodline and heritage, couldn’t be affected by the pollen and hence unwittingly brought back such shitty papapa plot devices that were literally <em> everywhere </em> in this godforsaken world that Airplane-bro had written, then wouldn’t Shen Qingqiu literally just <em> die </em> on the spot??? His pathetically weak heart would immediately give out from sheer overexertion, and <em> then </em>Shen Qingqiu would die in an inelegant, scandalous fit of horny— Shen Qingqiu’s name would absolutely go down the drain for years to come!! </p><p>Absolutely <em> not!! </em></p><p>So, Shen Qingqiu had very embarrassedly reminded Binghe twice, even, that <em> “Binghe would do well to stay away from any flower he does not recognise”</em>, before his blackened protagonist had finally acquiesced with a rather moody frown. </p><p>And then the days had passed quietly, with Luo Binghe diligently bringing back those little stalks of flowers and blossoming branches, and sometimes even a little trinket or two, like a new bamboo fan that he’d thought his shizun might like, or jade hairpins that he’d thought would look good adorned in his shizun’s hair. But with a sentimentality that Shen Qingqiu didn’t even know he had, he had stuck to using that same fan with the nostalgic bamboo engravings carved onto the wooden guard that Luo Binghe had given him days after he’d first woken up, and that very same ribbon Luo Binghe had first used to tie his hair with after the first time he’d puked. </p><p>Despite that, Luo Binghe hadn’t looked too put off by it, and in fact, had let his lips curve up a little fondly when Shen Qingqiu had stubbornly insisted on using that same old fan and ribbon that Luo Binghe had given him. Nevertheless, his disciple still places all those flowers and little trinkets by his bedside while Shen Qingqiu is asleep— little pieces of the world that his precious disciple has brought back for Shen Qingqiu to see, now that his illness has advanced and his own two legs are no longer able to carry him to the places he wants to go— to be by the sides of the people he wishes to be.</p><p>But, Shen Qingqiu was a sickly man living on borrowed time. And after he dies, he’d be a nameless man who has shed his previous life. In the end, he’d still have to leave Binghe behind. And wouldn’t that be even <em> crueler? </em> To rip out his heart again and again and <em> again</em>— Shen Qingqiu finds that he’s unable to bring himself to do such a thing; to mend his heart with gentle smiles and the tender press of a palm against his head, only to leave his precious disciple all alone again. </p><p>How ironic! Shen Qingqiu can’t help but think.</p><p>In a world filled with cultivation where the people closest to him chases for a chance at forever, there was Shen Qingqiu, whose only wish was to stay by Binghe’s side for a little longer than this. </p><p>Feeling his heart prickle, Shen Qingqiu stifles a sigh, and shifts his gaze to his precious disciple asleep at the other edge of his bed, leaning against the wooden frame with his arms folded loosely across his chest. The warm, amber glow of the firelight flickering away by his bedside falls softly around Luo Binghe’s face as he sleeps. </p><p>In the silence of the night, Shen Qingqiu can hear the soft breaths slipping past Luo Binghe’s lips as he sleeps, a gentle lull amidst the soothing crackle of the candlelight burning away by his bedside. The pleasant heat of that flickering flame atop the candle wick warms his cheeks and dances across his skin from where he sits under the covers of the quilt, and Shen Qingqiu spends a long while staring at his disciple who’s asleep mere inches away. </p><p>Somehow, it feels all so heartbreaking, when Binghe’s illuminated softly by the candlelight like this. Even as he’s peacefully sleeping away, Luo Binghe only looks haggard and worn, with a worried frown pulled taut at his brows and the broad cut of his shoulders pulled into a tense line even as he sleeps. And in all the times that Binghe has returned to his side, Shen Qingqiu can only remember how the desperation and grief is always so starkly obvious in the depths of his eyes, the way his precious disciple will always wordlessly sit by his bedside and grasp silently at his fingers, with exhaustion seeping into the lines of his shoulders and the heavy stench of Xin Mo lingering thickly beneath his skin.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu’s chest aches.</p><p>But he doesn’t quite mull in his melancholic mood for long— a sudden thought abruptly descends upon him, and after thinking it through for a second or two, Shen Qingqiu firmly purses his lips together in a rare display of determination.</p><p>Fine! </p><p>If Binghe refused to take care of himself and listen to his shizun when he told him to rest instead of gallivanting about all the time in the wilderness trying to find random plants to bring home, then his shizun would just have to do it for him! If Luo Binghe felt embarrassed by Shen Qingqiu’s coddling when he wakes up the very next day, then that was no one’s fault but his own for not listening to his shizun in the first place! </p><p>Really, what kind of disciple ignored their shizun’s orders to rest, nowadays? Didn’t disciples usually like to slack off?? Truly, Shen Qingqiu could never really understand the workings of his disciple’s inner mind.</p><p>Hence, with a determination bolstered by indignation, Shen Qingqiu gingerly sets the cherry blossoms back down beside his pillow, making sure to tuck the petals gently when he places the branch onto his bed so that it wouldn’t be crumpled under his own weight, before shuffling around and dragging his quilt over to the other end of the bed right besides where Binghe sat leaning against the wooden frame.</p><p>Then, ever so quietly so that Binghe wouldn’t wake, Shen Qingqiu starts to drape the quilt around them, making sure to tuck Binghe in at the sides and bundle the quilts around his neck so that he wouldn’t feel cold in the middle of the night. His hand comes up to gently cup around the back of Binghe’s head, his fingers slotting perfectly between his hair at his scalp, before he carefully slots the pillow between Binghe’s head and the wooden pillar of the bed.</p><p>Then, feeling a little unsatisfied even after leaning back and spending a long while just silently staring at his sleeping protagonist, Shen Qingqiu lips twists, and he reaches out again to fluff the pillow, adjusting it ever so slightly so that it sits comfortably in the crook of Luo Binghe’s neck— it wouldn’t do if the stallion protagonist woke up with a sore and aching neck, after all! Shen Qingqiu reasoned to himself, giving himself a little pat on the back in his mind.</p><p>But when he’s coddling his disciple and leaning over Binghe so closely like this, Shen Qingqiu can’t help the sudden tender feeling that sweeps over his heart. It squeezes him tightly in his chest, and in a moment of impulsiveness, Shen Qingqiu can’t help but fondly pat the blackened protagonist on his head.</p><p>Then, very carefully so that he doesn’t wake up his sleeping disciple, Shen Qingqiu slots himself beneath the quilts right next to Luo Binghe, but he absolutely <em> does not </em>snuggle up to the cozy warmth radiating from his disciple sitting right beside him. </p><p>But time slowly passes— curled up under the blankets with the warmth of his disciple by his side, Shen Qingqiu’s head eventually sleepily droops to lean against Luo Binghe’s shoulder, and he falls asleep, </p><p>And if he’d fondly pressed his lips to the demon mark glowing softly on Binghe’s forehead in a moment of impulsiveness before snuggling into the quilts, then that… was a secret that only Shen Qingqiu would know.</p><hr/><p>Their first kiss is a tender and sentimental one— a soft press of lips slotting perfectly against his own, the kind that Shen Yuan has always dreamed of back in his previous life; a kiss to the heart, a kiss to dream of a forever upon.</p><p>But in all of Shen Qingqiu’s memories, and the many more that has yet to come, it is also his most heartbreaking one— with salty tears spilling against his cheeks and slipping past his lips, mixed with the bittersweetness of a love that he’s now come to know in this second life of his.</p><p>And in all of Shen Qingqiu’s two entire lifetimes, he’s only ever dared to dream of a tomorrow; of a measly day more to add on to the evanescence that was his life. So, for him to even <em> dare </em> yearn for a forever— isn’t that truly a laughable, <em> pitiful </em>thing for a sickly man like him?</p><p>Yet, the kiss still lingers like a ghostly touch against his lips, warms his heart with the embers of his soul, and Shen Qingqiu can’t help but wish for a forever and more that he can call his own.</p><p>To long for the sweetness of an everyday that lies in between, when he’s only ever really chased to live for just a single second longer than this...</p><p> </p><p align="center">...He’s really become greedy now, hasn’t he…?</p><p align="center">__</p><p>It eventually happens when Shen Qingqiu is no longer able to do much else without Luo Binghe’s help— such as sitting himself upright to lean against the headrest of the bed to look at the warm glow of the afternoon sun streaming into the room, or crawling pathetically off the edges of his bed to feel the smooth lining of the wooden floorboard pressing delicately into the arch of his feet.</p><p>As he is now, even just simply <em> breathing </em>is proving to be a chore, with how he’s always coughing so badly there’s always a perpetual burn in his lungs. </p><p>It makes his breath stutter and his voice weak— turns it into a frail, hoarse tremble when his words spill past his lips and he can only swallow down the blood trickling down the back of his throat as he speaks.</p><p>They’re really only just a few more minor inconveniences in addition to his already extensive list of the many things that he’s now unable to do. In fact, the things that he <em> could </em> do with this frail body of his were actually so little that he could literally count them on a single hand— such as patting Binghe on the head, or thumping Binghe’s head with his fan, or, when he was feeling energetic enough, giving Binghe <em> two(!!) </em>consecutive pats on his head.</p><p>Of course, being reduced to a Binghe-patting machine <em> did </em>have its own perks; Shen Qingqiu had free and unlimited access to fluffiness anytime he wanted, whenever he felt like it. He had fluffiness at his fingertips, and an entire world made of softness at his beckoning— and it was great!</p><p>But being increasingly helpless as the day passed... It still made a world of difference for Shen Qingqiu. After all, he’s never really had a chance to feel before this, what it was like to be able to live ardently on his own— to feel the world for himself, and everything else that came with it. </p><p>So, no matter how unsightly he might seem, he can’t help but still cling tightly onto every silver of autonomy that he has left over his body— over the body that had <em> never </em>actually rightly been his.</p><p>But funnily enough, Luo Binghe’s desperation still overshadows Shen Qingqiu’s own by leaps and bounds. At this point, his blackened disciple has already all but abandoned his fruitless search for a non-existent cure in favour of staying ceaselessly by Shen Qingqiu’s side.</p><p>Luo Binghe is there when he sleeps, and there when he wakes—</p><p>—And without fail, he will <em> always </em> hold onto his hand through the sweltering heat of fleeting, sunny days and the biting chill of restless eventides.</p><p>And the toll that Shen Qingqiu’s deteriorating health has taken on his disciple remains as clear as day; even when his vision swirls and the darkness spreads, Shen Qingqiu is still acutely aware of the way Xin Mo’s demonic tendrils only ever seems to sink deeper into Binghe’s bones, with the murky wisps of an endless darkness drifting and clinging heavily onto Binghe’s shoulders. </p><p>It peaks at the height of his sadness, pulses at the culmination of his desperation— in every way and every angle, Xin Mo’s pulsating darkness that curls around him in viscous, crawling beats only made Luo Binghe look like he was bleeding with sadness and grief.</p><p>And even now, it is still very much the same.</p><p>The way that Luo Binghe handles him; it carves a line of heartache so deeply into his chest, that Shen Qingqiu will find himself remembering this for a lifetime to come— the slight tremble of Binghe’s fingers as he gingerly smooths a hand to cup at his cheek, the soft press of his lips when he leans down to gently pry open his lips. </p><p>The medicine that trickles past from Luo Binghe’s gentle kisses is as bitter as Shen Qingqiu remembers it to be, with a hint of saltiness that Shen Qingqiu now knows to be the taste of Binghe’s tear-stained lips. Along with the tender caresses of heartbreak, he can also feel the butterfly brushes of Binghe’s lashes tickling his skin, wet with the tears that fall like glimmering pearls onto his cheeks from the reddened rims of his eyes.</p><p>And as Luo Binghe all but cries into his mouth, Shen Qingqiu’s hands come up to weakly fist at the lapels of Luo Binghe’s robes, his fingers brushing across that spot that he’d once thrusted his sword. His heart twists painfully and his chest constricts, but the sadness that has been carved into a searing line into his heart could never compare to the scars he’s engraved into his disciple’s own— etched onto his heart and pierced into his chest, while he’s left with only bloodied claws he’s grown, to sew and to mend.</p><p>But even as he cries, with Xin Mo’s demonic qi sinking into his veins, Luo Binghe curls his fingers so gently around the loose locks of his hair and cradles the back of his head so, <em> so </em>softly that Shen Qingqiu can only find his desperate clumsiness heartbreakingly sweet. It climbs to a peak where his desperation and grief meets, consumes his mind fuelled with Xin Mo by his side— </p><p>—Luo Binghe tenderly and helplessly presses his lips onto Shen Qingqiu’s own, and tremblingly coaxes it open to slip the medicine in.  </p><p>Yet the medicine still dribbles past Shen Qingqiu’s lips and spills onto the corner of his chin with how much Luo Binghe is trembling as he kisses him. </p><p>It’s messy and wet, and all so terribly <em> sad</em>, that Shen Qingqiu feels a painful lump swell in his throat and a warm prickle behind his eyes. When he weakly swallows the medicine from Luo Binghe’s parted lips, it feels more like he’s swallowing all of Binghe’s frantic desperation and his overwhelming love instead, that stays deep within his chest, like a bubbling tide threatening to spill.</p><p>And Luo Binghe does this over and over again, even when a film of tears wells up in Shen Qingqiu’s eyes while he lay flushed and panting weakly underneath him, even when his own mental state has deteriorated to the point where the pulsing waves of his demonic energy starts to tremble in time with the tears that falls from the hazy red of his eyes.</p><p>Luo Binghe only wordlessly lifts the bowl of the medicine to drink another mouthful, before pressing his lips to Shen Qingqiu’s again in another soft kiss. His tongue runs gently across his pliant lips, prying them apart. </p><p>And as Luo Binghe continues passing him mouthfuls of the medicine just like that, the dark wisps of Xin Mo’s pulsating energy continues to surge, until Luo Binghe’s soft kisses eventually starts to turn bruising, and his grip desperate as he clutches tightly onto him.</p><p>—But Luo Binghe falls apart before he even makes it to the end.</p><p>By the time he releases him and Shen Qingqiu flutters his eyes open, the tears are already spilling endlessly from Binghe’s eyes, with his breath coming out in stuttered, quick hitches as he hovers over him. </p><p>When Shen Qingqiu looks at him, Luo Binghe’s expression is contorted into one of clear distraught and anguish, with a helpless loss carved into the depths of his molten red eyes. His tears catches onto his skin and drops wetly onto Shen Qingqiu’s cheeks, mixing with his own that he hadn’t even realised had slipped out of his eyes.</p><p>The bowl of the unfinished medicine slips past Luo Binghe’s slackened fingers, and clatters loudly onto the floor. By the time Shen Qingqiu regains his breath enough for his vision to clear again, the dark tendrils of Xin Mo’s demonic energy has already almost completely wrapped itself around Luo Binghe.</p><p>Luo Binghe is fully crying now, right on the cusp of a qi deviation, and his qi convulses and shudders with every quivering breath and sobs that rattles his chest. Binghe’s vermillion red eyes are but a teary, hazy blur, looking <em> through </em>him like he’s trapped within the labyrinth of his memories, caught within the clasp of his heartbreak.</p><p>“Binghe…?” Shen Qingqiu hoarsely calls through the painful lump in his throat, voice shaky as panic starts to fill his veins when he sees Binghe’s bloodshot eyes, the way the fumes of the demonic qi is starting to seep underneath Binghe’s skin, crawling along his veins and staining them black. When he tries to stand from the bed to reach for his disciple, his legs tremble and buckle uselessly under his own weight, and Shen Qingqiu immediately ends up collapsing back into himself.</p><p>“Shizun,” Luo Binghe trembles as he stares tearily at him, “<em>Shizun. </em>”</p><p>“Shizun is here,” Shen Qingqiu replies. His lips are still tingling from the bruising force of Luo Binghe’s kisses near the end, and the bitter taste of the medicine still lingers on his tongue. Yet, the way his heart twists so painfully when he looks at the distraught clear on Luo Binghe’s face makes Shen Qingqiu shove it all away to the back of his mind. “Binghe, calm your mind,” He tries, as gently as he could, even though every breath that he uses to speak only makes his vision swirl and fade.</p><p>“Shizun, please don’t leave me,” Luo Binghe whispers. “Don’t go anywhere,” he says pleadingly, the tears streaking down his cheeks. “Won’t you please just stay with me?”</p><p>“Shizun isn’t going anywhere,” Shen Qingqiu desperately palcates, trying to calm Luo Binghe enough to pull him out of his haze. Struggling weakly against the useless, frail shell of his now mortal body, he reaches a hand out for Luo Binghe’s sleeve worriedly, “Binghe, you’re going into a qi deviation, you have to—”</p><p>“—<em>Lies,</em>” Consumed by his wildy surging qi, Luo Binghe suddenly cuts him off with a shaky breath, stepping back abruptly like he was suddenly afraid of Shen Qingqiu’s touch. Then, almost as if his mind is only a whirlwind of his past emotions, his voice starts to crack, “Shizun <em> never </em> stays. You never do— Shizun, don’t you remember? <em> You threw me away.” </em></p><p>“Binghe—”</p><p>“—Shizun threw me away,” he repeats again, numbly, “but Shizun, did you know—? Those three years in the abyss, I still thought of Shizun <em> everyday</em>. Every minute. Every second. Every moment, in that cruel hell you threw me in.“ Luo Binghe pauses, and his next words come out hollow. “Shizun, why did you do it?” he whispers again, the demonic tendrils steadily climbing and <em> climbing</em>. “Why did you leave me? Why didn’t you want me?”</p><p>Eyes bloodshot with the billowing fumes of his qi pulsating off his skin, the blood drips off Luo Binghe’s claws as he presses them tightly into his palm. “What did I do wrong? Shizun, I don’t want to be a demon— I’ve never wanted to be, but Shizun, I <em> am </em>a demon— is that so wrong?” </p><p>Tears continue to spill from his eyes, down his trembling lips. </p><p>“Why didn’t you kill me?” He cries, clawing at himself as he spirals and the memories start to overtake him. “Without Shizun’s love, I’d rather be dead! Alone in the abyss, I’d rather be dead! Shizun, why couldn’t you have killed me, if you’re just going to throw me away again and <em> again </em> ? Why did you do it? Why didn’t you do it? <em> Shizun</em>—<em>” </em></p><p>—Then, Shen Qingqiu abruptly tugs him down into his chest, the fierceness of his sudden embrace making Luo Binghe’s words choke and die in his throat. With wide-blown eyes teetering on the edge of a panicked loss, Luo Binghe desperately tries to scramble out of Shen Qingqiu’s grip, who only felt like his heart was absolutely crumbling from grief, pierced and shattered by the words that had left Luo Binghe’s lips. </p><p>Nausea rises to the back of his throat, and Shen Qingqiu felt like he was cradling the shattered pieces of Zheng Yang within his arms again. As with the previous time, Shen Qingqiu holds onto him firmly, the way the erratic flares of Binghe’s demonic qi lashing out and cutting into his skin feeling exactly like how the shattered fragments of Zheng Yang’s blade had once dug into his flesh and drawn blood while he had held it in his embrace.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu tucks Binghe’s head protectively into the crook of his neck. </p><p>“This master is sorry,” is the first thing that spills from his lips. His voice comes out airy and breathless, and he even chokes at the end of it from the sheer intensity of his emotions tearing his heart apart— he really should have said this much earlier ago.</p><p>Luo Binghe struggles again, his qi fluctuating and lashing wildly against Shen Qingqiu’s skin, but Shen Qingqiu only cradles him tighter, tangling his hand into the locks of his hair at his scalp, and wrangles down the grief that is bursting from his heart. </p><p>“Binghe had never deserved any of it. I’ve never thought— I’ve never wanted—” Shen Qingqiu struggles, “This master’s actions—” he swallows, “—are inexcusable. That I’ve hurt you to this extent, I am sorry.”</p><p>By the time he’s finished speaking, Luo Binghe is all but trembling minutely in his arms, with his face still buried into the crook of Shen Qingqiu’s neck. Tumbled onto the bed, they look like a complete, utter mess, with tear-stained cheeks and rumpled clothes and the remnants of bitter medicine strewn all over them. </p><p>But Binghe’s surging qi slowly starts to dissipate and quell, and with his face still hidden in Shen Qingqiu’s neck, his hands come up to grasp at the front lapels of Shen Qingqiu’s robes. </p><p>After a long moment of silence, he murmurs weakly, “Shizun… regretted it…?”</p><p>The crook of his neck is wet. “Everyday,” Shen Qingqiu affirms, and patiently waits.</p><p>When Luo Binghe eventually extricates himself from his arms, his eyes are still bloodshot and teary, with the curls of his hair plastered wetly to his face from the sticky trails of his tears that had slowly dried up, but Xin Mo was no longer vibrating in its sheath. The putrid stench of Xin Mo’s demonic energy still lingers heavily in the air, but the visible tendrils and its crawling, billowing fumes has more or less entirely dissipated. </p><p>Shen Qingqiu’s thumb comes up to rub at the corner of Binghe’s red-rimmed eyes. It comes back sticky and wet with the remnants of his disciple’s tears. </p><p>“Is Binghe feeling alright?” Shen Qingqiu inquires softly. His other hand remains firmly entwined with one of Binghe’s, the way they’ve taken to holding each other ever since his life had started approaching its end.</p><p>Wordlessly, Luo Binghe curls his hand tighter around Shen Qingqiu’s and gives a jerky nod, not quite meeting his gaze. His shizun’s hand still feels bony and delicately thin in his own, yet it still provided that same steady, soothing comfort he’d always felt whenever he held his shizun’s hand— whether if it was far in the past when he’d still been a young child, or even now, when he’s all grown and his nails have been replaced with claws, his blood for filth, his bones for the vitriol he had against the world and the world against him—</p><p>—but never his shizun.</p><p>All Luo Binghe had ever wanted was to be by his shizun’s side.</p><p>But now, Shizun is right <em> there</em>, right beside him. </p><p>Shizun had held him in his embrace, he’d cradled him tightly.</p><p>He’d tucked him within his chest, brushed his tears away, and firmly held onto his hand.</p><p>And now, when he looks up tearily into Shen Qingqiu’s concerned gaze, there’s not a single trace of that contempt and disgust he’d imagined on his shizun’s face in the harrowing delusions that he sees sometimes, while he’s overcome with heartbreak and desperation with Xin Mo’s bloodlust feeding into his veins. He finds that it fills him with terror— the way his heart trembles with the slightest hint of happiness, the way it makes him feel a warmth that he’d thought he’d lost forever— could he even <em> believe </em>that he could have this again?</p><p>“Shizun,” Luo Binghe whispers, shakily. </p><p>“Hmm?” Shen Qingqiu hums indulgently, his fingers still carefully wiping away the remnants of his tears and gingerly removing the wet strands of his hair away from his face and tucking them behind his ears.</p><p>“Shizun,” Luo Binghe tries again hesitantly, pleadingly. He wonders if his shizun will understand, when he’s fumbling with his words like this, when he’s now a demon and no longer has a human heart. Yet he still doesn’t quite dare to ask that question burning deep in his heart— </p><p>—What if the shizun he sees before him now, who greets him with soft hums when he wakes and thanks him with a hint of a smile whenever he tucks him in under the covers of the quilt, who had held onto him while he’d been lost in his own qi and wiped away his tears with tender caresses of his thumb—</p><p>—What if they were all just figments of his delusions?</p><p>If his shizun said that he still hated him, what then—?</p><p>An irrational fear bubbles from within, swirls together with all of his cacophony of emotions; of his love and adoration, of his grief and frustration. It’s pathetic how he’s still so very much afraid of his shizun’s rejection, when rejection is all that he knows in this life of his. He should have been numb to the idea of being discarded by now, yet desperation still claws tightly onto his bones, rattles his soul with a scorching heat that makes him want to swallow down his words, smother it down into a tight ball tucked away at a little corner in his chest.</p><p>But his shizun is still coddling over him with those clear, unguarded eyes. </p><p>Smoothing down <em> his </em> hair. Wiping away <em> his </em> tears. Looking at <em> him</em>—</p><p>—and <em> only </em>him.</p><p>“Shizun… don’t often tell me things,” Luo Binghe whispers softly, his chest quivering and squeezing painfully as he thought back to their happier days. “This disciple used to think Shizun’s truth and affections lies in the smiles you gave me sometimes,” breaths uneven, his eyes flutter to the floor. “Your gaze. Your touch. Even when Shizun has never outright spoken a single word about it.”</p><p>“But after...” Luo Binghe trembles, unable to continue as his mind flashes back to the abyss. “Of course, this disciple couldn’t have been more wrong,” he chooses to say with a short laugh instead, the scar on his chest burning when the memories of that desolate hell flashes unbidden into his mind. </p><p>Somehow he feels like he’s falling into the endless abyss all over again, that same harrowing despair clawing at his heart.  </p><p>“Shizun hated me for being a demon, but this disciple… this disciple still wanted all of Shizun’s love. This disciple still wanted—” Luo Binghe falters, his voice cracking, “—to return to Shizun’s side. But if I returned to Shizun as the filthy demon that I am, then wouldn’t Shizun just throw me away again...?” </p><p>Shen Qingqiu’s breath hitches slightly, but lost in his memories, Luo Binghe shakily forges on, the dark sweep of his lashes brushing wetly against the knuckles of Shen Qingqiu's hand still cupped warmly against his cheek. “So this disciple had thought, if I took over Huan Hua, would I become closer to you…? If this disciple became a righteous leader just like Shizun instead of the filthy demon that I am, then would Shizun finally be happy with me again…?” </p><p>Luo Binghe pauses, only to laugh bitterly. </p><p>“But Shizun only ever ran from me. So this disciple had thought that Shizun...Hated me. Despised me and the filthy blood that runs in my veins. So I was hurt, and angry. And so lonely, Shizun, I’ve missed you terribly,” he whispers.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu’s hand stills, hovering right before his cheek. It quivers, and Luo Binghe wonders if his words were affecting his shizun as much as it did him…? But he also remembers that his shizun is ill, that his hands tremble even while clasped firmly in Luo Binghe’s own, and Luo Binghe feels another painful squeeze in his chest.</p><p>“But I’ve never meant to hurt Shizun, I just couldn’t control my anger—!” Luo Binghe continues mumbling, feeling the guilt wrack through him, consuming his mind when he remembers how his hands had been stained red with his shizun’s blood, how his shizun was all but a chillingly limp, cold figure in his arms when he’d carried him out of the water prison. All of Shizun’s broken whispers, Shizun’s tears and his breathless gasps of air, Shizun’s bile and spit, his helpless form and the blood spilling past his lips when he coughed and dyed Luo Binghe’s world in a mocking shade of red. “I was wrong, Shizun, this disciple was wrong, I really— I didn’t mean to—” he whispers, “I’ve never wanted to hurt you.”<em>   </em></p><p>Luo Binghe swallows difficultly, before lifting his gaze to look into Shen Qingqiu’s eyes, who was staring at him heartbrokenly. It twists at his heart, makes him feel a searing heat that burns him to smoldering embers and rotten ashes on the inside. “But Shizun, it hurts to know that I’ve lost the right to even <em> pretend </em>I’m not the filthy demon Shizun deems me as. So, I was angry, and so, very hurt.”</p><p>“And Shizun, it <em> still </em> hurts,” Luo Binghe continues, his breath coming up short. “Shizun cast me away— I was angry, and so very <em> sad. </em>I chased endlessly for answers, and never got a single one of them in return. I was hurt! I was lonely! Shizun, I’ve missed you so, so much—” His voice breaks as he cries, “—But I’ve hurt you! Again and again— Shizun, why don’t you hate me? Scold me, hit me? This disciple has done nothing but hurt you, Shizun, why do you still— why—”</p><p>Luo Binghe crumples into himself, “—Shizun, please, won’t you stop being nice to me?” He says brokenly, his expression contorted. “Shizun’s affections changes as swiftly as the wind, and this disciple no longer dares to guess Shizun’s heart. I’d rather if Shizun hated me, despised me,” —<em>Shizun, please love me</em>— “To fall again from the greatest heights of happiness— this disciple can’t do it again.”</p><p>Shen Qingqiu looks at him like he’s been punched in the gut, his expression twisted into one of anguish that Luo Binghe has never seen before on his shizun’s face, who usually had such a tight reign over his emotions Luo Binghe had once thought him to be carved delicately and made exquisitely out of smooth jade and crystalline glass.</p><p>“<em>Binghe,</em>” Shen Qingqiu calls his name like he’s made out of the shattered pieces of his own heart. “This master—” He fumbles, helplessly. His hand still hovers right above his cheek, then, it slowly comes back down to cup at his cheek again. “I’ve— never hated you,” he says, “Binghe had always been…” he pauses, looking slightly uncomfortable as he speaks, like he’s never had to bare himself like this before— defenseless, exposed, <em> vulnerable. </em> But his shizun presses on, <em> all for him</em>. </p><p>“Binghe has always been... the person closest to me, and this master is always,” he tries, struggling to speak, “wishing for your happiness. It... might have never seemed that way but to this master, Binghe has always... been more than what you deemed yourself as worthy, deserves more... than everything this world has offered you.” Shen Qingqiu swallows, and his thumb brushes across his cheek again. </p><p>How embarrassing, Luo Binghe thinks belatedly, he really should stop crying. How many times would Shizun need to wipe off his tears, if he kept going on like this?</p><p>“This master had thought,” Shen Qingqiu continues difficultly, his slender fingers a light quiver brushing against his cheek, “that Binghe’s anger… would be justified. That Binghe would be... well within his rights,” he swallows again, “to seek recompensation from this master. But that has never been the case, hasn’t it…?” Shen Qingqiu smiles wryly, “It seems like this master has only ever failed Binghe when it counts.”</p><p>Shen Qingqiu’s hand leaves his cheek, and settles warmly atop his head. But Luo Binghe only feels like he’s been splashed with a bucket of ice cold water by the words that had left Shen Qingqiu’s lips, and it drenches him with a freezing, biting chill from within. It twists in his heart, makes him bite his lips bloody even as Shen Qingqiu continues to speak. </p><p>“This master has misunderstood Binghe, and was... cowardly in his actions,” Shen Qingqiu admits, with an unguarded honesty so unlike his shizun’s usual restrained indifference, that it only made the frigid chill turn into a gnawing pain in Luo Binghe’s chest. “Shizun is sorry.”</p><p>
<em> Shizun is sorry.  </em>
</p><p>When the words came from his Shizun lips like that, somehow, Luo Binghe could only feel a twisted sense of heartache welling from within. He can't help but wonder exactly how long he'd been mistaking his shizun's guilt for contempt, and his heartache for derisiveness laced with the poison of hatred...?</p><p>“...Shizun had thought,” the words comes out as a hoarse rasp from Luo Binghe’s throat. When he swallows, it feels akin to sandpaper scraping at him from within; the rawness of all the hurt and anger that he’d felt before, turned into a mocking, numbing chill crawling in his veins. “Shizun had thought that this disciple… would hurt you…? Was that why Shizun was always running— was so afraid of me…? Because Shizun had felt... guilty…?”</p><p>Instead of answering, Shen Qingqiu only pats him gently on the head with a soft, almost wry smile that wringed and twisted at Luo Binghe’s heart. Somehow, his shizun’s every touch against his skin only leaves a burning trail of fire in its wake, and Luo Binghe can only remember all those times he’d longed for his shizun to look back at him, remember all those times he’d chased after his shizun with anger fuelling his every word and his every step, only to be met with a quiet reticence and what he’d thought to be a silent, nonchalant disdain...</p><p>Voice soft, Luo Binghe mumbles, “Shizun has never… hated me…?” </p><p>“Not once,” Shen Qingqiu replies, almost immediately, like he doesn’t even have to <em> think </em> about his reply<em>.  </em></p><p>The stifling pressure in Luo Binghe’s chest suddenly feels all too suffocating. </p><p>“How could I? This master is only ever happy to have Binghe by his side,” Shen Qingqiu admits, his voice sounding far away even to Luo Binghe’s ears, who’d only ever paid rapt attention to his Shizun’s every word and held them closely to his heart. “Rather than hating you, this master...” </p><p>Then, Shen Qingqiu trails off, looking embarrassed and unsure. </p><p>Feeling like his heart had been lit aflame, Luo Binghe feels it slowly spreading warmly in his veins to the tip of his fingers. Yet, the cold still lingers like his heart has been encased in ice, and Luo Binghe only mutedly shakes his head, disbelief thrumming again in his veins with a frigid chill. </p><p>“This disciple is afraid to believe the words that Shizun says,” he mumbles, even though his shizun’s words had lit a soothing flame ablaze in his heart. “Shizun, don’t you know how much your every word, your every smile, and your every touch, means to me?” He says helplessly, and looks upon their intertwined hands, and the veins that dance across his shizun’s fair skin. It’s pale, and Luo Binghe wonders exactly how much life is left within them. </p><p>“This disciple is useless; I’ve always never been able to get anybody to stay,” Luo Binghe murmurs, “and never has anyone… been willing to choose me. So, Shizun, if you’re just going to leave me behind again, then this disciple would rather Shizun not care at all.”</p><p>Shen Qingqiu softens his eyes. </p><p>Then suddenly, there’s a light tap on his nose, and it snaps Luo Binghe out of the thoughts that consumes him. When he blinks and looks back up, it’s like his vision immediately clears and flickers back into view; a brightly lit world stained with the vivid colours blooming around his shizun seated in the center of his world. His shizun is staring fondly at him, a trace of amusement flitting past his eyes. </p><p>But somehow even then, his shizun still looks a little sad. But he was still <em> there</em>, in the center of Luo Binghe’s entire world, with his inky black hair spilling over his shoulders like silk, ivory pale skin the colour of cream, and reddened, bruised lips— like the watercolour of Luo Binghe’s love bleeding onto the canvas that was his world before him.</p><p>“Foolish boy,” Shen Qingqiu chides, and Luo Binghe feels his heart slowly lift. It still feels heavy; the little that’s left of his shizun’s remaining life clinging heavily onto his heart, but Shen Qingqiu’s words and all of his love had always been Luo Binghe’s wings.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu smiles softly.</p><p> </p><p align="center">“Hasn’t this master already chosen you, for the remainder of my life?”</p><hr/><p>“Would Shizun like another cup of tea?”</p><p>Like a ripple in the soothing silence, Luo Binghe’s voice carries over gently to where Shen Qingqiu sat leaning against the wooden frame of the bed. When he blinks, and glances up briefly from the book that he’s been reading, he sees Luo Binghe smiling softly down at him, the iridescent red of his eyes warm with a tenderness that made Shen Qingqiu’s toes curl where his legs dangle off the edges of the bed.</p><p>Standing by his bedside, his stallion protagonist has his hair tied up in a low ponytail, with the ends of it curling in loose waves over the dip of his neck, down his shoulders and tumbling past his back. When Shen Qingqiu looks at him, he can see how the front of Binghe’s hair falls softly to frame the sides of his face, with the stray tufts of his bangs brushing lightly across the faint scarlet of his demonic mark.</p><p>It’s a fresh look that his disciple is currently adorning; a messily tied ponytail hanging over his shoulders, with the red of his ribbon stark against his hair and blending in with the bleeding crimsons and black of his robes fitted snugly over his figure.</p><p>Yet even with such a simple hairdo, Luo Binghe somehow still looks so perfectly immaculate and unfairly good-looking that Shen Qingqiu’s first thought is to flop inelegantly onto his bed (and then ask for Binghe’s help to sit him upright again later), and then throw a rightful, indignant tantrum—</p><p>—All Binghe did was just messily tie his hair up so that they could, according to the stallion protagonist <em> himself</em>, ‘have matching hairstyles’, so why did he have to look so stupidly good???</p><p>How was this fair??</p><p>Whenever Shen Qingqiu did it with that same green ribbon he’d taken to using, he’d only ever managed to look like he was some sickly, old man suffering from a severe case of a balding scalp. But when Binghe did it, suddenly he looked like— like <em> this??? </em></p><p>Shen Qingqiu can’t even look him properly in the eye anymore!!</p><p>Where was the logic? Where was the fairness?!</p><p>Why was this world that that stupid hack of an author wrote so stupidly biased against the unfavoured canon fodders?!</p><p>Shen Qingqiu wanted to riot.</p><p>Nevertheless, when he glances back up to look at Luo Binghe, his blackened lotus is still gazing at him softly, with that same gentle upturn of his lips and his expression so earnestly inquisitive that Shen Qingqiu can’t help but feel the indignation that had been welling within him soften into something more akin to fondness.</p><p>A small, hidden smile makes its way to Shen Qingqiu’s face. Still leaning against the wooden frame of the bed, Shen Qingqiu gingerly slides the book off his lap, his fingers quivering lightly from exertion when it brushes against the spine. “Hadn’t Binghe just prepared one for this master only half a shichen ago?” He teases, coughing once into his sleeve and feeling the familiar, sharp burn in his lungs. “Does Binghe perhaps think of this master as a water bucket to fill?”</p><p>Luo Binghe startles, not expecting for Shen Qingqiu to respond in such a teasing manner. “This disciple just wanted to make sure Shizun is comfortable,” he protests adorably, cheeks flushed. His hair flutters with the wind that drifts in through the slight openings of the windows, and it’s distracting enough that Shen Qingqiu shakily reaches a hand out to tuck a stray strand of his hair behind his ear, before patting him evenly on his head.</p><p>“Oh?” Shen Qingqiu echoes with an elegantly arched brow, and stifles yet another cough. “And here this master thought Binghe was feeling a little restless because this master had been reading his book and ignoring Binghe for too long,” he muses, and watches with a self-satisfied glee when Luo Binghe’s cheek flushes, giving him away. “This master must have been overthinking.”</p><p>“<em>Shizun,</em>” Luo Binghe all but whines, but chooses not to deny, and Shen Qingqiu lets out a short huff of amusement.</p><p>"Well, if Binghe insists,” Shen Qingqiu relents good-naturedly, his lips twitching slightly before he smoothens his expression again. “This master will just have to thank Binghe for his efforts, then,” he says, just as Luo Binghe pushes his head a little more into his palm.</p><p>He indulgently gives him another pat, threading his hand through the fluffy softness of Luo Binghe’s hair and feeling his heart beat a warm pulse when his disciple only smiles softly under his palm. The contentment and sheer delight radiating off Luo Binghe is so starkly obvious that Shen Qingqiu has to visibly restrain himself from squeezing and pinching his cheeks— </p><p>—Shen Qingqiu settles for lightly tapping his fingers against Luo Binghe’s cheek instead. “You’re such a sticky little thing, even at this age,” he says, hummingly, “aren’t you embarrassed?”</p><p>Luo Binghe, who has settled himself into a kneel by Shen Qingqiu’s bedside for his shizun to pat him better, only looks back up at him with wide, doe eyes. “Only for Shizun,” he agrees unabashedly, looking delightfully pleased in no way he should, especially when Shen Qingqiu was admonishing him like this.</p><p>“...”</p><p>Unimpressed, Shen Qingqiu throws caution to the wind, and lightly pinches Luo Binghe’s cheek between his fingers. “Who taught you to be so brazen?” He chides as a small flush spreads across his ears, and ignores the whines that immediately slips out of his blackened lotus’ lips. </p><p>Then, seeing that Luo Binghe was about to part his lips to answer, Shen Qingqiu immediately presses a finger to Luo Binghe lips, interrupting him coolly. “If Binghe answers ‘Shizun’, then Shizun will be very <em> brazenly </em> throwing Binghe out for the day to reflect,” he warns knowingly, despite that same tint of pink still spread lightly across his cheeks, a beguiling shade of Shen Qingqiu’s softness under all of his layers.</p><p>Yet Luo Binghe immediately purses his lips shut, and looks at him with aggrieved eyes.</p><p>In hindsight, if anyone had told Shen Qingqiu just a few weeks ago that he would be playfully teasing his blackened disciple like this, Shen Qingqiu would have scoffed, and then proceed to laugh so hard at the sheer ridiculousness of that audacious statement, that he would’ve ended up coughing and drenching that pitiful messenger in his mouthfuls of blood. Yet here he was, relishing in every moment he could spend with his precious disciple by his side, without the veil of hatred and resentment clouding his eyes, especially after Luo Binghe had all but spilled his feelings just barely a week ago in the haze of his qi deviation.</p><p>It felt like something had settled into place, somehow. </p><p>Luo Binghe still looks upon him in the same, adoring way he’d done before he had his Breakdown<sup>TM</sup>, and sticks faithfully by his side regardless of whether it was night or day, but it still felt a little different from what Shen Qingqiu remembers in all those previous times Luo Binghe had tended to him.</p><p>Now, his touches lingers like a tingling caress across his skin, and his gaze burns like a searing heat that sends shivers down Shen Qingqiu’s spine whenever he met Luo Binghe’s eyes, but more often than not, it was actually Binghe’s incessant clinginess coupled with his shamelessness that only ever made Shen Qingqiu increasingly aware of his disciple’s presence— the broad cut of his muscles shifting underneath his robes, the deftness of his fingers when he entwines it around his own. The heat radiating off his chest when Binghe presses himself against him, the shivers that run down his spine when Luo Binghe wraps his arms around his own from behind his back…</p><p>...Basically, his disciple had gotten so clingy, Shen Qingqiu was quite literally losing his mind.</p><p>This child…! How did he become so unrepentantly shameless?!</p><p>Sure, Luo Binghe had always been a sticky little sheep, and sometimes even blatantly bold in many other ways even while they were neck deep in their misunderstandings and tangled in a yarn ball woven from their mistaken assumptions, but how did Binghe become even clingier than before??? For his clinginess to transcend the realms beyond shamelessness and just stop short before it breached indecency, it was something Shen Qingqiu had even initially thought to be impossible.</p><p>Previously, Luo Binghe had only used to follow him around like a sheep, or worriedly waddle behind him like a neglected duckling, but he had always <em> somewhat </em>kept himself a fair distance away whenever there wasn’t a need for him to physically be in contact with Shen Qingqiu, such as supporting his weight, or steadying him as he hurled or cough.</p><p>Of course, it didn’t discount the times that Luo Binghe <em> had </em> clung onto him tearily while he’d thought him to be asleep, or the times that Luo Binghe had held onto his hand as he slept, <em> or </em>the other times that that Luo Binghe had let his fingers linger at his nape when he anointed his hair with oil.</p><p>Huh, now that he thought about it, maybe Binghe had always been this sticky…?</p><p>But back to the point, now after they’ve had The Talk<sup>TM</sup>, Luo Binghe practically clings onto him like a koala, and looks at him with watery, tear-filled eyes whenever Shen Qingqiu shoo-ed him away (for his own good, really!) so that Binghe could go catch up on his sleep or whatever else he needed to do. Sometimes, the blackened protagonist of his had even outright broken into a waterfall of tears, during the few times when Shen Qingqiu had gotten desperate and requested to be left alone.</p><p>Really, this child of his… What was Shen Qingqiu to do with him?</p><p>Yet it would still be a lie if Shen Qingqiu had said that he wasn’t at all fond of his disciple’s clingy antics; admittedly, it was still kind of cute, in a way.</p><p>But Shen Qingqiu’s heart is made of frail, brittle glass with an allergy to embarrassment; his face is only so thin, he really can’t take any shamelessness more forward than this!</p><p>A warm arm encasing him and circling around his shoulders, or a calloused hand placed firmly to pat soothingly at his back— those, Shen Qingqiu had no qualms against. In fact, he could not be more appreciative of them! The warmth of Binghe’s embrace and the steady grip of his fingers rooting him to this world always managed to chase his darker thoughts away, made every moment he was left helplessly trembling in the aftermath of his own inability a little less harder to bear— made living seem just a little less daunting, when Luo Binghe was by his side.</p><p>But now, Shen Qingqiu is always finding himself having to bat away Luo Binghe’s touches more often than not. Inexplicably, his disciple’s hand is somehow <em> always </em> curled around his hip or his waist one way or another, for absolutely <em> no reason at all</em>, with his fingers lingering against his ears and occasionally even trailing down to brush across his nape whenever Luo Binghe managed to come up with an excuse to fiddle with his hair long enough for him to sneak a touch or two.</p><p>To put his newfound shamelessness into perspective, once, Luo Binghe had even beamed blindingly at him, and said, <em> “This disciple caught sight of a twin-winged sleepy beetle in Shizun’s hair, and thought to get rid of it. Shizun surely knows them to be a crafty bug light on its feet, so it took me a while, but this disciple is sure that Shizun wouldn’t want to sleep with such a demonic bug, would he?”  </em></p><p>Shen Qingqiu had almost blurted out a “a twin-winged <em> what </em> now?”, because that just implied the existence of its counterpart species, but before he could even reply, Luo Binghe had mistaken his perplexity for a begrudging reluctance, and an almost comical, despairing look had slowly dawned onto his face like his entire world had been suddenly upended. <em> “Shizun… would want to sleep with such a demonic bug…?” </em> He’d said glumly, crestfallen like he hadn’t just fabricated an entire demonic bug species. <em> “If Shizun wants to sleep with a demonic bug... then it should only be me.” </em></p><p>Luo Binghe, are you calling yourself a demonic bug right now…</p><p>Anyway, needless to say, Shen Qingqiu had spent quite a long while reprimanding Luo Binghe after that. Certainly, his bite in his reprimands were lacking, as it had always been for that sticky disciple of his. In the end, Shen Qingqiu could only make himself comfortable in their new dynamics, now that Luo Binghe had seemingly evolved into a shameless stallion protagonist with no heed for decorum after their Little IncidentTM.</p><p>One saving grace, though, was Shen Qingqiu’s fan that Luo Binghe had given him. It always comes in handy now, with how Luo Binghe is always pressing himself in so closely that Shen Qingqiu has to use his fan to give him just that little bit of extra distance. If he was embarrassed enough, he only needed to flutter it slightly before his face, which granted him ample space and even something to hide his paper-thin face with, even, so Shen QIngqiu couldn’t help but truly love that fan of his to death and back. </p><p>But lately, Luo Binghe had been starting to eye at his fan with disdain, even though he had been the one who had personally gifted it to Shen Qingqiu barely less than a month ago. His blackened lotus glowered at his fan like it had personally offended him, so much so that Shen Qingqiu was starting to wonder if he should, perhaps, cut down on the usage of his fan and find another way to extricate himself from Luo Binghe’s gentle but insistent touches. He would be deeply saddened if his blackened protagonist eventually decides to bestow upon his fan an undeserving, gruesome death, after all.</p><p>Lost in his thoughts and mourning the (future) loss of his trusty fan, Shen Qingqiu stifles another sigh, which only made Luo Binghe peer back up at him with wide, worried eyes. </p><p>“Is Shizun feeling unwell again?” Luo Binghe asks, furrowing his brows concernedly. “Or is Shizun hungry, perhaps? Shizun hasn’t eaten in a while, should this disciple prepare some snacks for you? Would Shizun like some cold tofu…?” He frets, biting his lip. “Or would Shizun maybe prefer something else?”</p><p>“This master is feeling quite alright,” Shen Qingqiu reassures, and pats him again. “Binghe needn’t be so overly concerned with this master,” he says, and lets his lip curve up again when a familiar warmness sparks in his heart. “After all, hasn’t this master been well lately?” —<em>A lie</em>— “And it’s all due to Binghe’s attentiveness. This master is grateful,” he rubs at Binghe’s head again, just because he could. “If anything, Binghe should be spending less time needlessly fretting, and get more rest instead. The weather seems fine today, why don’t Binghe—”</p><p>—Then, Shen Qingqiu’s throat suddenly goes dry, and his words trail off.</p><p> Luo Binghe’s forehead is suddenly pressed against his own, with the broad palm of his hand gently pushing his bangs back against his hair. His other hand comes up to hold him firmly by his shoulder, his thumb skimming lightly over his skin. Unobstructed by the stray locks of his bangs that were usually within his line of sight and locked into place by Luo Binghe’s gentle hold, Shen Qingqiu can only see Luo Binghe with a startling clarity, his face only mere millimeters away from his own. </p><p>He’s near enough that Shen Qingqiu can see the glittering red of Luo Binghe’s eyes, beautiful and bright and so, <em> so </em>close that Shen Qingqiu can count each and every one of his lashes fluttering against his cheek, see the faint glimmer of his reflection in Luo Binghe’s irises. Luo Binghe’s breath fans warmly against his lips when he exhales, and Shen Qingqiu’s fingers twitches slightly in his lap— He wonders if Luo Binghe can hear the frenzied thumping of his heart, when he was so close to him like this?</p><p>Had Binghe noticed that his breath hitched in his chest?</p><p>Had Binghe noticed that Shen Qingqiu was all but a stunned, flustered mess who could only look helplessly upon his disciple while he himself was frozen into place?</p><p>Could Binghe <em> see </em> the way Shen Qingqiu looks— that very image of himself he sees in Luo Binghe’s eyes; flushed, breathless, and <em> vulnerable </em>?</p><p>What would Luo Binghe do, if he could see for himself the way Shen Qingqiu looked…?</p><p>That single thought brought a rush of nervous anticipation so intense that Shen Qingqiu immediately snaps his fan open with a well-practiced flick of his wrist, and hides his face behind it, flustered beyond belief. It is only then that a hint of embarrassment creeps up on Shen Qingqiu; maybe he had overreacted just a tiny bit…? After all, Luo Binghe would most probably think Shen Qingqiu was feeling ill again; flushed cheeks and rapid heartbeats were common occurrences whenever his fever rose, after all!</p><p>Luo Binghe blinks in surprise at his sudden actions, pulling away slightly. But his fingers are still threaded into Shen Qingqiu’s hair, his thumb still pressing lightly at the dip in Shen Qingqiu’s shoulder.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu swallows nervously, and flutters his fan even more vigorously, his body pulled taut into a stiff, tense line.</p><p>Then, understanding flickers into Luo Binghe’s glittering red eyes, and he blushes slightly in embarrassment. </p><p>“Ah,” Luo Binghe says. “Please don’t mind me, Shizun. This disciple was merely checking if Shizun’s fever had risen, just in case,” he explains, looking delightfully unrepentant even while still blushing like a fair maiden, and proceeds to make no move to extricate himself from Shen Qingqiu’s face.</p><p>Then, holding his gaze nervously as if waiting for Shen Qingqiu to suddenly smack him with the fan, he leans back down again, slowly inching himself forward to press his forehead against Shen Qingqiu’s, who only nervously averted his gaze behind the safety of his fan.</p><p>—<em>Not this again!!! </em> Shen Qingqiu bemoans internally, and continues panicking. <em> Luo Binghe, you keep this up and your Shizun’s fever won’t stay down for long!! </em></p><p>And after what seemed like an eternity when it had actually really only been a few seconds, Luo Binghe eventually bestowed mercy upon Shen Qingqiu, and extricated himself from Shen Qingqiu’s face. He settles back down into a kneel by Shen Qingqiu’s bedside, cheeks still flushed.</p><p>“Shizun feels a little warmer than before,” he says, and even has the audacity to look a little worried despite that red tint still lingering at the tip of his ears. “Shizun, are you sure you’re feeling alright? Should this disciple call for a physician?”</p><p>Shen Qingqiu can only stare at him, feeling high-strung while also incredibly aggrieved.</p><p>...Isn’t this all your fault…</p><p>Shen Qingqiu bites back another sigh. Nevertheless, he waves his fan before his face, relishing in the coolness of the wind that soothed his heated cheeks. Despite this, it wasn’t long before his fingers started trembling and his arm started to ache from the measly weight of his fan, so Shen Qingqiu could only forlornly place his fan down again.</p><p>“This master is fine. It’s just a little warmer today,” he reassures languidly after clearing his throat. Yet Luo Binghe only continues gazing at him with that same worried frown etched onto his face, and Shen Qingqiu feels another flood of warmth filling him again. “Binghe really needn’t worry this much,” Shen Qingqiu smiles fondly, and taps him again on the head with his fan. “Save this Shizun some face, would you?” He teases.</p><p>It works enough that Luo Binghe eventually settles down reluctantly by his bedside, even though Shen Qingqiu had to give him an extra headpat just to placate his blackened lotus. Nevertheless, it was still a more than decent trade-off; his disciple was surprisingly easy to please.</p><p>And after that, time slowly passes, with the spring breeze drifting gently into the room, and Shen Qingqiu just idly gazing at the clouds with Luo Binghe by his side. And because Shen Qingqiu wasn’t actually that particularly interested in cloud-watching and had only been forced to as a result of his illness, his eyes had drifted back to Luo Binghe every so often, and then flitted away back to cloud-watching just as quickly.</p><p>Of course, he also has to stifle coughs into his hand every now and then, and hide the faint traces of the blood that leaves his lips by tucking his blood-stained handkerchief underneath his pillow as inconspicuously as he could. And then intermittently, he’d pause and shift his gaze again, to see Luo Binghe still sitting diligently by his bedside, looking as content as ever to just be by his shizun’s side.</p><p>And it’s not until a shichen or two later, that Shen Qingqiu finally speaks up.</p><p>“Is Binghe not planning to rest?” He asks, worry seeping into his tone as he gingerly snaps his fan shut. Luo Binghe’s eyes flicker back to gaze questioningly at him, and Shen Qingqiu presses his lips into a firm line. “This master isn’t doing anything much, shouldn’t Binghe be using this time to rest instead? Overexerting yourself can only be detrimental,” he reprimands lightly.</p><p>Luo Binghe looks a little unsure. “Is Shizun chasing me away?” He asks hesitantly, and even sounds a little gloomy. “Staying by Shizun’s side is rest enough for this disciple,” he continues, gazing at Shen Qingqiu with stubborn eyes. Then, after a moment of silence, his expression turns a little pained. “Unless Shizun would like for this disciple to leave, then this disciple will reluctantly do so, and then return at Shizun’s earliest convenience.”</p><p>Luo Binghe’s gaze is unwavering, but when Shen Qingqiu looks at him, he can still see the faint traces of the exhaustion clinging onto Binghe’s bones, that same desperation and heartbreak weighing on his shoulders even though it’s by far much lesser than before. But Shen Qingqiu still can’t help but worry for his blackened disciple, when he only ever seemed to care about his shizun and left none of it for himself— the way he’s never been used to, for it was nothing but a foreign concept to the Luo Binghe who had always been subjected to the cruel whims of the world.</p><p>Feeling the familiar ache twisting in his heart, Shen Qingqiu bites at his lip, and silently stares at the image of his blackened disciple for a while, before coming to a conclusion. </p><p>He reaches a hand out to tug at his disciple’s sleeve, pulling him up to sit on the bed right beside him. His strength was by far lacking in comparison to Luo Binghe that he could really only be compared to a weak kitten scrabbling at him, but his beloved disciple only let himself be obediently dragged over to sit on the bed right beside Shen Qingqiu, barely putting up even a show of resistance.</p><p>“Shizun?” Luo Binghe blinks, confusedly.</p><p>Choosing to say nothing for fear that the sheer embarrassment would have him backtracking, Shen Qingqiu purses his lip, then tangles his hand at the back of Binghe’s head, before firmly pulling him down onto his lap. </p><p>Luo Binghe immediately stills, entirely unmoving for a moment or two, as if his brain had completely short-circuited. Then, he started squirming almost frantically in his lap. “Sh-Shizun—!”</p><p>Shen Qingqiu frowns. “Stop fussing, what are you moving about so much for?” he chides, and Luo Binghe immediately stills again. When Shen Qingqiu peers closely at him, he can see the flush spreading all the way to the base of his neck, and another wave of amused fondness rushes up within him, before he ruthlessly squashes it back down again. “Rest,” Shen Qingqiu orders, pushing his embarrassment all the way to the corner of his mind where it will <em> never </em>see the light of the day.</p><p>“But Sh-Shizun, this—” Luo Binghe frantically mumbles, sounding a little lost, his voice muffled where his face is pressed into Shen Qingqiu’s abdomen. When Shen Qingqiu glances down at him, Luo Binghe’s back is crooked awkwardly so that he’d fit into Shen Qingqiu’s bed, with his neck curved in a slant and his entire body locked stiffly that Shen Qingqiu can’t help but feel a sense of pity well up within him— his lap must surely be bony from how ill and skinny he was, and this bed undoubtedly was a little too small to fit Luo Binghe comfortably. No wonder the stallion protagonist was protesting; he was sure to get a crick in his neck if he stayed like this for more than half a shichen.</p><p>Nevertheless, Shen Qingqiu had already thrown his entire face away to offer his sticky black lotus his own lap to rest on; like it or not, Luo Binghe still had to bear with it even if it was uncomfortable. No matter what, it definitely could <em> not </em>beat Shen Qingqiu’s own mortified embarrassment in even considering this to be a viable option, let alone actually doing it.</p><p>“This master is not repeating himself,” he says flatly, and then lets his hand rest on Binghe’s hair, <em> only </em>because there was no other place he could rest it on.</p><p>And because his hand was already there, Shen Qingqiu gently starts non-commitantly threading his fingers through Luo Binghe’s fluffy hair, patting his head while also doing his utmost not to mess up his little ponytail.</p><p>And eventually, Luo Binghe <em> does </em>end up relaxing and happily nuzzling away, even, into Shen Qingqiu’s slow, soothing pats and his less than stellar, bony, and most probably uncomfortable, lap.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu hides a smile. </p><p>When he closes his eyes and leans against the bed frame, he can hear the light chirping of the sparrows. He remembers they’re sitting atop the flowering branches of the yulan magnolia trees outside. They’re in full bloom, now that they’re partway into spring; just yesterday, he recalls seeing white flowering buds flushed pink at their base.</p><p>And Shen Qingqiu… </p><p> </p><p>...Shen Qingqiu has never felt so happy before, to still be alive.</p><hr/><p>But it all falls apart barely a week later; those crumbling pieces of their little moments of happiness scattering around them like the shattered pieces of their hearts, the deluge of blood the colour of life spilling away in a bleeding shade of red.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu has long since prepared himself for this— he has long since already known, that this happiness they shared could never possibly last.</p><p>But on some other times, when he’d woken up in the middle of the night with Luo Binghe’s fingers gently curled around his own, or when he’d furtively snuck a glance at his disciple during the day only to see Luo Binghe’s soft gaze falling upon him with sadness lurking in the shadows of his eyes, he’d also wondered if this could even be considered as happiness, at all?</p><p>In the darkest of their desolation and the brightest of their contentment, they’d found solace in being able to count every minute, every second, every <em> breath </em> they could share. In every moment, they’d counted every second, and in every second, they’d counted every beat of Shen Qingqiu’s weakly thrumming heart; the noose that was Shen Qingqiu’s life had <em> always </em> been wound tightly around their necks, for every breath Shen Qingqiu took only meant that he was a breath <em> closer </em>to his end.</p><p>And for Shen Qingqiu himself, it truly… meant an end. </p><p>If he truly shed his life as Shen Qingqiu, discarded everything when he revives as he was supposedly meant to do, he’d no longer be able to see for himself, the glimmering red of his disciple’s eyes, the breadth of his shoulders and the lines of his jaws. The small furrow in Luo Binghe’s brows, the dark locks of his hair tumbling over his shoulders or that slight curve of his lips when he smiles. Shen Qingqiu adored all of him— his tears and his wayward stickiness, even his unrepentant shamelessness and his tender, affectionate touches. </p><p>But whenever he thinks about everything he’s done, suddenly the cold feels like a harrowing, blistering chill. </p><p>How <em> could </em>he? </p><p>Could he still chase after happiness so shamelessly like this, when all he’s ever done is to hurt that precious child of his…? Yet he still can’t help but long for it, desperately and fervently <em> wish </em> for it. But even if he <em> did, </em>how long more would he be able to scrape for himself...?</p><p>To make Binghe relive the entire process of his death again when he eventually dies from his illness the second <strike> (third) </strike> time, how could Shen Qingqiu even <em> bear? </em></p><p>So, in the end when it came down to it, every silver of happiness they’d desperately chased after, had also always been laced with the heavy weight of heartbreak and a desperate longing if they could have just a little <em> more. </em></p><p>And this— the cruelty of Shen Qingqiu’s fading life, the rawness of an anguished desperation and the despair of being rendered only helpless to the makings of a bitter reality— could never be any clearer, <em> rawer</em>, in anyone else but Luo Binghe; in his tightly wound and increasingly desperate form, in his quivering shoulders and bloodied, bitten lips, in the desolate grief that sunders him apart.</p><p>“Binghe,” Shen Qingqiu’s voice is hoarse when he calls out his disciple’s name. He swallows down the painful prickle in his throat, and takes in the sight of his blackened lotus standing silently by the doorway, with his hands fisted at the sides of his robes.</p><p>Luo Binghe does not respond, nor budge an inch. Instead, he only continues standing rooted by the doorway with his head casted downwards, never quite meeting Shen Qingqiu’s eyes.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu feels a strange twist in his stomach. </p><p>“Binghe,” he calls again, softly. </p><p>This time, Luo Binghe twitches slightly where he stands, even when he’s still gazing resolutely at the floor. From where Shen Qingqiu is seated at the edge of his bed, he can see the way Luo Binghe’s bangs fall lightly over the soft glow of his demonic mark, the way his bangs brushes against his temples and casts shadows over his eyes. It’s an absurd thought that suddenly creeps up on him, but there is nothing Shen Qingqiu wouldn’t give to see that soft, glimmering red of his eyes again.</p><p>For he wishes to burn it into his memories, everything that was <em> Luo Binghe, </em> so that he may remain with him even when he dies.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu swallows again. “Come here,” he finds himself saying, “let this master take a look at you.”</p><p>Binghe only remains silent for a while longer, before he slowly shuffles his way over to Shen Qingqiu, and jerks to a stop when he’s standing right before his shizun. Luo Binghe still has his gaze casted downwards, with his fingers still curled tightly around his robes like he’s vainly struggling not to seize Shen Qingqiu with that same desperation coursing through his veins. </p><p>When Shen Qingqiu looks at him, he can see Xin Mo’s demonic wisps of energy emanating heavily from the pores of his skin. It seeps through his layers of robes like a thick, dense mist, clinging and coiling around his limbs and even slowly crawling up his neck. The mass of the congealed tendrils reeks a putrid stench even when Luo Binghe is standing an arm away, and an implicit understanding immediately dawns upon Shen Qingqiu.</p><p>Xin Mo’s acting up a little more than usual today, it seems.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu stifles a sigh. Nevertheless, he purses his lips, and reaches out a hand to pat comfortingly at Binghe’s cheek. His arm trembles when he lifts it up, and it wrenches another breath out of him that his vision immediately swirls and fades again, but Shen Qingqiu firmly presses his palm against Binghe’s cheek, and holds it there.</p><p>Luo Binghe flinches slightly, his little movement causing Shen Qingqiu’s fingers to curl gently over his ear, brushing against his hair. Luo Binghe’s cheek is warm against his cold fingers, but he immediately settles into his touch despite Xin Mo’s demonic energy feeding off his mind.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu feels that same wave of fond adoration welling up in him again.</p><p>“Binghe seems a little tired today, hmm?” He hums softly, and lets out a smile behind his fan as he pats at Luo Binghe’s cheek. “No matter, let this master take care of you, then.”</p><p>Trailing his fingers from Luo Binghe’s cheek, Shen Qingqiu lets his arm slowly drop back down, with his palm brushing against Binghe’s arm and running lightly down his sleeve. Then, curling his fingers gently around Luo Binghe’s wrists, Shen Qingqiu carefully directs his blackened protagonist into a kneel between his legs, with his back facing him.</p><p>“Shizun…?”</p><p>“Hush,” Shen Qingqiu gently shushes, before stroking him once on his head. Luo Binghe immediately falls back into silence, but Xin Mo’s demonic qi flares again with Shen Qingqiu’s touch. “It’s alright,” Shen Qingqiu murmurs as he distractedly places his fan down by his side. “This master merely wanted to brush Binghe’s hair again. Won’t Binghe indulge this master, hmm?”</p><p>His blackened lotus only remains silent, but makes no move to extricate himself from Shen Qingqiu’s touches otherwise. Despite this, Luo Binghe’s qi continues to pulse wildly from underneath his skin, and Shen Qingqiu can’t help but wonder if Luo Binghe’s continued silence was due to him struggling to suppress Xin Mo’s malevolent energy from corroding his mind— or if it was the culmination of his own overwhelming desperation and grief, compounded as the days went by.</p><p>Nevertheless, Shen Qingqiu reaches out to tug lightly at the red ribbon holding Luo Binghe’s hair together, taking his silence as acquiescence. The ribbon slips out of Binghe’s hair like silk, and no matter how many times Shen Qingqiu had done this before— brushing his disciple’s hair whenever he was feeling down—, he can never help but still find himself entranced by the way Luo Binghe’s hair unravels and tumbles down across his back in loose waves, whenever Shen Qingqiu tugs his ribbon free.</p><p>But Luo Binghe’s qi pulsates again, heavier this time, and Shen Qingqiu sighs.</p><p>“Binghe should take care not to neglect his health,” he starts, running his fingers through Luo Binghe’s hair. Absently, he starts tugging his fingers through Binghe’s curly locks from his scalp to the wavy ends of his hair before combing them behind his ears, his fingers brushing lightly against the shell of Binghe’s ear all the while. There’s barely a tangle even at the ends of Luo Binghe’s fluffy locks of hair, but Shen Qingqiu carefully threads his fingers through them, as well. </p><p>“This master might be ill and require assistance from time to time, but this master still wishes for Binghe to be healthy and well,” he continues distractedly, rubbing lightly at the shell of his ears between his fingers, and ignores the way Luo Binghe’s breath hitches. </p><p>Shen Qingqiu lets out a hum, and without his precious disciple noticing, he slips off his own ribbon as well, letting his own hair down.  Then, as he discreetly starts to braid a small section of Luo Binghe’s hair with it, threading the ribbon into the braid, he briefly wonders how long it would take for his blackened lotus to notice Shen Qingqiu’s small, whimsical act of mischief. </p><p>But he doesn’t manage to dwell on it for long; Luo Binghe’s hair slips from his fingers far too often and the braid unravels far too easily with how badly Shen Qingqiu’s own fingers are trembling. His grip on Luo Binghe’s hair is so unsteady that the braid can only be considered atrociously messy and ill-fitting for someone like Luo Binghe, but Shen Qingqiu presses on determinedly, and continues threading his shaky fingers into Luo Binghe’s hair, struggling with the braid that only ever seems to keep falling apart.</p><p>And by the time he’s done, it’s a laughable sight to behold; the braid is so messy that Shen Qingqiu immediately begins to reconsider letting Luo Binghe out into the public with that sorry excuse of a braid. But when his gaze falls onto his disciple again, he can still see the pulsating wisps of Xin Mo’s malevolent energy coiling around Luo Binghe, thrumming in response to Shen Qingqiu’s gentle touches and fingers tugging at his hair, singing wildly and pulsing viciously under Luo Binghe’s skin. </p><p>Somehow, even with Shen Qingqiu’s careful touches and indulgent care, Xin Mo’s hold on his precious disciple hadn’t dissipated in the slightest, unlike all the other times it had when Luo Binghe had been similarly consumed by Xin Mo’s malevolent energy. This time, it had only continued to wrap itself tighter around his precious disciple, its heavy sludge of an endless black thickly oozing Luo Binghe’s anguished despair.</p><p>An unsettling unease starts to slowly creep into Shen Qingqiu heart; it didn’t usually take this long a session for Luo Binghe to gradually ease out of Xin Mo’s influence, so why did it seem like he was only sinking further into the discord of qi, instead? </p><p>“Binghe…?” Shen Qingqiu calls, hesitantly, reaching a hand out from behind to brush lightly against his disciple’s cheek—</p><p>—and that was all Luo Binghe needed, to tip completely over into his desperation and heartbreak.</p><p>Seemingly unable to hold back his overwhelming sadness tearing his heart apart, Luo Binghe abruptly turns around, and clutches desperately at Shen Qingqiu’s wrist. “—Shizun,” he gasps out breathlessly, tears welling in his eyes as Xin Mo’s demonic qi spreads through his veins and paints them a desolate black. </p><p>When Shen Qingqiu looks at him, Luo Binghe’s glimmering red eyes are wide with a sudden onslaught of tears like he’s no longer able to hold them back, and in the reflection of Binghe’s eyes, there is only the hazy, blurry figure of Shen Qingqiu. “<em>Shizun,</em>” Luo Binghe calls again, his voice trembling. His name falls from Luo Binghe’s lips like a helpless plea, and Shen Qingqiu’s wrist quivers in his hold.</p><p>“Shizun, this disciple can’t—” Luo Binghe breathes, his demonic qi rising and climbing to a peak, “—this disciple can’t— do without you. Without Shizun by my side, I—” he chokes and stumbles, “this disciple can only be well if Shizun is by my side. Whenever I… Whenever this disciple thinks that Shizun…” he shudders, his eyes turning hazy as Xin Mo consumes his mind, “that Shizun is…”</p><p>Unable to bring himself to continue, Luo Binghe bites his lips bloody. “Shizun, what do I have to do, so that you’d stay with me?” He whispers instead, helplessly, sounding so very small. “What do I have to do, so that Shizun won’t leave me?” he continues desperately, murmuring more to himself. His qi shudders with every rattling breath he takes, convulses with every broken sob that wracks through his chest. “Shizun, won’t you just stay with me? If Shizun—” he fumbles, “If Shizun is no longer here, how am I— how is this disciple— how can I even <em> bear </em>to go on…?”</p><p>Luo Binghe’s grip on his wrist is bruising, and his vermillion red eyes wild and hazy. The demonic mark on his forehead is no longer that same soft, glowing red Shen Qingqiu remembers in all those times he woke up to his disciple sleeping by his bedside, but instead, it pulses a fiery, blazing red— the scarlet burning like molten blood. </p><p>Shen Qingqiu’s stomach twists sickeningly. “Binghe, calm your mind, you have to—”</p><p>“—Shizun, Shizun. Did you know...?” Luo Binghe breathes out, barely even registering Shen Qingqiu’s words. “All this disciple ever wanted, is to be by Shizun’s side,” he says tremblingly, the tears spilling endlessly from the bloodied red of his eyes. “So, Shizun, <em> please,</em>” Luo Binghe cries, “won’t you— won’t Shizun tell me how to make you stay?”</p><p>Shen Qingqiu’s breath catches in his lungs.</p><p>Ah… this child, really…</p><p>When he exhales, the breath leaves him all at once. His heart feels like it’s been mangled into broken pieces, and his throat swollen and stuck with what seems like the entire culmination of his despair and anguish, but every tear that spilled from Luo Binghe’s eyes… every word that leaves his bloodied lips… Shen Qingqiu only felt like each and every one of them was akin to a stabbing flare of pain piercing straight through his heart—</p><p>—Was it so…? Binghe had really… wanted to be with him…?</p><p>Then, if he stayed just a little while longer, acted selfish for maybe just <em> once</em>—</p><p>—Was he, could he <em> really… </em></p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="center">...stay by Binghe’s side, even if he’d end up hurting him again in the end...?</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“<em>Shizun</em>,” Luo Binghe calls brokenly again, completely consumed by his qi. “Shizun, Shizun. <em> Please don’t leave me behind again.” </em></p><p>Luo Binghe’s words sears like a brand into Shen Qingqiu’s heart, snapping him out of his thoughts. His soul trembles, lit aflame fuelled by Luo Binghe’s love and heartbreak. And belatedly, as he watches his precious disciple struggle in his own deviation, Shen Qingqiu can’t help but think, that he’d even give it all to that sticky child of his— burn all that he was, for Luo Binghe alone.</p><p>...At this point, there is no return. If that meant that Luo Binghe would be okay, wouldn’t it all be worth it in the end?</p><p>Having made a decision, Shen Qingqiu lets a fond, sad smile settle on his lips.</p><p>He tremblingly lifts his other hand, and gently settles it atop Luo Binghe’s head. Then, he strokes once, long and slow. “What has this master told you about calming your mind?” He chides softly, feeling that same overwhelming flood of adoration and fondness for his blackened lotus spill from his heart and through his lips.</p><p>His blackened protagonist must have heard it somehow, for he only cries harder even with his mind almost fully consumed and barely aware. Shen Qingqiu shakily slips himself off the edges of the bed, tumbling down onto his knees when his thighs quivers and collapses from his weight. His knees sting with a sharp, cutting pain, but Shen Qingqiu pays it no heed, and pulls Luo Binghe into an embrace instead.</p><p>Luo Binghe’s bruising grip on his wrist slackens slightly from the embrace, and Shen Qingqiu only cradles him tighter. “Hush now, don’t worry,” he finds himself reassuring as he continues stroking the back of Luo Binghe’s head, pressing it into the crook of his neck. His robes become damp in no time, but Shen Qingqiu only continues to hold him firmly, even as Binghe’s demonic qi surges and lashes wildly against his skin. “Everything will be fine,” he murmurs softly into his ear. Then, sliding the hand that had been stroking Luo Binghe’s hair down to his chest where his core lies, Shen Qingqiu presses firmly against it, and continues, “Shizun promises.”</p><p>Luo Binghe trembles again in his hold, and his hand shakily comes up to clutch gingerly at the back of Shen Qingqiu’s robes as he slowly processes his shizun’s words. “Sh-Shizun…?” He breathes, eyes blown wide, momentarily stunned by Shen Qingqiu’s embrace even while in his haze.</p><p>Shen Qingqiu smiles fondly, and pats him again on the head with his other hand. Then, he pulls back slightly from the embrace, only to see Luo Binghe staring at him with wide, dilated eyes, the tears still spilling like blood from that same glimmering red. </p><p>“Shizun…?” Luo Binghe whispers again, not comprehending.</p><p>With a palm still pressed firmly against Luo Binghe’s chest, Shen Qingqiu tremblingly slides his other hand back down from Luo Binghe’s hair to caress his cheek, cupping it tenderly in his palm. Luo Binghe’s cheek is sticky and wet in his palm, and with that same gentle smile still etched onto his lip, Shen Qingqiu trails his thumb to wipe away the tears at the corner of Luo Binghe’s eye.</p><p>Luo Binghe only blinks tearily again at him, his eyes clouded from tears and the haze of his qi deviation.</p><p>Then, with that same palm still pressed firmly against his core and his other hand cupping at Luo Binghe’s cheek, Shen Qingqiu presses his lips softly to Luo Binghe’s reddened eyelid, and kisses away the film of tears clinging onto his lashes. “Binghe should take care of himself while this master is gone. Don’t let it consume your mind anymore.” </p><p>The meaning behind Shen Qingqiu’s actions is as clear as day; even with Xin Mo consuming most of his mind, Luo Binghe’s eyes widen, and he starts to panic.  </p><p>“No, nonono, Shizun <em> please,</em>” Luo Binghe’s breath catches in his chest, horror suddenly dawning upon him at what Shen Qingqiu is planning to do. The terrifying realisation only makes his qi lash out wilder under his skin, surging in torrents and seemingly about to burst out in frenzied waves, but Luo Binghe only desperately scrambles to clutch at Shen Qingqiu’s wrist at his cheek again. </p><p>“Shizun, no, please— you can’t do this,” his fingers quiver against the weak pulse in Shen Qingqiu’s wrist. “Shizun, Shizun, what are you planning, please don’t—” he stammers frantically, barely able to even get a proper sentence out. His voice cracks. “Not for me— I can’t do this again— This disciple—”</p><p>Shen Qingqiu only lets out a soft huff, and leans back down to gently press another soft kiss to Luo Binghe’s other eyelid. “Silly child, when will you ever stop crying?” he teases, and pats again lightly at Luo Binghe’s cheek. </p><p>“Shizun, <em>no,</em> please,” Luo Binghe scrabbles to clutch at him desperately again. Xin Mo’s demonic tendrils clings onto his limbs like sludges of vines, and Shen Qingqiu knows there is no other way. “Don’t go,” Luo Binghe begs, and fumbles to grasp tighter at Shen Qingqiu. “Shizun, please stop leaving me behind, don’t go to a place I can’t follow— <em>Shizun</em>—<em>”</em></p><p>His words are immediately cut short again when Shen Qingqiu leans back down to press his lips softly to his forehead— to that demonic mark blazing and burning away. He lets his lips linger for just the slightest bit longer, and then smiles softly at his disciple again when he parts.</p><p>“It’ll be alright. This time, this master will be the one to find you instead,” he promises, and then cradles him in his arms again. “Be good, now. Wait for me.”</p><p>Then, an explosion of qi, blindingly bright and warm—</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>—and then Shen Qingqiu slumps forward into Luo Binghe’s hold.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Luo Binghe remains kneeling stiffly, his mind suddenly clear after Shen Qingqiu’s self-destruction, so blindingly <em> aware </em> that it hurts to even just <em> breathe</em>—</p><p>—Shizun’s body is cold and limp in his arms.</p><p>The hands that had wrapped itself around Luo Binghe’s shoulders and threaded itself at the back of his head are now hanging limply by his sides.</p><p>With trembling arms and his breath stuck painfully in his throat, Luo Binghe slowly, carefully adjusts Shen Qingqiu, and settles him on his lap.</p><p>Shizun’s body is paper light.</p><p>Curved up in that same gentle smile, his lips are stained red with blood.</p><p>Luo Binghe stares, his mind a muddle with the colours of red bleeding and swirling into his vision. His shizun sits at the center of it, cold and lifeless.</p><p>Luo Binghe mumbles.</p><p><br/>
